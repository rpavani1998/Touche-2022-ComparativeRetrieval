Connections to Servers From Dirk Janssen <dirkj_AT_u.arizona.edu>: Here are several good ways of working on your laptop from your desktop machine. If you have a separate desktop machine at work, you might want to use that as a terminal server to your laptop. This means you get the larger screen and the better keyboard, without having to worry about syncing files. The easiest way to do this is to install ssh on both sides, and ssh from your desktop (running X) to the laptop. Ssh will provide a secure connection and, crucially, a secure X connection between the two machines. If you type, for example,emacs & in the ssh shell, emacs will start a window on your desktop machine while running on your laptop. There are various ways in which you can make this situation more productive\/complicated.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=f481335a-9f44-59a6-830e-425c8fa21587&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0715wb-30-18724___7","_score":60.813362,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"I am looking to sell a laptop \/ desktop Reply Dealer New I am looking to sell a laptop \/ desktop .

Their greater speed and capacity make them better suited for video editing, computer aided design, and high-end gaming. A larger keyboard makes it easier to type and larger screen makes it easier to view. People using desktops are also generally less prone to ergonomic problems, such as neck and back strain from slumping over a small machine. Unless you're near an outlet, laptops are also limited by their battery life. And laptops are more easily stolen than larger desktop PCs, which is a big factor in organizational settings. Workarounds are available, however, to mitigate these issues. You can use a supplemental mouse, keyboard, and\/or monitor with a laptop PC. Laptop stands can improve the ergonomics without requiring supplemental devices. AViiQ has recently introduced its Portable Laptop Stand which, unlike most other laptop stand, folds up so you can carry it along with the laptop.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=02b59616-116d-53ab-8414-885ef822bc3e&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-1704wb-26-13340___1","_score":59.8443,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"DESKTOP | 101 Laptop Reviews 101 Laptop Reviews Laptop reviews from real users Laptop Deals Gaming Laptops Netbook Reviews Best laptops 2011 Laptop bags About Us Posts Acer Alienware Asus Dell Fujitsu HP Laptop Deals Lenovo Samsung Sony Toshiba Tag Archives: DESKTOP NATIVE INSTRUMENTS TRAKTOR SCRATCH PRO 2 KEYBOARD STICKER FOR DESKTOP, LAPTOP AND NOTEBOOK 22.

While desktops are more practical for home, laptops are mobile so you can actually get the best of both worlds. When deciding on laptop versus desktop here are some considerations and five reasons why a laptop maybe a better choice. 1. Mobility The number one argument for laptops is of course mobility and portability. Laptops offer full computer capabilities without the hassle of a plug. They can be used at the beach as well as at home at your workstation, desk or couch while watching TV. You certainly could not do that with a desktop. And because today's laptops offer full and powerful features, they can actually serve as replacement laptops, such as several Dell computers models. The other advantage is the ability to surf the web to shop or check email from anywhere, which can be especially beneficial for work and business or to just communicate with friends and family.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=8d498f77-74b7-54e7-ab83-6c8d50e5ab18&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0310wb-00-22523___6","_score":56.008244,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"User Reviews Write a review Be the first to write a review Related Guide Picks Best Desktop Replacements Best Budget Laptops Best Thin & Light Laptops Best Ultraportable Laptops Best Netbooks Suggested Reading What Computer Should I Buy?

So, if you need a computer for data storage, it is advisable to go for a desktop. If you need a computer for research, for taking notes, or for any other purpose that demands mobility, buying a laptop will be the better choice. Not only a laptop is movable, but it can also work on battery power giving you the freedom to work wherever you want. If your work involves graphic editing, animations, designing etc., choosing a desktop is advisable because of the larger screen sizes and flexibility of desktop monitors. With a laptop, you get all the peripherals built into the machine, which need to be separately bought in case of a desktop. This may be either good or bad depending upon your choice of peripherals and budget.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=8a0f3d22-74f6-5476-8177-d52c15cecece&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0004wb-13-17260___9","_score":55.008987,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"I'd rather have choice via inexpensive adapters than be locked into SD\/SDHC\/SDXC Write a review 2 out of 2 people found this helpful.

If I did, a Hassy would already be in my camera bag. Best regards, Bill Reply Craig says: September 12, 2009 at 4:20 AM After sending my Canon 20D back to Canon 5 times; getting a brand new Canon 1Ds MKII with a bad sensor; and sending my Canon 1Ds MKIII back to Canon for underexposing 2 full stops, I was ready to sell all my Canon lenses and move back to Nikon. Based upon Thom Hogan\u2019s (www.bythom.com) recent review of the Nikon D3X, and many other reviews of the Nikon, I have reconsidered this decision. I am a landscape photographer and I am very happy with the 1Ds MKIII\u2019s resolution, just not happy with Canon quality-control. It seems the D3X has its own set of problems that have been overlooked by reviewers that are afraid to honestly expose the flaws of this new camera.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=c2420c66-fd8d-5145-a84b-a7b717f7add1&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0001wb-98-37238___5","_score":46.01277,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"The T3i is also more prone to chromatic aberration than the D5100. The Nikon also produces excellent images in both RAW and JPEG, and it does an even better job of keeping thenoise down at high ISOs. Best of all, it doesn't seem to share other DSLRs' tendencies to overexpose in high contrast situations. It also has better dynamic range and color depth than the Canon. In Conclusion I personally find the layout and control system of the Nikon confusing and somewhat lacking in key areas. However, image quality is where it counts, so, if you're new to digital cameras, then the Nikon has the edge. Both cameras have their plus points though, and users are unlikely to be disappointed by either machine. Suggested Reading Canon 7D Vs. Nikon D300s Canon T3 Vs.

Because a 5D that shot 24p at full HD resolution would have been a very important camera. For Canon to have come so close and botched that one detail is almost unbearable. Maybe we can get Canon to offer a 24 fps mode in a future firmware update. Someone point me at Canon\u2019s headquarters. I need to stand on their lawn with a boombox over my head.

The Nikon looks like it brightens just as much, but starting from a lower light level the result is better. The best outright result from an exposure perspective came from the Pentax which underexposed the RAW file, but brightened it and added just the right amount of contrast to give a near perfect JPEG file. Now, stacking the JPEGs up against each other, the Nikon file is the sharpest with more detail. The Pentax file has the most contrast, but also slightly more tonal variation in the shadows.

Not sure about in the rest of the world, but their distribution within Australia didn't move with the times, and hence their availability was poorer than other brands. They have also pretty much abandoned the serious pro market, leaving that for Canon and Nikon.

With Nikon finally unleashing its D800 semi-pro full-frame DSLR on the market, Canon users are left wondering when an upgrade to the much loved 5D Mark II will be appearing. In the meantime, could the impressive specs on board the Nikon D800 potentially be enough to kill off its biggest rival?

David Manzi , October 09, 2006; 02:33 P.M. Well, I love the 5D camera, but to dismiss Nikon as a small company with clever optical engineers is, well, way, way off. No, Nikon cannot match Canon's sensor technology;they are not the electronics giant that Canon is. But if Canon is so capable, why is their flash metering system so inferior compared to Nikon? Why can't Canon create a metering system like Nikon's color 3D matrix metering? Why can't Canon make a wide angle zoom as good as Nikon's 17-35 2.8? Canon's wide zooms are good, but very far from the level of the Nikon. Canon still has a bit to learn from Nikon in some areas. Antonio (Italy) , October 13, 2006; 03:46 P.M.

So, is there an overall winner from the test? I\u2019m afraid not. The Pentax is as good as the Nikon and Canon at ISO100, and better at a number of things, but the image quality drops off when the ISO goes higher.

PHP \u201cjust happened\u201d. Not to knock PHP (I actuallylove working in PHP) \u2014 but Python is just a better language. [Note: I still am viscerally troubled by the using whitespace to indicate code structure, instead of just using braces like the rest of the sane world, but it\u2019s a relatively minor gripe]. 2. Python has a \u201cclear\u201d web framework winner: Although conceptually I like having choices (and I believe in openness), practically, I really,really like standards. All things being equal, I much prefer that all of us are working with the same frameworks and libraries. Python mostly has that with Django. It\u2019s close to the de-facto choice for web frameworks in Python. Maybe not quite as dominant as Rails in Ruby-land \u2014 but close. Contrast that to PHP where we have Symfony, Zend, CodeIgniter, Kohana \u2014 and others. On the one hand, this kind of competition is good. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re all great frameworks (I use CodeIgniter right now), but the fact that there\u2019s no clear winner means that the market is fragmented. And, fragmentation is bad. It\u2019sparticularly bad when it comes to web frameworks. The learning curve these days is not a new language (it takes a proficient programmer just a few days to get her arms around the basics of a new language). The learning curve is with the framework. The deeper and richer the framework is, the more there is to learn. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Ilove frameworks (dating back all the way to the Object Windows Library that Borland had for TurboPascal). Frameworks have an upfront cost, but provide a ton of value long-term. But, if there are a bunch of different frameworks floating around, the odds that any given person is working in the same framework you are lower. And as such, getting someone new up to speed takes longer. In Python land, the clear web framework winner is Django. This means that if I find a great Python developer for the team (more on this later), they\u2019ve likely used Django. That makes life much easier. 3.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=a193ef1c-62aa-59ce-bc04-b789dfd36aaa&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0011wb-34-22801___1","_score":41.74366,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"Stackato, a Private PaaS for Python, PHP, Java, and more, gets Management and Monitoring | Javalobby LOG IN or JOIN Home Refcardz Microzones NoSQL Zone HTML5 Zone DevOps Zone Solr-Lucene Windows Phone 7 .NET Zone Python Zone Zones Agile Zone Cloud Zone Mobile Zone Javalobby Web Builder Zone IDEs and Tools Eclipse Zone JetBrains Zone NetBeans Zone Languages PHP Zone Groovy Zone Architects Zone Book Zone Server Zone Library Links Snippets Trending: Lucene \u00b7 CSS \u00b7 Python \u00b7 PyPy \u00b7 Scala \u00b7 Heroku \u00b7 Solr \u00b7 IndexedDB \u00b7 Amazon Cloud \u00b7 Cloud Foundry \u00b7 WP7 \u00b7 ASP.NET Lucene 3.6 Gets Query Time Joining Windows 8: The Facts About ARM, Metro, and the Blu...

One major benefit is that all Python programs look similar, since indentation is a language requirement and not a matter of style. This makes it easier to read and understand other people's Python code.\" One of the other features and main differences between Rails and Django is that Django has an \"Automatic admin interface\" which you can either take it or leave it.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=7103bad9-7ad7-5ea0-94ae-42793a4ebc84&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-1901wb-09-07642___9","_score":41.511505,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"Thanks - and welcome to the Django community! 3.

Are OpenOffice and its derivatives actually as good as Microsoft Office? These are just a couple of the questions debated this week by a panel of experts at the CeBIT America show in New York City. Comparing Linux and Windows security amounts to a \"chicken and egg\" issue, according to Kathy Ivens, an author and consultant. Given that Linux is a more secure environment, it's tough to know whether this is because Linux is \"inherently more secure,\" or because Windows is still the more prevalent environment, Ivens said, during a panel moderated by Paul Gillin, VP of Editorial at TechTarget.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=270c2569-894b-5d69-b250-d1ce4d4c85dd&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0008wb-38-11631___6","_score":45.886543,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"Linux is a higher risk option than Windows NT. This is the NT that isyears late? The one with more than 30 million lines of new code? NT looks pretty risky to many of us. All systems are vulnerable to security issues, however it's important to note that Linux uses the same security model as the original UNIX implementations- a model that was not designed from the ground up to be secure. One could also argue that Window - even NT - was not designed for multi-user environments and the the need to protect users - and programs - from each other. Linux security is all-or-nothing. Administrators cannot delegate administrative privileges: a user who needs any administrative capability must be made a full administrator, which compromises best security practices. There is some truth here. The \"superuser\" model has a number of problems, and utilities like \"sudo\" are a sort of fragile kludge made necessary by this model.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=4b7ea0f4-dc13-5fc3-95c4-98278ff78d0a&index=cw12&raw&plain"}}],"4":[{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0104wb-35-31967___1","_score":64.4716,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"Government says trains better than planes | Campaign for Better Transport Better Transport Home About us Campaigns Blogs In your area Media Take action Contact us Donate donate Search this site: Government says trains better than planes 5 May: Transport Secretary Lord Adonis has said rail journeys should replace short-haul flights, and is planning a high speed rail line to achieve this. We're delighted the Government has realised that many plane journeys should be made by train instead. But high speed rail is only a good idea if it replaces flights, instead of just adding to the number of journeys we make. So Lord Adonis must cancel plans to expand Heathrow airport. If he is really committed to phasing out short-haul flights, this expansion won't be needed.

Yet it almost bumps the top of the chart on sulfur dioxide emissions. If Boston were less dependent on fossil fuels, the numbers would look very different. In fact, as these researchers point out, all comparisons can change drastically if energy sources, technologies, and demographics change.

Chinese people take responsibility for their own health most seriously, and the use of medicine and disease prevention forms a continuum with food and nutrition. Although most Chinese people may believe in the superior diagnostic powers of western biomedicine, many prefer TCM treatments particularly for chronic diseases where the side effects of western biomedicine are seen, rightly, to often far outweigh the benefits.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=6b17d629-5c99-5428-8e11-c7f3a9377d04&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-1812wb-72-01015___9","_score":27.085585,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"Tags: books, chinese medicine, chinese philosophy Filed Under: Practitioners notes, Students notes Chinese Medicine Notes Blog- What & Why Posted on November 11, 2007 by Yael7 Comments Hi everyone, We are happy to be writing these words, as we are starting the new blog which we hope will be a main source of information about Chinese Medicine for you all. We were thinking about what should be a good way to start this new platform, and we have decided that it\u2019s best to start with introducing this blog\u2019s intentions and missions: This blog is going to grow due to the love we have for Chinese Medicine, and will have 100% Chinese Medicine oriented content. This blog aims to be a place to all those who are interested in Chinese Medicine- those of you who are interested in this field, those who are students of this wonderful philosophy, those who want to be students but just didn\u2019t get round to it, those who are patients and want to know more about what their practitioner just did when he used that needle around the elbow\u2026 Chinese Medicine Notes will provide important information on various topics, and hopefully it will become one of your regular stops on the world wide web, giving you interesting things to read while taking a break from work or drinking your first cup of coffee in the morning (or herbal tea, which ever you prefer).","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=4bab27d1-382a-5d01-a423-ac5f85aef66b&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0011wb-31-37209___11","_score":27.060019,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"BBC: In order to make time for writing, speaking and traveling, do you have to pick and choose the cases you take on?

On a practical level, research shows that we tend to gravitate toward the animal with which we were raised. Another big factor is living space and age. Apartment dwellers in urban areas are more likely to have cats or small dogs, while families living in the suburbs are more apt to have larger dogs like retrievers or bull mastiffs.

Gas Charcoal Grills Gas charcoal grills are dual purpose grills that allow you to have the best of both worlds. Charcoal is preferred by many outdoor cooks for meat, but the separate gas grill allows you to cook all your side dishes right along with your grilled meats. No more running back and forth between the kitchen and patio to complete your meal. When all your kitchen helpers disappear, you can handle it all yourself with a dual purpose combination grill. Gas charcoal grills come in different sizes. Some models are only marginally larger than an average grill. Others, such as the twin chamber charcoal and gas grills, are a bit larger. The larger models are excellent choices for a complete outdoor kitchen.

See our Complete Barbeque and Grilling Recipe Collection. Charcoal Grilling Charcoal grilling might not offer the same level of convenience as gas, but it does boast one benefit that stands out above all others: smoke flavor. The dry, white-hot heat of charcoal sears meat quickly, creating a crusty, caramelized exterior and smoky flavor. Of course, charcoal grilling requires more time and attention than gas, from building and lighting the briquettes to waiting for the coals to get hot to managing the flame. Since you can't dial down the heat of white-hot coals, it's a good strategy to leave empty spaces on the lower grill grate (areas without briquettes). These cool spaces allow for better control, letting you sear food first over the hot spots before transferring it to cooler parts to finish cooking.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=a7134cc0-9772-5431-8668-09bd5fafbe9b&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0205wb-99-23127___2","_score":82.815216,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"Kalamazoo Dragon Burners\u2122 deliver over 115 BTUs of grilling power to each square inch of the primary grilling area, so these are seriously capable gas grills.

Once someone gets used to the different approaches on either side, they will prefer doing their work in their familiar OS. Some programs, like Microsoft Office, release OS-specific versions where each is a year or two after the other, so whichever was released last is often better. The PC\u2019s current version is 2007, and the Mac\u2019s is 2008. Office 2008 fixes some issues I had with 2007. Mac Cost Macs cost more than Windows PCs. Mac users may argue that, but there\u2019s really no argument. My high-end MacBook Pro cost easily double what I would have spent for a similarly equipped PC. It was worth it because supporting Macs is part of our business model, but I would otherwise have a hard time justifying the cost difference.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=c4db5455-de7e-5cf7-ba6f-ae35dc3c7322&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0604wb-65-25561___13","_score":53.857323,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"You can build a PC with hardware that isn't identical but PERFORMS better for CHEAPER.

The computer is to be used primarily for your school work and for college next year. The computer you eventually select, a PC or Macintosh, will best fit your needs and be acceptable to your parents. The Task Your task is to investigate a PC and Mac, and examine the features of each microcomputer. As you conduct your investigation, pay particular attention to; memory, speed, expandability, storage, peripherals, software and price. You will compare and contrast comparable computers on each platform by gathering information from a variety of sources. Determine which computer is best for you and where you will purchase you new computer. You will need to do your homework and convince your parents that this is the best computer that will fit your educational needs. When you complete your investigation you will report your findings and preference to the class using a PowerPoint presentation which will be uploaded to the web server.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=11a51353-e329-5d7e-959a-f752bbbcb686&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-1002wb-29-10352___7","_score":53.735855,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"Any valid file name you save on Windows is OK when bringing it to a Mac.

In Pepsi's ads (as well as private blind tests conducted by Coke) a majority of consumers tested chose Pepsi. This set off a panic which led Coke to tamper with it's #1 selling formula and come up with a new one. New Coke was born. By all scientific reasoning, New Coke should have been a hands down success.

In 1975 Pepsi beat Coke quite easily in the original Pepsi Taste Test Challenge. Malcolm Gladwell in his 2005 book Blink proposed that the reason consumers chose Pepsi was due to it being a \u201csip test\u201d as opposed to drinking a full can. Pepsi being the sweeter product wins in a sip taste but a full can overwhelm with sugar, which is why Coke still dominates the market. Nice hypothesis Malcolm, but as Buyology proves, science beats speculation every time. In 2003, 67 people were given the test again, but this time they used the fMRI machine. The results were the same as twenty-eight years earlier. Pepsi was again the champ.

For example, the Jeep Wrangler is a very good vehicle for what it's supposed to do, but what it does well is pretty much one thing, so it isn't a great car in my opinion. Some could argue a great car has purity, so something like the Wrangleris a great car.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=5e9c7873-95f0-5968-917a-b4a579d12adf&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0401wb-58-06296___15","_score":30.355614,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"Who knows how good they could have become had they gone into their 2nd generation.

With precise handling and good roadholding, the Audi is entertaining to drive, and unsettled by only the bumpiest surfaces. It grips well and turns into corners crisply, and rides comfortably over most surfaces. Although the Audi ultimately falls short of the BMW 3 Series for driver enjoyment, it's perfectly acceptable. This A4 retains Audi's tradition for clarity, quality and comfort inside the cabin. Controls are logically laid out and feel durable, and four people can sit in comfort.

By Ed Hellwig | March 12, 2012 Comments (14) You may have noticed a greater number of new vehicles with odd looking headlights. It's a trend that BMW largely started awhile back with its corona ring design, quickly followed up by Audi and its LEDs. Now, just about vehicle has some signature light cue up front, some more interesting than others. Our X3 has BMW's latest take on headlight design and it's slightly more complicated version of its traditional design. The lights themselves work well and they don't look half bad when they're glowing eerily after you hit the unlock button.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=7ffaa0b0-0efd-5124-8061-f53319842cf5&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0805wb-17-11774___2","_score":24.433325,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"edited by New Car Test Drive Introduction \u00bb Interior \/ Walk Around \u00bb Driving Impressions \u00bb Summary Introduction 2010 Audi A4 The Audi A4 must be doing something right.

In a segment where engineering excellence sells cars, Audi claims the turbo-four A4 delivers best-in-class fuel economy, while posting quicker 0-60 mph acceleration times than six-cylinder, all-wheel-drive competitors such as the BMW 328iX, Mercedes-Benz C300 4Matic, and Lexus IS250 AWD. The A4 also has on average more passenger room than the BMW 328, Mercedes C300, or Lexus IS250.

Flat-bottom woks are now commonly available and though they provide good balance on flat stovetops, I still prefer the old-fashioned round bottoms. It is much easier to remove all particles of food from round woks without scraping the seasoning, enabling you to stir-fry two or more batches of food without having to clean in between batches. I use a 16\" carbon steel wok with a round bottom on a gas stove. I find that the round bottom works better with a wok shovel. A round-bottom wok may sit securely on the burners of your stove, but most likely you will need a wok ring that fits your stove well. I like the 16-inch wok better than the smaller standard 14-inch size: you can just as easily cook smaller quantities for a few people, or a feast for a larger group \u2013 that is, if your burner is hot enough to take a loaded wok (12,000 b.t.u.'s or better) If you have an electric stove, you might find that the flat-bottomed woks work better, but because the wok shovel is intended for a round-bottom, you might substitute with some other implement (such as a wooden spoon) that would not scrape off the seasoning at the corner where round sides meet flat bottom.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=27e25217-73ab-57fc-a257-6c5f59716b03&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0208wb-73-03549___4","_score":38.133957,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"Info From the mailbag: which stove is better for the environment, gas or electric?

According to sauna authority Mikkel Aaland, who wrote Sweat, a 1978 history of international bathing customs, \u201cWhether to use an electric, gas, or wood burning stove is the first decision in sauna building.\u201d And the author asserts that it\u2019s a decision that may be influenced by geographic location.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=51680478-bc3b-54b4-9cb2-2ac96c669e7e&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0717wb-46-11563___11","_score":35.191154,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"(What would be the procedure for that, anyway?) > if safety is a concern, you should be able to do this either inside or out, the only reason the keep gas running to a stove is to feed the pilot. most homes that have a gas line to the kitchen will have a valve to cut the line right before it hits the stove. if you sont have one, you should. its a simple, in-line valve, and depending on where it is installed, you could easily turn off gas to the whole stove when not in use. this makes lighting the stove a three step process (1. gas to stove, 2. light a match, 3. gas to burner) but if you can hang with that, its unlikely your boys will ever turn on the gas by mistake.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=1b47448c-4a9e-5260-b582-a0660a5f1bb4&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-1803wb-66-15279___6","_score":35.10093,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"It shouldn\u2019t be soggy at all.

If the liquid or solid burned, the whole candle would light up at once. The \"our stove burns wax gas!\" line is just a gimmick to make it sound fancy.

It will fit almost all of the missions the 757 is currently serving (except for trans-Atlantic flights) and it will do it with pretty good efficiency compared to what Boeing is offering right now. Are they serious? Well, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this was both a warning shot over the bow to Boeing as well as a serious discussion. American Airlines really does need a better fleet going forward and it cannot afford to wait until 2019\/2020 to get started. The 737-800 is a good fit as a MD-80 replacement but not as a 757 replacement.

Airbus will be pitching the A320\/A321 NEOs and Boeing will be pitching the 737s (new and old) and it will be tough to call this one. I think who comes out on top in this order will be determined by who has slots for earlier deliveries of the more re-engined aircraft. If Airbus has slots, it will get orders. We know that Boeing has slots but order delivery dates are somewhat murky, in my opinion. I do not look for Bombardier CSeries or Embraer E190\/195 aircraft to be ordered in this. They\u2019re smaller and Delta has that seat range covered right now. My best guess? I tilt towards this being Boeing\u2019s order. I think it might be won on price and an opportunity to get re-engined aircraft just a tad earlier than Airbus.

I don\u2019t always sense that they\u2019re defending the right things in the marketplace but, rather, defending their image against all comers. Reacting isn\u2019t always good. Take the Bombardier CSeries vs Airbus A319NEO scenario that is unfolding. Airbus COO John Leahy has actually come out and called for Bombardier to cancel the airplane. Airbus has pitted its A319NEO against the CS300 as the better aircraft and I\u2019d like to point something out. It\u2019s a mainliner by any definition and one based on a design that is 20+ years old. Boeing\/McDonnel Douglas pitted the 717 against the Embraer 170\/190 and got its hat handed to them. Picking your fights is an art. Some do it well, some don\u2019t. Boeing has done pretty good until recently although I think the influx of McDonnel Douglas execs hurt them. McDonnel Douglas execs never could decide when to fight so ended up hardly ever fighting. Airbus execus fight like bulldogs even when someone just happens to walk nearby. Airbus needs to understand that it isn\u2019t going to compete everywhere all of the time. Fighting off Bombardier and Embraer just expends money on low return investments. That said, Airbus also just racked up 700+ firm orders for the A320NEO and, that, my friends, is very healthy competition. Say what you want (like it doesn\u2019t include any US network carriers or Boeing customers), they put it up there in 6 months and they did it much like Boeing did the 787 orders. This is what you politely call a tap on the head for Boeing.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=97bcabac-5cc5-5660-8d9d-6006d79638a9&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-1106wb-05-01125___2","_score":40.914104,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"The latter point is a bit of an eyebrow-raiser.

These concerns have been exacerbated by the announcement from China\u2019s central government that it wants the airlines to defer deliveries next year. As we pointed out some weeks ago, this is highly unusual: China historically has been a stalwart through bad times for Airbus and Boeing, growing and ordering airplanes when other regions in the world were going through major downturns. This has led some to particularly point to the new Airbus assembly facility in China as a risk factor for Airbus. There certainly is sound reason for concern, but so far this is overwrought. We participated in a conference last week that included Airbus and Boeing officials. During our private conversations with them, we came away more comfortable that for 2009 at least, the two companies are not going to see major declines in deliveries, based on current market conditions.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=468684b3-b584-57bc-a673-4c6ccb55fb10&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-1900tw-17-02938___10","_score":39.6334,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"Remco`s Great Pictures by member Remco64 Just nice taken photos around the world!

I think you are right about the A-332 not being long for this world. I think it will end production (but still be offered) within 10 years, or so. I also think Airbus will cancel the A-358, as Boeing did with the B-783. The B-77W will eventually kill off the A-333, too.

The airlines were not satisfied and Airbus committed euro4 billion to a new design to be called the A350. The original version of the A350 superficially resembled the A330 due to its common fuselage assembly.

The biggest drawback of ASP is that it's a proprietary system that is natively used only on the Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) platform. This limits its availability to Win32 based servers. There are a couple of projects in the works that allows ASP to function with other environments and webservers:\u00bb InstantASP from \u00bb Halcyon (commercial), Chili!Soft ASP from \u00bb Chili!Soft (commercial), and\u00bb Mono (open-source).

Comparing PHP and ASP Both PHP and ASP are great solutions for most projects that need the server power and capabilities available with them. Both ASP and PHP have several tools and available options with their GUI options. PHP is capable of being installed quickly and easily with many tools server side which can include image manipulation, uploading, email systems and much more. ASP is designed to require registration of components and modules to make each tool possible.

Some PHP aficionados would also argue that PHP is faster than ASP. One of PHP's main benefits is that it is extremely feature-rich, and doesn't experience many of the complications involved with ASP. Because PHP is open source, features such as FTP, file uploads, XML and email are included, whereas these have to be paid for as add-ons for ASP users. Conclusion Lots more information about using ASP and PHP is available on the web. Safe to say, the two options have their benefits and their disadvantages. ASP is generally considered the best option for ecommerce websites, while PHP is the most popular for discussion boards. But this is only the tip of the iceberg.

The key elements of ASP include objects that interface to backend databases, session and application states, and request and response parameters. An ASP web page consists of static elements, such asHTML tags, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as VBScript code. The VBScript code interacts with the ASP objects to dynamically generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are returned to the client along with the static content.

Netbeans is far closer to Microsoft''s Visual Basic environment which is by far one of the best development environments ever made. Eclipse on the other hand feels like a glorified form of Wordpad. IBM just can''t make a good user interface to save their lives, need I remind anyone of OS\/2 and Lotus Notes! So if you want a good IDE that is free, is Java standard, and runs on just about anything, there is only one choice and that is NetBeans.

Egoboo is also supposed to have a network play feature, but it's broken in its present state. Fixing the particle graphics is easy, says Ben, but the network issue will be tougher to resolve. The networking challenge is typical for this type of game.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=f4826805-12a2-5716-8454-bcc5ea71df69&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0800wb-30-18549___6","_score":21.756937,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"I've came up with a another idea for it: This one looks like a husky for sure (is a vectorized photo of a husky actually), brought to you byInkscape.

Yesterday a coworker passed me a link about an OpenGL virtualization project fromGSoC '06, VMGL. Basically it allows you to show OpenGL accelerated graphics of applications running in a virtualized guest OS like Linux. The results of the benchmarks are just impressive. Almost native performance and concurrent execution of various games like Quake3 or Unreal. It's been tested with Xen and VMware as far as I have read. Further work to achieve the same features with Direct3D is planned.

That is when we launched the first-generation Prius as the world\u2019s first mass-production gasoline-electric hybrid.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=b05700bc-e5eb-518f-91a0-6fbab5e653b7&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0804wb-77-31720___3","_score":54.807922,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"The move comes on the heels of recent changes to Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, which now say that automakers will need to reach a fleet average of 54.5 mpg by model year 2025.

Avoid recipes that are deep fried. You know what\u2019s not food for you! 2. Create the interest by blending flavors across cuisines. Grab a starch from one country and add a sauce from another. Try a thai red curry with penne pasta, then add shrimp or chicken depending on what your family prefers. Top chicken tikka masala on a flat bread or pizza. Serve a gazpacho with shells or macaroni pasta for a delicious & healthy meal. Read more on fusion cooking. 3.

Both can cause overdose -- and, in recent years, each has surpassed aspirin as a cause of hospitalization. And both acetaminophen and ibuprofen appear to damage kidneys with regular use. Some reports have even linked ibuprofen to a reversible, temporary form of kidney failure in as many as a quarter of patients studied. Should none of these over-the-counter drugs satisfactorily reduce discomfort, pain may be a sign of a more serious problem warranting a doctor's attention.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=382b45f7-1e4f-5bd0-b7bf-bd5431652a5f&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0200wb-08-27968___7","_score":103.6378,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"This is especially effective after medication is given -- otherwise the temperature might bounce right back up.

Prescription NSAIDs include naproxen (Naprosyn, Anaprox), diclofenac (Voltaren), tolmetin (Tolectin), ketoprofen (Orudis, Oruvail), indomethacin (Indocin). These drugs are used not only for relieving pain in periodontal disease but also for slowing the disease process. NSAIDs block inflammatory enzymes triggered by cytokines, which are important immune factors in periodontal disease. A number of NSAIDs are being investigated for their benefits in reducing gingivitis and slowing progression of periodontal disease.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=c3dbf2a5-a753-5c9d-ad14-9da3b3653360&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0409wb-31-13596___9","_score":78.846176,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"What should I avoid while taking ibuprofen?

Secondly because even with this kind of care, the utility knife sustained a small chip about 1.25\" from the point end, during this test. Not noticed immediately, we assumed it might have happened when we sliced through hard raw potatoes, turnips or carrots. These were the hardest foods and during slicing you could hear the blade against the cutting board. There could also have been a little grit on the unpeeled potatoes and maybe this caused the ceramic to chip. Whatever the cause, it remains a mystery. This was most unfortunate and very disappointing. Overall Impression Ceramic knives are very different than steel knives in handling as well as function and they should be used only for slicing fruits, vegetables and boneless meats.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=4a374fd3-a4d2-5fae-aeec-e171b8386145&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0000tw-35-12269___3","_score":46.298515,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"Rust proof.

So if you have a Japanese or other knife with a similar polished edge (the Misono Japanese knives have polished edges), then a ceramic is a good choice. I personally think that some knives with a ground edge (most German knives) can keep that nice \"bite\" in their edge better with a traditional steel (metal), but the difference can be subtle.

Shun values a sharp knife that will hold its edge a long time. Knives that have good wear resistance, in general are more difficult to sharpen.

Why Ceramic Knives Are a Different Breed of Knife Ceramic knives on the other hand, are not as diverse as sizes and styles go and are generally limited to a few practical lengths. Quality ceramic knives are made of materials that are stronger than diamonds, usually zirconium oxide. Most ceramic blades are white, though there is a growing number of grey and black ceramic knives. The hardness of the ceramic gives these knives their long-lasting good looks, as well as a razor sharp edge that does not require sharpening for years. That is why many chefs love using ceramic knives. This sharpness makes slicing easier, allows precise cuts and extremely thin slices. The ceramic blade is stronger than steel but unfortunately, is more fragile because it is more brittle. That means that if you drop a ceramic knife or attempt to cut bone or frozen foods with one, it can break or chip.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=26d7ff24-e16d-549c-967e-9f68c142fffc&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0606wb-36-15417___2","_score":43.32735,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"Ultra sharp and will stay sharp 10x longer than steel Won't brown foods or transfer metallic taste or smell Rust-proof, stain-proof and germ resistant Comfortably ergonomic and perfectly balanced Proprietary Kyocera Advanced Ceramic, Zirconia 206 Lifetime Warranty & Lifetime Sharpening Made in Japan Learn More The product 8.25\" KYOTOP Sashimi Knife has been added to comparison list. 4\" Pocket Knife Advanced ceramic blades and stainless steel handles Black Blade $130.00 Handle Color Add to Cart 5\" Pocket Knife Advanced ceramic blades and stainless steel handles Black Blade $140.00 Handle Color 2 Item(s) Show 9 15 30 per page View as: Grid List Sort By Position Name Price Top Video \"We shaved tomatoes into translucent discs and carved a whole-grain loaf into playing-card-thin toast.\u201d Revolution 5\u201d Micro-Serrated Utility Knife Popular Mechanics \u201cEasily serves up perfectly sliced vegetables, from paper thin to moderately thick.\u201d Adjustable Mandoline Slicer Eating Well See all Testimonials Shop By Currently Shopping by: Remove This Item Shop By Product: Pocket Knife Clear All Shopping Options Category Kyotop Series (2) Pocket Knives (2) Shop By Color Silver (2) Price $130.00 - $140.00 (1) $140.00 - $150.00 (1) Where to buy Contact About Us News Terms of Use Privacy Site Map Register Your Products Copyright \u00a9 2012 KYOCERA TYCOM Corporation","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=7566de9b-bac3-5aec-a44e-376505612f30&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-1601wb-31-07321___1","_score":43.144176,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"Tojiro DP Nakiri 165mm Home About Us Info\/Return Policy View Cart Privacy Policy Customer Feedback Shop By: Knife Brands Aritsugu Type A Blazen Knives Bunmei Knives Murray Carter Knives CCK Cleavers Ceramic Knives Doi Knives Dojo Knives F Dick Knives Forschner Knives Stephan Fowler Knives Fujiwara Knives Global Knives Butch Harner Knives Thomas Haslinger Knives Henckels Knives Hiromoto Knives Kaneshige Knives Kanehiro Knives Kanetsune Knives Kasumi Knives Kikuichi Knives Konosuke Knives Kramer Knives MAC Knives Adam Marr Knives Maruyoshi Knives Masahiro Knives Masamoto Knives Messermeister Knives Misono Knives Morimoto Knives Moritaka Knives Nubatama Knives Richmond Knives Rodrigue Knives Takeshi Saji Knives Shun Knives Sugimoto Knives Suisin Knives Sakai Takayuki Takeda Knives Tamahagane Knives Tanaka Knives TC Blades Devin Thomas Knives Tojiro Knives Victorinox Knives Watanabe Knives Wusthof Knives Knife Accessories Cutting Boards Hand Held Sharpeners Kitchen Tools Kitchen Shears Knife Cases Knife Handles Knife Sharpening Tutorials Knife Sharpeners Knife Sharpening Service Knife Storage Magnifiers Sayas Sharpening Accessories Sharpening Steels Sharpening Stones Straight Razors Strops Spoons Suppliers DMT Edge Pro Products Hand American Lamson & Goodnow Ken's Corner Naniwa Panini Grills Shapton Stones Wicked Edge Videos & Tutorials Knife Types Boning Knives Bread Knives Cheese Knives Chef Knives Carving Knives Cleavers Deba Knives Fillet Knives German Knives Gyutos Hankotsu Knives Honesuki Knives Japanese Knives Kiritsuke Knives Kurouchi knives Nakiri Knives Oyster Knives Paring Knives Petty Knives Santoku Knives Yanagi Sashimi Knives Steak Knives Sujihikis Sushi Knives Tomato Knives Utility Knives Usuba Knives Wa-Gyutos VG-10 Steel 52100 Steel Knives CPM-154 White #1 Steel M390 White #2 Steel SG-2 Steel AEB-L Steel VG-10 Steel ZDP-189","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=26a5e88d-2f3b-59d9-b3d0-ab9a3be64ff8&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0207wb-93-33775___17","_score":43.05513,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"The trick is to maintain the edge so you don't have to create a new one.

In general, the apples that get Morning sun until noon seem to fruit prolifically, whereas the apples that get no Morning sun, but afternoon sun seem to fruit a lot less, much more biennially. What's interesting is that for example stone fruits like peaches are much less sensitive, fruiting like crazy in the same locations. As a whole, I've noticed much more open growth near the oak trees.

Anglers casting to shaded flats, pockets behind midstream boulders and to undercut banks will likely encounter a few fish during the heat of the day, but most fish are waiting until the cooler hours of early morning and late afternoon to feed aggressively.

In the local (Maa) language Mara means spotted, which is a reference to the patches of bush and trees on the plains. Days will be spent game viewing and enjoying the Masai Mara. Early morning game drives set off at sunrise with bush breakfast in the wilderness in the morning sunlight and return to lodge hours later for lunch. During the heat of the day, relax and appreciate the silence, punctuated only by birdcalls. Afternoon game drives returns after sundown, after which you can freshen up and gather round the campfire for pre-dinner drinks.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=33003bb9-1942-594a-b4e6-69d755e11c13&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-1503wb-59-14418___39","_score":34.28147,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"Highly recommended went up into the hills during the early morning at around 4:00, so when I arrived at the slopes or around the hilltop temple, we can record the landscape with dozens of towering stupa morning fog as he accompanied the sun rises.

I like The Simpsons and South Park, but Family Guy is alot more funnier imo. The Simpsons is still good to watch, it's just not the same anymore though.

Indeed, there was, in no small sense, rather a manly satisfaction to be derived from deriding the neighboring A.C.C. as \"a basketball conference\"---by which was meant, of course, only a basketball conference, a league that had to settle for being good at hoops because it lacked the masculine fortitude to excel on the gridiron.

The thing is Superman definitely has the advantage because of all his powers, so as long as Hulk never actually got his hands on Supes, Superman could win. Though the minute Hulk got in a good hit, well that's when things change. Superman has a peak strength, the Hulk doesn't...the madder Hulk gets, the stronger he gets... so every time Superman scored some pavement busting punches Hulk would slowly be getting stronger...eventually he'd be a raging green behemoth...and as long as Superman doesn't get to use his vast plethora of powers...in a knock-down, drag-out fight...","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=8bfec6fc-da91-5016-a764-52956602624b&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-1400wb-06-30596___3","_score":83.95188,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"There is a limit to how angry someone gets...even the Hulk and even at his angriest he wouldn't be as strong as Superman.

Then there's the Abominable Snowman, a tragic scientist who's a bit like a refrigerated Incredible Hulk and turns up for a couple of pages. Superman needs some good tough monsters to fight, so I've tried to think along those lines. In most cases, the villains only get walk-on roles in this one, however. Overall, the series is more about Superman's relationships with his friends and with the world than anything else.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=e07c4c7f-3956-588d-8f91-879b42c6c98e&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0105wb-89-26953___6","_score":48.609726,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"by Answerbag Staff on June 28th, 2010 | one answer | in Comics and Comic Books Information Who in your opinion is stronger mentally, superman or batman? by mjsillman on February 7th, 2012 | 2 answers | in Comics and comic books (General) What does X-Men mean? by Answerbag Staff on July 2nd, 2010 | 6 answers | in X-Men What are the top 10 worst super villains ever? by KATTALNUVA on February 5th, 2012 | 1 person likes this | 3 answers | in Comics and comic books (General) How many X Men characters are there? by Answerbag Staff on February 26th, 2011 | 2 answers | in X-Men Who are the top 10 greatest Marvel Comics villains of all time? by KATTALNUVA on February 2nd, 2012 | 1 person likes this | one answer | in Comics and Comic Books Information Is The Hulk the strongest superhero in the Marvel universe?","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=feee4c41-a3f6-54d0-a49c-edea3d96951e&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0810wb-87-24213___21","_score":48.43199,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"I don't see any reason why it has to be different for DC or Marvel.

It\u2019s a tale of ultimate sacrifice that does not talk down to its readers but rather invites them to experience the drama along with the X-Men as this modern day tragedy unfolds. I am not a big X-Men fan but this is, without a doubt, one of the must read comic book stories of all time. NOTE: It also doesn\u2019t hurt that the wonderfulKitty Pryde makes her debut in this story as well. Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars \u2013 Long before Fear Itself, Civil War, or House of M, long before big company crossovers and big event storylines became everyday humdrum in the comic industry, there wasMarvel Super Heroes Secret Wars. This twelve issue maxi-series featured the world\u2019s greatest heroes (theAvengers, Fantastic Four, X-Men, Spider-Man and theHulk) as they are kidnapped by a being of ultimate power and whisked to the far side of the cosmos to engage in mortal combat against a small army of the Marvel U\u2019s most dangerous super villains. Not only was Secret Wars one of the first Big Event stories but with its long lasting effects on the Marvel Universe, it encapsulated everything a Big Event should be. The Thing quits the FF and the She-Hulk joins the team, the next year for the Hulk is set-up,Colossus ends his romantic relationship with Kitty Pryde, we are introduced to a new hero (Spider-Woman) and new villains (Volcana and Titania), theAbsorbing Man gets a girlfriend whom he is with to this very day, Magneto sides with the White Hats, andSpider-Man gets his black costume which later joins with Eddie Brock to becomeVenom. One of my favorite things about this story is the character-to-character interactions. This was at a time in Marvel\u2019s history when the Marvel Age was still young enough where all the heroes didn\u2019t know each other inside and out and quite frankly didn\u2019t necessarily get along. Friendships and bonds that exist today can be traced back to this original ultimate team-up. Crisis on Infinite Earths \u2013 Crisis is the biggest, best, most influential Big Event to ever be produced. It literally changed the landscape of the DC Universe. Heroes died, whole galaxies crumbled, and the DCU has never been the same since. When an unstoppable force starts to rip through the multiverse and destroy everything in its path, every single hero and villain on every single remaining parallel Earth in every single time era, from the dawn of mankind to the far-flung future, must unite to save all reality. Marv Wolfman and George Perez deliver the most epic super hero story ever told. And by the end of it, the DCU re-launched stronger and better than ever. For the next twenty-five years this would be known as the Post-Crisis DCU. Much like DC Comics is doing now with the New 52,Superman ,Wonder Woman, SHAZAM, Aquaman, Flash and the Justice League all restarted from number one and reintroduced and revamped their characters for a whole new generation, my generation. Batman: Year One told the tale of how a young rooftop vigilante outlaw became a hero. And it was all set up by the mega-event that isCrisis on Infinite Earths. Crisis features the greatest super heroes in the world fighting against the greatest threat the world has ever seen. It\u2019s just epic and a classic comic book story that absolutely must be read. Other tales of great note include: Rom the Spaceknight, Avengers: Under Siege, JLA: Rock of Ages, The Sinestro Corps War, and Annihilation.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=40b565b1-054c-520f-8723-1e87e5779745&index=cw12&raw&plain"}}],"32":[{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0301wb-85-09681___2","_score":48.90628,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"To be successful at maintaining plant health and vigor, we must choose the correct type and size container and fill with an equally well selected soil mix.

Growing Requirements Containers impose obvious restrictions on the root systems of plants. In the garden, roots are able to exploit a large volume of soil to obtain moisture and nutrients. In containers, there is a limited volume of soil providing nutrients and moisture, and drainage and aeration are reduced compared with the same soil in the garden.

They are especially good for plants that like to stay moist \u2013 eg ferns, ivies, and babies tears. They also do not need such frequent cleaning as clay. Ceramic pots often are not glazed on the bottom and can leave moisture-marks on furniture and carpets. The only problem with an undrained pot is that excess water is not removed automatically. Even with good drainage material like perlite at the bottom, excess water should be removed after watering by holding the plant at an angle with a hand over the soil so none falls out. Remember, any pot can grow a gorgeous plant, the secret is the soil \u2013 and your care holds the key to success! Moving Plants Cold weather (<50\u00b0F) Tropical plants brighten the indoors and add to our homes. However, one should be aware that these plants do not like the cold and will suffer damage from even brief exposure to air near freezing. When transporting them in winter (or any day when the temperature is below 50\u00b0!), it is important that plants be carefully wrapped. Wrap small plants in newspaper (roll pot to make a tube and fold over the excess paper at the top). Place larger plants (or several newspapered small plants) in a large plastic garbage bag. Blow into the bag to create a bubble of warm air and seal the bag tightly. Warm your car up and move your plants directly from the heated house to the heated car. Drive straight to your plant\u2019s new home.

Pruning. Often a major branch must be removed, either to keep the plant the size you want or to improve its shape. Study the plant carefully before cutting off all or part of a major branch. Use clippers to get a smooth cut, and make the cut just above a growth bud. The best times to prune a plant are when it is in active growth (usually in the spring) or soon after it has bloomed. Some plants such as true Palms have only one growth point and trimming the top will kill the plant. Containers Which is better a clay pot, a plastic pot, a ceramic pot, an undrained container, or a pot with drainage holes and a saucer? Many indoor gardens attribute the success of failure of their plants to the type of container used for growing! Instead, look to the type of potting mixture being used and your watering habits. 90% of plants having problems are due to the nature of the growing medium. Most commercial potting soils are too dense, tend to compact and inhibit new root growth. Instead of being concerned that a pot \u201cbreathes\u201d look for a loose porous potting mix that allows roots oxygen. (See above for more info) Plants grown in clay will need watering much more frequently. In winter you must be careful for clay pots conduct the cold and can chill the roots.

While most roses come in perfectly usable plastic pots, remember that black and other dark colored plastic containers will absorb heat and dry out the soil much more quickly than lighter colored pots.

Foreign packaging designs can be bright and fun, and the containers will not only look cheerful, but also rust and age in a very interesting way.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=e4ba1737-f53a-580a-83e6-7c7117bd16fc&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-1608wb-60-12906___2","_score":36.740494,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"Containers are also great when our soil is horrible for planting.

Well, consider these factors: A traditional class normally forces (or at least encourages) one to attend class in a physical space on a regular schedule - say, three days a week. An online course is typically (though not always)\"asynchronous,\" meaning one can log on to the class at their convenience. Thus, in an online environment, learning requires an added level of personal discipline. The temptation to procrastinate and catch up later is powerful, but must be resisted! A traditional class presents students with opportunities for real-time discussion, lectures from which notes can be taken, and an opportunity for immediate feedback from the instructor. Online classes almost always include\"threaded discussions\" which are conversations facilitated electronically within thelearning management system. The asynchronous nature of online learning means that you may not receive immediate feedback on your comments or questions. Thus, a student must regularly return to the course discussion board to remain engaged. You will find that the best online courses use other interactive tools - not just discussion boards - to build community and create a good conversation.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=2f65f0ac-6658-5e35-b844-9d5c01bbb150&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-1113wb-03-12384___1","_score":21.466301,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"Classroom

Throw too many punches, and the power of the punches and stamina decrease. Getting hit in the head does more damage than being hit in the body, and a kidney punch does more damage than a blow to the arm, making it less of a button masher and more of a realistic representation of boxing. More realism comes in the form of cuts and bruises, flying blood, and rag doll physics (which kick in with the knockout punch). More often than not you can keep hitting your opponent as they slide to the floor, and it's especially brutal if you've got them in the corner or on the ropes. There is a wealth of real life fighters from today and yesterday (including Roy Jones Jr., Lennox Lewis, Evander Holyfield, Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali), but if your favourite boxer isn't featured, the create-a-boxer feature is more than good enough to get you the fighter you're after.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=e6e54c98-dd7e-57dc-a9a2-1276df548cf4&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-1200tw-64-11545___189","_score":43.826294,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"\u201cI float like a butterfly and I sting like a bee?\u201d Yes, those are the words of one Mohammed Ali.

Children are more susceptible to foreign sounds than adults and adolescents, making them more capable of identifying and forming new sounds. Therefore, they tend to be more successful in the pronunciation of a new language.

In light of another discussion recently where a homeschool mother was requesting tips because she was going to write a book to help families figure out the perfect way to homeschool, this discussion resonated with me. Isn\u2019t the fact that homeschooled adults aren\u2019t perfect, likely related to the fact that most homeschooling families aren\u2019t perfect, because the members, including dad and mom aren\u2019t perfect? Ain\u2019t that a shocker to admit? While I personally don\u2019t know any homeschooled kids who have turned out so terribly bad, it stands to reason that with homeschooling families being a microcosm of our society in general, and individuals having free will, some homeschooled adults will choose things that go totally against the way they were raised. If we look around at the imperfect world we live in and all the pressures of the society we live in, we really can\u2019t be that surprised, can we? I think it\u2019s a fallacy for parents (homeschooling or not) to take credit for our adult children\u2019s successes or failures. We do the best we can in an imperfect world, to raise them with the values we cherish, and then they make their gradual way out into the world to make their own choices. Our hearts rejoice when they choose wisely and when life is good to them (sometimes as a direct result of their choices but sometimes no thanks to them) and we grieve and yearn over them when they don\u2019t choose wisely, or when life knocks them down again and again. However, much as we\u2019d like to take credit for their success, it\u2019s not really ours to own. And likewise, when our kids (adults, but yes, still our kids, in our hearts) choose horribly and end up in the ditch and either don\u2019t choose to or find themselves unable to crawl back out again, we really shouldn\u2019t beat ourselves up for it. I used to arrogantly think that when adult kids made rotten choices, their parents must have failed horribly in some way. But I don\u2019t believe that any more. That may be true in some cases, but it\u2019s been proven over and over and over to me that sometimes no matter how wonderfully kids are parented (and homeschooled) they don\u2019t always turn out that well. (And how many families do you know who have several children that turned out wonderfully well, and then there\u2019s that one that just turned out terrible? Same parents, same environment, different kid). . . .","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=d9b2235a-8666-5646-8ba5-32edfde23a92&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-1900tw-12-14840___4","_score":33.7686,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"Or better yet, let\u2019s not !

Unlike sugar, artificial sweeteners don't contribute to tooth decay. Possible health concerns with artificial sweeteners Artificial sweeteners have been the subject of intense scrutiny for decades. Critics of artificial sweeteners say that they cause a variety of health problems, including cancer. That's largely because of studies dating to the 1970s that linked saccharin to bladder cancer in laboratory rats. Because of those studies, saccharin once carried a warning label that it may be hazardous to your health. But according to the National Cancer Institute and other health agencies, there's no sound scientific evidence that any of the artificial sweeteners approved for use in the United States cause cancer or other serious health problems. And numerous research studies confirm that artificial sweeteners are generally safe in limited quantities, even for pregnant women. As a result of the newer studies, the warning label for saccharin was dropped.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=6b037425-07fa-5041-8a91-2ae0d9d909c2&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-1012wb-69-02875___5","_score":37.874454,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"Moderation Is Key For most people, eating natural sugar or using artificial sweeteners isn\u2019t going to cause big weight fluctuations or health problems.

However, this is an area of much more serious concern for diabetics. Unfortunately, simply using artificial sweeteners as an alternative is likely to be problematic for IBS. Artificial sweeteners in general can cause all sorts of gastrointestinal side effects, from gas and diarrhea to severe cramping. This is particularly true for sorbitol, which is the artificial sweetener most commonly used in commercial diabetic candies and cookies.

Artificials are not eating into the market too much,\u201d saidPhillip Hayes of The Sugar Association. Hayes pointed to a recent Harris poll on artificial sweeteners which showed three in five Americans believe they are somewhat or not at all safe. Common artificial sweeteners have very little name recognition, the poll found, so parents are unaware of what they\u2019re giving their children. For example, according to poll results, acesulfame k, the sweetener that the CSPI thinks should be off the market, is virtually unknown to parents. Only five percent of parents polled identified it correctly. The Sugar Association has petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to follow Canada\u2019s lead and clear up consumer confusion with front-of-package labeling for artificial sweeteners. As for concerns about calories, Hayes explains that a true teaspoon of sugar \u2013 not a heaping one -- has just fifteen calories that are easily burned off in sixteen minutes of sleep.

Make them a part of any dish - bake, grill, boil or fry. Chicken breasts are quite adaptable and can be used in variety of dishes, ranging from easy, quick, healthy recipes to exotic ones. Chicken breast is the leanest part of the chicken and is therefore healthier. However, chicken with the skin doubles the fat content. Hence, chicken is best skinned before cooking. Lean chicken breast has the least amount of fat, cholesterol and saturated fatty acids.

Whilst the choice of ingredients is very important, several cooking methods and preparation techniques can be used to reduce the fat content of dishes. 10.

To save money and ensure healthfulness, try making your own nuggets by cutting up chicken breast (without the skin), dipping chicken pieces in egg whites, and rolling in seasoned bread crumbs. Again, be sure to bake, not fry, to avoid unhealthy saturated fat. Kids like the appeal of bite-size pieces. Pair them with a salad full of bite size grape tomatoes, or serve healthier sweet potato fries (they do exist, just be sure to read the labels), and a yummy low-fat salad dressing.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=f83e931e-bb83-5bb7-bdfb-15380aa10599&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-1006wb-18-19405___2","_score":32.81427,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"Clean a few sweet potatoes with a vegetable scrubber (leave the skin on) and slice the potatoes into french fry strips the size of your choosing.

Many sources can be identified for off-flavors in cow milk and the same applies to goat milk: feeds (molasses, citrus pulp), forages (rape, rapeseed meal), weeds (onions, garlic), environmental odors (oil, gasoline, moldy rags, lime, cement, active bucks); normal physiology (early lactation colostrum, late lactation high salt contents, estrus, mastitis, sickness); improper handmilking procedures; improper equipment and handling (oxidation due to risers in milking pipelines, vacuum slips and searches, sun exposure, filthy clogged strainers and pipeline connections, unclean milking equipment, wash water not hot); slow air cooling instead of water cooling or refrigeration; variable temperature during storage, addition of warm milk to cold storage milk, transport in unrefrigerated containers, etc.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=b267c77a-74b0-5f5b-8336-e7d6428a7ca3&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0200tw-27-04260___1","_score":41.44283,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"Excellent article on benefits of goat milk - Nigerian Dwarf Dairy Goats Search Sign Up Sign In Nigerian Dwarf Dairy Goats for people who love the littlest dairy goats Main My Page Members Herd Names and Locations Photos Videos Forum Events Groups Blogs Donate Leaderboards All Discussions My Discussions Add Excellent article on benefits of goat milk Posted by Deborah Niemann-Boehle on February 15, 2012 at 7:32pm in Home Dairy View Discussions Just found this article and wanted to share it with everyone: http:\/\/www.mtcapra.com\/benefits-of-goat-milk-vs-cow-milk\/ This is the best explanation I've seen of how goat milk is better for humans than cow milk!

As philosophers have shown, perceptual experience remains one of the most intractable problems for a theory of the mind. However, philosophy of psychology has access to resources which potentially hold the possibility of moving beyond the kind of impasses that plague unaided philosophy of mind. Unlike the metaphysically oriented literature of the 1990s, the strategy for addressing the problem of consciousness in philosophy of psychology involves direct engagement with empirical investigation into the nature of attention and perception. Philosophy of psychology supplements and constrains a purely metaphysical or phenomenological approach to the problem of consciousness. Rather than taking our intuitions as the sole data for a discussion of the nature of conscious experience, philosophers of psychology have a substantial inventory of scientific evidence to draw upon.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=6f05441c-36f7-583f-93ed-160471cb669a&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0302wb-39-08414___5","_score":51.12832,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"In so doing, it also seeks to question, where appropriate,\u2026 more aboutWestern Psychological and Educational Theory in Diverse Contexts \u2026 The Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Psychology Edited by John Symons, and Paco Calvo.

Course Description This course will focus on experimental psychology from the perspective of a philosopher of science. Philosophy of science addresses such questions as (1) what is a science, (2) what is it to explain a phenomenon, (3) how do sciences change over time, and (4) what relations hold between sciences.

In summary, a random forest model is a good choice for model building for a number of reasons. First, just like decision trees, very little, if any, pre-processing of the data needs to be performed. The data does not need to be normalised and the approach is resiliant to outliers. Second, if we have many input variables, we generally do not need to do any variable selection before we begin model building. The random forest model builder is able to target the most useful variables. Thirdly, because many trees are built and there are two levels of randomness and each tree is effectively an independent model, the model builder tends not to overfit to the training dataset.

Random subspaces are a popular ensemble construction technique that improves the accuracy of weak classifiers. It has been shown, in different domains, that random subspaces combined with weak classifiers such as decision trees and nearest neighbor classifiers can provide an improvement in accuracy. In this paper, we apply the random subspace methodology to the 2-D face recognition task. The main goal of the paper is to see if the random subspace methodology can do as well, if not better, than the single classifier constructed on the tuned face space.

They derive their strength from two aspects: using random subsamples of the training data (as in bagging) and randomizing the algorithm for learning base-level classifiers (decision trees). The base-level algorithm randomly selects a subset of the features at each step of tree construction and chooses the best among these. We propose to use a combination of concepts used in bagging and random subspaces to achieve a similar effect. The latter randomly select a subset of the features at the start and use a deterministic version of the base-level algorithm (and is thus somewhat similar to the randomized version of the algorithm).","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=c8974384-77d2-501e-8348-a6a904fa03eb&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-1306wb-49-06042___18","_score":26.28326,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"This was done for a variety of classifiers such as Artificial Neural Networks[28], Random Forests [ 29], and SVM [30].

Hose lengths can be attached to extend the delivery of mulch up to 400 ft. Since mulch is delivered through hoses, the system will plug if the size of the wood fibers exceeds the tube size. It is therefore important that mulch be free of large pieces of wood.

These water sources are non-potable, and vary greatly in quality. Most of the on-site water resources have limited application, and are never suitable for human consumption. The following is a brief overview of such resources that may be available in both residential and non-residential settings. Rain Water Harvesting Probably the original alternate water source, rainwater harvesting dates back to pre-historic times in rudimentary forms. Some plants and animals use the practice to enhance survival. Desert plants, such as agave, form concave appendages to capture rain drops and direct the water towards the root zone. Porcine root out pits capturing rain water to form small ponds. By 300 B.C., the Nabataeans had already built miles of an elaborate rain water collection system and storage cisterns to supply water to their city of Petra, in what is now the country of Jordan. In whatever size and form, rainwater harvesting usually is one of the purest waters available of all the alternate water sources. Despite its imitial purity, rain water can be easily contaminated by: air-pollution; heavy metals and other toxins in roofing materials, paints, solvents, lead soldering, zinc coatings and adhesives; bird and rodent feces; and mosquitoes. It is never advised to use untreated rainwater for direct human consumption, though human have been consuming it for centuries with little documented ill-effects when precations are taken to prevent contamination. It is often advised for people to avoid prolonged skin contact, and be wary of the stored water becoming septic or a breeding place for mosquitoes and pathogens. It has also been observed that residents of home cisterns tend to be more tolerant of their own cistern water quality than visitors that imbibe in the cistern water.. Rain Barrels There is a growing trend of water utilities offering free or price-discounted pre-fabricated plastic rain barrels to residential customers. These barrels are connected to the downspouts of the home\u2019s roof gutters to collect the rain water from the roof. The rain barrels include a tap at the bottom of the barrel for users to attach garden hoses as a means to convey the water to landscape plants. (Rain water is superior to treated potable water for irrigating plants.) The barrels also have an overflow spout and hose to divert excess water away from the home\u2019s foundation.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=e95f9623-95f2-5ffe-9fee-4b9181a266dd&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0106wb-12-03296___31","_score":31.237577,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"Great website! :> +1 ... written by joe, June 01, 2011 okay everybody, distilled water costs A DOLLAR A GALLON, and rain water is FREE. how hard is it to buy one gallon, which will water your plant for well over a month, maybe even two? the time you spent on here asking about other types of water you could have spent getting the water recommended by every carnivorous plant website on the internet. everybody who asked about the different types of water are obviously unexperienced, so your plants are gonna die anyways. +3 can you buy distilled water written by Acidburn, July 16, 2011 i was wondering if you can buy distilled water? like in target store. will this be good or what do i do? http:\/\/www.target.com\/Market-P...primary_c olor-bin,target_com_size-bin,target_com_brand-bin&frombrowse=0","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=100306e7-1d9c-54a0-afaf-b58b49035acd&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-1203wb-56-39332___2","_score":31.186329,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"Close the taps well after use.

These hybrid diesel trains, already running on tracks in Japan and the United Kingdom, are getting people where they need to go while helping to keep the Earth green.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=63476ead-ef49-55a4-8915-76d2a98b3d96&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0406wb-68-04551___2","_score":79.039856,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"Contrary to the Japanese hybrid pioneers, European vehicle manufacturers have continued to depend on diesel technology and, in addition, have focused their research on fuel cell and hydrogen technologies.

Environmental Considerations There is a growing concern regarding the environmental implications of today\u2019s transportation options. Governments worldwide are inclined to reward businesses that opt for newer technology, such as hybrid engines and electric vehicles. However, the debate between diesel and gasoline engines as the more environmentally friendly option is unsettled.

As for autos, Ford, GM, and Daimler-Chryslereach built prototype diesel hybrids a few years ago which got mileage in the 70-80 mpg range.

There are many alternative models to explore for this, including \"co-routine\" styles of programming; methods for passing arguments and results between language interpreters executing in parallel; expressing the Swift task graph in an efficient, scalable, but easy-to-program-with data structure using the native language; conventions for mapping datasets and wrapping external application programs; and conventions for embedding simple snippets of Swift code into scripts in other languages. This project will entail selecting one language to experiment with (Python is preferred), implementing an experimental library interface to swift, and evaluating its usability, expressiveness, and performance on simple test cases and on a set of scientific applications.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=44e25b27-49ca-596a-8ccb-30c8ee164562&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0712wb-53-22135___1","_score":54.7343,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"Ghostweather R&D Blog: PyCon 2011 - Data, Men, and Me Ghostweather R&D Blog Interaction Design and Data Consulting.

The key point from that documentation is this: newline controls how universal newlines works (it only applies to text mode). It can beNone, '', '\\n', '\\r', and '\\r\\n'. It works as follows: On input, if newline is None, universal newlines mode is enabled. Lines in the input can end in'\\n', '\\r', or '\\r\\n', and these are translated into'\\n' before being returned to the caller.","uuid":"https:\/\/chatnoir.eu\/cache?uuid=f1c592de-c526-5459-8e61-20ddf2a1a2f2&index=cw12&raw&plain"}},{"_index":"raw_documents_url","_type":"_doc","_id":"clueweb12-0004wb-73-23813___9","_score":54.08037,"_ignored":["text.keyword"],"_source":{"text":"I also use a lot of Python and Beautiful Soup for manipulating data.
