i would say asp.net is a much better thing to learn especially if you want to be able to have skills that translate outside of web development.asp.net is usually written in c# or vb.net, and if you learn a language like c# then you will able to write many other things besides websites, like windows apps, iphone apps, android apps, windows phone apps, and not to mention linux/mac os x apps.asp.net is superior to php because php is a horrible language, but you can use good languages with asp.net, and there are mono implementations, and if they're good then windows licenses are not a problem.keep in mind that most web hosting companies do not allowed asp server pages, only php.okay tweet message: posting quick reply - please wait previous thread in it professionals' lounge forum timeline: help me to choose career path next thread in it professionals' lounge forum timeline: how to increase my website speed...there are *plenty* of windows/iis hosts also that support asp.net no problem.expand post » i am final year student of mca & doing my internship on phpexpand post » i am final year student of mca & doing my internship on php platform, but having interest in asp.net , can u plz guide me... similar threads pradeep_g - php email script through asp vsscript page?platform, but having interest in asp.net , can u plz guide me... similar threads php email script through asp vsscript page?andreret - yeah, most linux hosts.
