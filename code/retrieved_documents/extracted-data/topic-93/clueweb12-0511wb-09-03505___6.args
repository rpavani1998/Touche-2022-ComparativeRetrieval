after a couple of months there i started getting huge palm sized hives all over my torso.
i've read that for radiation carbon filters like brita and pur can help but they're not as effective as reverse osmosis filters.
especially since those tests don't cover everything.
i'm hoping that the soil filtration plus the brita water filter i'm using will be enough to keep it safe.

my well has a complicated filtration system on it itself as well for filtering out iron and other things, so i'm hoping all these things together (soil, well filter, brita filter) are giving me water that's at least as safe as berkeley tap water, which at last check is showing no detectable levels.
a brita filter doesnt remove jack squat.
further, we have found that the runoff is very much diluted relative to pure rain water so most of the reservoir water that comes from runoff is already diluted from soil filtering.
i'd never been allergic to anything except dust mites, and that was pretty mild compared to this.
i lived in north carolina once and the property had well water.
however, tap water is (e.g. from east bay mud) is normally pulled from the bottoms of large reservoirs in the sierra (this is not always the case) and travel through closed aqueducts to a treatment facility then pumped to tanks that feed the tap supply.

we had a well but only bathed in the water we didn't drink it.
we did do a radon test in the house inspection and the readings were average for the region.
i was later informed that the well could contain arsenic.
anywhow, i drank it and noticed a strange taste.
i hope so, since i already use one, but i do not know about it filtering out radiation.
the source is the reservoir has a dilution factor based on how much water inventory was there before the event and how much contaminated rain fell in the immediate area.

i have a tds meter and sometimes the tds rating is higher than from the tap when i test culligan or brita filters.
well water is normally drawn from ground water which seeps down the soil from rainfall.
that said, if the brawn team is interested in testing well water (and soil, too) from the sierra foothills, i'd be happy to provide samples.

i subsequently moved back to no cal for unrelated reasons but the hives stopped eventually.

i was really miserable and had to get steroid shots to clear them up.

despite the fact that the water passed the inspection test i just didn't feel comfortable drinking it.

so i'm gathering my well water is pretty safe to drink considering the filtration that takes place as the rainwater travels thru the soil, rocks, etc.

i'm on well water, too, and have been wondering the same thing.
further, we have found that the runoff is very much diluted relative to pure rain water so most of the reservoir water that comes from runoff is already diluted from soil filtering.
and i expect ground water supplies would have less contamination than just rain water run off.

i should add that for two years after i moved back my hair fell out.

when this whole fukushima thing went down i got curious about how far i've been living from nuclear reactors all my life.
that said, if the brawn team is interested in testing well water (and soil, too) from the sierra foothills, i'd be happy to provide samples.
we have found that the soil and rocks are an extremely good filter for these nuclides
any other info anyone else can provide would be greatly appreciated.
low and behold my north carolina home was within 20 miles of a nuclear plant.
i was later informed that the well could contain arsenic.
is well water more or less likely to be affected than regular tap water?‹ new cesium maps released by japan #radiation in japan: professor kosako: "come the harvest season in the fall, there will be a chaos" › a brita filter doesnt remove jack squat.

not hands full but more than a brush full every two days.

my doctor said it was "effluvium" and she, pardon the pun, brushed it off.

if you drink well water without ro + uv sanitizing you are making a huge mistake.
