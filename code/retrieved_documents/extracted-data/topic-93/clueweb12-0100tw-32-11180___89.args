having spent all summer last year clearing brambles, bindweed and couch grass, this year i've been dealing with the weeds that were dormant on the plot.
while i was sick in bed, my apricot tree arrived with three small blueberry bushes.
if you have any flower shrubs needing pruning at this time of year, tomorrow will be a good day to do it.
they are an indulgence wich will provide cut flowers for the house in the spring.
blacurrants need the oldest and weakest branches removed.
waning moons are good for harvesting and preserving.
a few jobs needed doing that were overdue with last month having been taken up with hypnotherapy, nursing a cold and christmas.
i'll be harvesting more potatoes, checking on the turnips and radishes i planted last month and starting a new compost heap.
this being a waning water moon, it was time to think of leaves.
at this time of year, although it's still warm in the house, the days are shorter.
so it was that despite the fact that the moon is waxing and root vegetables are best planted on waning moons, i planted some forgotten red onion sets.
also remember that plants with furry foliage are prone to rotting if their leaves are wet.
in fact, i did mix in compost that my partner got from the local recycling centre but as you can appreciate, with 125sq metres, i had to make it stretch a little.
the moon has still been in aries through the day and i would normally have been feeding my fruit.
february- 10:28 sunday 19th february waning moon in capricorn good day for weeding, attending to compost heaps plant out garlic that's been started in seedtrays sow carrots, parsnips indoors 10:28 sunday 19th
they are late but as they are winter hardy, i'm looking forward to harvesting them in the spring.
this is a new feeling for me but brought on by ritual of the harves and the laying in of stores.
half not believing what i was doing, i found myself getting up to bring them in from the garden.
the thing is that today is especially windy again and so this proved to be a challenging job.
actually, i found that i prefer them a little riper.
it's easy to think that the garden doesn't need watering in the winter but if you have pots with plants against walls, they may not be getting the rain.
suckers need to be removed as they drain the tree from its energy.
i am still off today, thankfully as i have pumpkins and more peas to put in.
now what's left is healthy and in great shape to see me through the winter.
if they reach the sky, i hope there isn't a giant up there!
11/05/11 next week, i'll be unable to attend to any gardening due to a very busy schedule.
i filled a bucket with comfrey leaves and then filled it with water.
happily the beds alloted for my onions, were already prepared a couple of months ago so there was no battle to be done with couch grass.
this is obvious as we can see its influence on the tides, which are higher.
i also planted salsify and some more red onions, which are late and i don't expect to harves before next spring.
the potatoes are more than ready to go in, having been chitted and i really don't think they could wait for the waning moon in capricorn.
if you have a fruit tree, chances are that it's grafted as this is done to provide a more vigorous or dwarf tree, depending on what's required.
2/08/11 with the moon in virgo, i've turned my attention to roots- actually my potatoes.
some also had rust on them.
in the meantime, i prepared a bed to plant the cauliflowers and purple sprouting broccoli tomorrow.
alternatively, you might find that when you pull on an old stem, there is a little shoot of a new plant attached to it.
so if i were to have a new year's resolution for the garden, it's to be far more clever and ruthless when it comes to the slimy brigade!!!
i also harvested the first lot of onions.
to this end, i spent the better part of yesterday afternoon digging a bed for them.
so i'm comforting myself in the knowledge that the earth is drinkingly deeply and keeping my fingers crossed for a break in the weather for the sake of my cauliflowers!
to do this, i'm going to simply cut the plant in half and pot up both pieces.
together with a few drops of lavender oil, i now have a gel in the freezer to help with burns.
so as the leaves start to develop, we need to at least part cover them with earth.
on monday, my day off, not much time was given to rest.
spring has been very dry here and the ground is hard.
i had planned to plant cauliflower and purple sprouting broccoli today but the recycling centre was out of compost and the clay soil on a newly dug bed is just too harsh for young seedlings.
pricking out seedlings is an act of real patience as rushing means delicate seedlings are lost.
alternatively, you might find that when you pull on an old stem, there is a little shoot of a new plant attached to it.
with the moon in scorpio, my thoughts turned to water and a good soak was delivered.
this is no longer the case and this means that they're no longer as sweet as they were.
beans and peas could use a boost too.
it means that watering and feeding is crucial, but it also makes for a longer growing season
in fact i spent 7 hours in total clearing the rest of my allotment.
what i didn't enjoy was the slugs, which believe that the plot is theirs in this weather.
all manner of jobs work out well during this moon, so i'm chancing putting in my potatoes, onions and shallots.
actually i'm looking at becoming more efficient in weed control next year so that they have less places to hide.
as  you have read, time and again i've written about my losing battle with slugs and snails.
9/05/11 this is going to be a busy day.
a second, albeit lesser crop is coming.
i also include herbal tea bags.
i'm looking at everything and thinking that i had better start winding things down before the frosts come.
like the sorrel, some of the leaves looked a bit tatty.
this is a sign of descending energy, so although the moon is still waxing, i felt it was good enough to plant the rest of my shallots and onions.
this is important as it will help air circulate between the plants and minimise the development and subsequent spreading of fungus.
i also tied back some floppy branches.
i harvested enough to make plenty of blackcurrant tonic.
it certainly felt abundant.
i planted more parsnips (very late due slugs devouring previous plantings), beetroot, carrots, celeriac and spring onions.
during this phase, the earth is more absorbant.
i meant to do that when the moon was last in leo but ran out of time.
you can grow bean sprouts, alfalfa and lettuce.
my fuchsias were hit hard by the winter.
31/01/12 one of the wonderful things about allotments is the fact that there's always someone on hand who can tell you what you need to know.
i find it hard to believe that we're not in for a shock, given the current summer weather.
i've been meaning to prick them out and put them in more comfortable quarters- that's bigger pots, since december.
but i'm constantly reminded of this by bindweed and bramble shoots poking out their heads all over.
the trouble is that salsify is not a common vegetable and no one has been able to tell me whether it's possible to store them in the same way that i store potatoes.
dill as my first batch succombed to scorching from the sun in the greenhouse which i forgot to ventilate.
yesterday, with the sunny weather, the old fragrance was back and so was the smell!
that is to say, it's too early for all the early summer crops and the winter crops are done.
i then cut back the comfrey once again and used its leaves to make another batch.
at least before freezing temperatures return.
i remember last year, planting onions one afternoon after work, being very cold and looking anxiously at a sky threatening to pour with rain.
i had hoped to have this covered and protected from the rain by the end of november but didn't get round to it.
the recent wet weather has made them more prone to rot
this is a sign of descending energy, so although the moon is still waxing, i felt it was good enough to plant the rest of my shallots and onions.
this being a waning water moon, it was time to think of leaves.
on monday, my day off, not much time was given to rest.
i got an early harvest from a few last week.
in fact i was surprised that they survived the previous winter's harsh spell.
as for my beans, well they're looking like i had jack's magic bean.
the recent wet weather has made them more prone to rot
with any luck this and a bit of sunshine should do the trick.
other seeds ripe for collection are those of my foxgloves and my hollyhocks.
this time i've put them somewhere safe- indoors and here they will remain until they are big enough to contend with molluscs!
i only have two more left ripening on the tree.
looking back, i remember accidently cutting back the flowers- no flowers, no seed.
the last of the apples were picked and tomatoes were also brought in.
they throw out what looks like a chord with baby strawberry plants on it.
now, we're enjoying a hot dry spell, we have a reprieve.
i decided to collect seed from my cornflowers and found that they had already self seeded.
my seed catalogue arrived today.
the tomatoes have been fed, as have the olives.
with the moon in libra, it's a good time to collect next year's flower seeds.
this moon is the only chance i have to deal with flowers while the moon is waxing this month, so although aquarius isn't the best gardening moon, i attended to my cauliflowers.
this means that it was my only chance this month to plant my tulip bulbs.
the abundance of strawberries means that there is enough to make strawberry jam.
this means that i took away dead leaves and noticed that i had some rust on other leaves.
then there is the rose garden which at this time of year is filled with scent.
she then looked at my gigantic compost heap and told me that much of it could be burnt.
this means that everything is soaked about once a week.
but happily the moon will still be waxing when it goes into libra next week.
well i knew the moon in leo was going to be busy...
they too deserved a feed.
if you've finished all your jobs for the moon in virgo, yesterday, today is a day to enjoy the garden.
and good stuff it is- soft crumbly and a rich dark colour for salsify, carrots, parsnips and other rooty delights.
this surprised me as i though it would be too wet.
i'm very excited about this as i've never had the space to grow flowers specifically for the house.
this is an earth sign so i focused on earthy matters.
there has been a big shift with the quality of my strawberries.
the moon was still waning in an air moon.
i picked some chamomile flowers, blended them together with oatmeal and put the mixture in a muslin bag.
i was wearing a rain coat and surprisingly enjoyed the experience as the rain was quite soft.
using clear plastic bottles with their bottoms cut off as miniature greenhouses has also been effective.
if they reach the sky, i hope there isn't a giant up there!
i think i'll be harvesting fennel.
so it's time to feed fruit like tomatoes, aubergines, cucumbers, peppers, courgettes, pumpkins and squashes.
the calendar will give a clue as to the reason for this burst of activity.
even my pets seem to have been more needy at this time of the month; and of course we know that some police forces have admitted to having more officers on duty at the time of the full moon because statistically they can see that there are more incidents aroud this time.
the hardest part is done.
the rain is keeping me off the allotment this morning but there is a little job that needs doing.
they will be weaker having produced so much fruit.
on the other hand, it might be time to tidy things up a little.
i didn't get the chance to cut its stems to crystallising but will try to do that when the moon is waning in aquarius as that will be a better time to do it anyway.
good job i had some time off this last week.
so i took advantage of the fact that the moon has been in scorpio today and watered the allotment.
12/05/11 last year i was too busy taming the jungle that was my overgrown allotment, to have time to attend to things like netting fruit.
this year's wonderful crop were self seeded.
4/06/11 yesterday morning the moon went into the sign of cancer and it will remain ther until around 4pm tomorrow.
so once the leaves have fallen, i'll need to cover them with clear plastic so that they don't get wet but still have light.
in the meantime, i prepared a bed to plant the cauliflowers and purple sprouting broccoli tomorrow.
if you don't you're leaving them exposed to the cold air coming in through the glass, especially if you don't have double glazing and you're depriving them of the heat in the room because the curtains act like a barrier.
if you have access to blackberries, enjoy them now.
2/10/11 the moon is still in sagittarius and today i continued my focus on fruit.
as much as i'm looking forward to the start of the growing season, there is such comfort in the slow pace of this season.
however as the moon is waning, the best job will be pruning.
2/12/11 with the days getting shorter, it's harder to get the time to be on the allotment.
at this time of year, seeds are still germinating and although the weeds have slowed down, there is still enough to keep me busy.
of course, i also picked strawberries.
i harvested enough to make plenty of blackcurrant tonic.
i'm very excited about this as i've never had the space to grow flowers specifically for the house.
you may wonder why, but that is because in high winds, it has been taking flight and landing in neighbouring allotments.
of course to do this, i need to ensure that the leaves are dry when i bring them in.
an easier job was the planting of sweet cicely.
i've been meaning to prick them out and put them in more comfortable quarters- that's bigger pots, since december.
interestingly, last year this didn't happen.
happily all of this exchanging of fruit happened on a fire moon.
i didn't deadhead my lilies earlier in the season and so they are producing seed.
today i harvested one that was more like a marrow.
february- 05:03 friday 17th february waning moon in sagittarius prune blackcurrant bushes and autumn raspberries.
the cherry and pear have finished so now they need feeding as they are in containers.
they throw out what looks like a chord with baby strawberry plants on it.
i think this is a waste and there is a better way of dealing with them.
water your house plants and any container plants in the garden that might be in need.
water too much and plants become dependant on water on the surface.
but i noticed while watering the other day that some potatoes were peeking up above the soil.
as it's a waxing moon in an air sign it's a good day to attend to flowers.
these are all indoors of course as it's still too cold at night for them to be out.
this is very exciting as i've never made compost before!
a very pleasant hour was spent and they're now comfortably sheltered in my mini-greenhouse.
this means that it's in a water sign on a waxing moon.
they grow in clumps of corms, similar to those of crocus.
i turned the material in my compost bin and was delighted to find that towards the bottom things are decomposing into something that will hopefully be fryable by next spring!
i've been picking the unaffected fruit and some are ripening on the window sill.
with all the rain we've been having, i'm not sure this will be possible.
as for the figs, i'm helping them to swell to a bigger size before they ripen.
i may be too late to prevent peach leaf curl later this season, but at least the blossom will be protected from future frosts.
so i've got them covered with mini cloches.
then there is the rose garden which at this time of year is filled with scent.
i'm going to feed my apples, strawberries, pear, peach and cherry trees.
a waxing moon in libra is perfect for sowing flower seeds, pricking out flower seedlings and planting flowers.
i also harvested more potatoes.
it's very large and in a container in the garden.
perhaps pruning could wait until next week when the moon's cycle will be further from the full moon.
just a bit of weeding and they settled in nicely.
air sign days are flower days, so my thoughts turned to the tulip bulbs which i found on the top shelf of my shed.
the seeds look very much like tomatoes, as they are from the same family.
happily the harvest has been very generous and although the weather has made a difference, the flavour is still good
as a biodynamic gardener, i'm supposed to make a special preparation and put it in a cow's horn to then bury it.
i'll be harvesting more potatoes, checking on the turnips and radishes i planted last month and starting a new compost heap.
so this year, i've decided to grow them in large containers in the garden again.
this way i can get a sense of how many plants are in the bed and i can thin out those that are too tightly packed.
my houseplants got a drink today and i was filled with pride when a client complemented me on their healthy appearance.
the same feed that i use for the camellia and magnolia should help.
this time i planted turnips, an oriental radish variety as well as more beetroot and carrots.
3/05/11 one of my compost bins has been sitting in the shed for about two months.
it's worth feeding the olives, i know that i get better results when i have done so in the past.
i then planned to plant them last month but last month, i had no time for gardening.
blackcurrants will be turned into a tonic and jam.
i have a plastic mini greenhouse which my partner has screwed to the back of my shed to stop it blowing away.
so i had to forget the clock ticking as i pricked out aquilegias, cauliflower, purple sprouting broccoli, statice, pinks, chamomile, alyssum, and borage.
it certainly felt abundant.
they are late but previous attention from slugs and snails have left me with one parsnip plant!
for this reason, i had to resow my leeks much later than i should.
this moon is the only chance i have to deal with flowers while the moon is waxing this month, so although aquarius isn't the best gardening moon, i attended to my cauliflowers.
one thing that has helped is that i've let grass grow over my paths.
potatoes, that is the tubers that we plant, need to be kept from light.
aries is a fire sign and so the focus was on fruit.
my partner went back to the recycling centre and brought bags of beautiful compost.
the mild weather has also brought on the start of blossom on my nectarine tree.
if it doesn't shed enough, then next month, while the moon is still waning in aries, i'll do some thinning myself.
5/11/11 those who read this blog on a regular basis will remember that this year, my biggest battle has been with slugs and snails.
i think that it may be that when it was in blossom we had some very bad windy and wet weather, so it's possible that there weren't as many insects around to pollinate fully.
as it's a waning moon though, there isn't much to do.
in fact one of them got so many plants from me that she's going to share them with her daughter.
the new canes are also quite tall now and needed staking.
thunderstorms yesterday evening meant that my potatoes had to wait until this morning to be planted.
the apple blossom is exquisite.
it feels as though summer has begun very early too.
last year they survived our coldest winter and the snow, so it's worth looking after them as they provide a ready supply of greens through the winter.
also when there were bowls in the fridge and  the fridge was opened, you were hit by the smell of strawberries.
thanks to them, my breakfasts continue to be delicious!
having spent all summer last year clearing brambles, bindweed and couch grass, this year i've been dealing with the weeds that were dormant on the plot.
so with the moon in aquarius, and it being a day to think about flowers, i turned my thoughts to spring.
you can already see the little peaches forming on it.
but happily the moon will still be waxing when it goes into libra next week.
3/02/12 a waxing moon in gemini means that it's a flower day, so this afternoon was all about cauliflowers.
if you're wondering how you can grow salad leaves in winter, then all you need is a window sill.
although pruning is normally done on a waning moon, this could easily become an uncontrollable thug so i pruned it today in the hope of reducing its vigour.
first job on the list is to water the garden, the houseplants and the allotment.
sadly for me, due to the fact that it's my second year on an allotment that had been abandoned for three years, weeding happens on a daily basis.
the rain is keeping me off the allotment this morning but there is a little job that needs doing.
these need protection, not from frost but from cold rain.
so it's lacking in something, probably iron.
they were given to me back in the summer and i haven't had the time to do much with them.
last year they didn't do very well on the allotment but that may be because they were growing next to some large cape gooseberries which meant that there was hardly any light available for them.
this year's crop looks a little thinner than last year's so i'm hoping the cherries will be bigger!
that means that this is a fruit day.
as a biodynamic gardener, i'm supposed to make a special preparation and put it in a cow's horn to then bury it.
the oldest of the heaps is about 7 months old and is taking up space which is very much needed for the planting of purple sprouting broccoli and cauliflower that i'm planning when the moon goes into libra.
the greatest disappointments were all due to losses brought about by voracious slugs and snails.
13/11/11 i haven't had any time for the allotment the last few days.
21/04/11 like most people, i've been cooped up indoors all day but am now looking forward to some time on the allotment.
this is useful as it encourages strong root growth.
i have never had blight there and have managed to pick tomatoes in november due to the shelter from the walls.
this is no longer the case and this means that they're no longer as sweet as they were.
happily the beds alloted for my onions, were already prepared a couple of months ago so there was no battle to be done with couch grass.
i fed the tomatoes, figs, olives, cucumbers and aubergines.
31/01/12 one of the wonderful things about allotments is the fact that there's always someone on hand who can tell you what you need to know.
i removed them and then earthed up the visible potatoes.
i was beginning to worry that it would collapse in the high winds and rain that we had in june.
so i'll be checking on my herbs.
last week was spent bringing in the last of the harvest.
the recent heat has stimulated my courgettes into very fast growth.
the mild weather so far has meant that they weren't killed by frost before i got to them.
as the moon is waning, there isn't much else to be done.
you could also divide the plant by simply putting a fork through the middle of it and then pulling the two plants apart.
i didn't deadhead my lilies earlier in the season and so they are producing seed.
my strawberries are threatening to take over my plot so i've been lifting runners and giving them to fellow allotment holders.
so i cut off the dead branches to allow the new life to come through.
the moon is in libra today and the sun is shining.
nevertheless, i did manage to get out into the garden to plant some basil and a lemon verbena.
time was not on my side as digging down a meter in some places is slow, gruelling work.
if they've finished when the moon goes into leo, i'll prune them then.
i sowed these seeds last year and they're now ready to plant in a border.
so today, i watered my house plants and took a walk in the countryside.
i now smell of tomatoes.
i have yet to net them, so they have had little protection from pigeons and cabbage white butterflies.
i wonder if they'll grow extra large having been planted on a moon jupiter conjunction!
that is to say, it's too early for all the early summer crops and the winter crops are done.
however, care is needed with young seedlings like peas and beans which do not yet have developed root systems.
the sauce can again be used with yoghurt and desserts as well as being frozen.
the ground is more absorbant during a waning moon, so this is a good time to water and feed.
they were over ten years old, so i guess they were more vulnerable.
so it was that last week, when the moon was in another earth sign, virgo, i found myself at a farm shop asking them whether their cattle had horns.
this is very exciting as i've never made compost before!
again, i'm thinking the harvest for both will just be delayed and as the packet of seeds' viability was only guaranteed for this year, i had nothing to lose.
waxing moons encourage fast growth and vigour which is why we deal with leaf vegetables and herbs on a waning moon.
so today, i'll water the house plants that need it and do some more tidying up.
a few jobs needed doing that were overdue with last month having been taken up with hypnotherapy, nursing a cold and christmas.
the bonus came when we were chatting about the season, and i told her about the loss of my pumpkins and squashes to the onslaught of slugs and snails.
actually with the colder mornings, this is very welcome and soothing.
this surprised me as i though it would be too wet.
today the moon is in sagittarius as i've been working i haven't been able to do much, and anyway it was raining.
waning moons are good for feeding as they ground is more absorbant.
planting will be done at a more ideal time.
summer fruiting raspberries fruit on the previous year's growth so they're best left at the moment or you'll lose next year's fruit.
my seed catalogue arrived today.
i've also noticed that my olive tree is in bloom.
lots of seed was sown, coriander, dill and other herbs as well as cabbage.
i'm going to feed my apples, strawberries, pear, peach and cherry trees.
6/08/11 with the moon still in scorpio, i have been watering and feeding my houseplants.
what i didn't enjoy was the slugs, which believe that the plot is theirs in this weather.
it's fine, they'll just be a little late.
8/06/11 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thc09ibcqf0 virgo is a very forgiving sign in the garden.
actually the important thing is also to remember not to put in cooked food, meat or dairy products as these would attract mice and rats.
there has been a big shift with the quality of my strawberries.
the cherry and pear have finished so now they need feeding as they are in containers.
quiet days in the garden are good days to do little jobs.
there is still a little daylight left, so if you haven't done it yet, there's still time.
2/10/11 the moon is still in sagittarius and today i continued my focus on fruit.
manolias and camellias develop their flower buds during august so it's important that they are fed and kept well watered during this period.
have a go and you'll be healthier throug the winter.
30/12/11 a bad migraine has kept me indoors since yesterday.
the moon is in leo, whilst still waning, i decided to cut back some of the foliage of my tomatoes.
the strawberries are slowing down now, but along with raspberries, there's still enough for breakfast.
the slugs and snails are thriving in this wet weather and of course they regard my plantings as their personal supermarket!
this means that everything is soaked about once a week.
libra is an air sign and air signs are linked with flowers, so today is a flower day.
so once again, i noticed that some of my raspberries have dead wood which i pruned out.
29/05/11 the moon went into taurus this afternoon and it was nice to have unlimited time on my allotment for a change.
more lettuce, coriander and cabbages.
the peach already has tiny peaches forming and this one has only just begun to wake from its winter slumber.
indeed this was the case, and they were absolutely delicious.
they are late but as they are winter hardy, i'm looking forward to harvesting them in the spring.
30/09/11 moon in scorpio is meant to be a good moon for dealing with pests.
using clear plastic bottles with their bottoms cut off as miniature greenhouses has also been effective.
she came and visited my site and i proudly showed her a cleared plot.
it seems counter-intuitive to bury a growing plant, but it it necessary.
one of my allotment neighbours gave me a clump of crocosmia crocosmiflora, otherwise known and monbretia.
it is possible to get nemetodes that predate on slugs.
this is not good news as when exposed to light, they go green which is poisonous.
on another note, i'm also going to plant a honeysuckle against my shed.
today's job was to get rid of the grass.
having said that, it clearly shows my unease over unseasonal weather, even though the sun is shining, with the weirdness of our weather, we could yet see frosts before june!
so today they were pricked out- planted into small pots and given some protection- as much from slugs as from the weather.
my compost heap has been so big that i'd had to start another one.
these need protection, not from frost but from cold rain.
i can look forward to a beautiful display in the containers in my garden.
as blackcurrants are rich in vitamin c, i freeze some of this tonic to have in winter and the smallest sign of colds.
so i cut off the dead branches to allow the new life to come through.
the perfect crop to sow today was cauliflower.
this will come in handy as it's likely that my store of onions will be dwindling by then.
flowers need a waxing moon which is what we'll have tomorrow.
so it was that despite the fact that the moon is waxing and root vegetables are best planted on waning moons, i planted some forgotten red onion sets.
they need acid soil so you need to ensure that what you feed is appropriate for them.
i thought about pricking out some carrot and fennel seedlings but decided to wait for the moon in capricorn as they still look quite young.
they have now been marinated in olive oil, a splash of vinegar, garlic, oregano and salt.
as this is my last chance to have these this year, i think it was worth getting out of bed.
21/01/12 a holiday and then the need to catch up with work have kept me off the allotment.
they don't develop deep roots which makes them more vulnerable during droughts.
if it doesn't shed enough, then next month, while the moon is still waning in aries, i'll do some thinning myself.
the latter were started off in trays and just need to be put into the ground.
being a water moon, and therefore a leaf day, i also planted some rhubarb, oregano and coriander today.
the same goes for all currants and gooseberries.
there are some suckers on my peach tree which need to be removed.
this morning i planted carrots, parsnips, beetroot and celeriac.
then you clear it again and more will germinate in time to clear a third time when the moon is in capricorn.
this is my third attempt at coriander this year, the slugs have had every plant so far.
being an earth sign, taurus meant that it was time to deal with root vegetables.
i want it to get bigger before planting it.
it's fine, they'll just be a little late.
instead it's porridge with apples and cinnamon.
it was like having a potting shed, but warmer.
autumn fruiting raspberries fruit on the current year's growth.
31/05/11 carrots and parsnips like soft, friable soil; soil that they can grow through without much resistance.
the sign associated with harvest, it is very helpful for biodymanic gardeners.
olives are too bitter to be eaten fresh.
those going in now will mean an earlier display.
i sowed the seeds last month and they're doing well.
when i get there on monday, i know i'll be enjoying how quiet and peaceful it all looks!
however, the moon is linked with the earth all the time, so its energy does affect us all the time.
29/05/11 the moon went into taurus this afternoon and it was nice to have unlimited time on my allotment for a change.
this is not the best time for planting leaf vegetables or herbs, so rather than spend time gardening, i went to the rhs gardens at wisley.
i sowed courgettes, french, borlotti and runner beans as well as pumpkins and cobnut squash.
3/02/12 a waxing moon in gemini means that it's a flower day, so this afternoon was all about cauliflowers.
these are beautiful, a much more simple version of gladioli.
other harvests were the green peppers and my first ever bunch of grapes!!!!
i've noticed that all my current bushes are now flowering and have decided that this will be a good day to net them to prevent bird damage.
in fact, i've resorted to bringing seedtrays in at night!
having been up late, i found myself at one in the morning remembering that plants hadn't been brought in.
june is the month when apple trees often shed excess fruit.
it was like having a potting shed, but warmer.
central heating can also be a problem for some plants, so check whether you need to spray them so as to increase humidity.
being rather a novice compost maker, yesterday with the moon in the earth sign of taurus, i invited my neighbour to come and look at my compost bin.
11/04/11 today is a good day to enjoy the garden.
20/07/11 rain, rain and more rain.
this is a fire sign and so there is a link with fruit.
air moons are flower days but as the moon was waning, i decided to wait for tomorrow to start planting.
the mild weather so far has meant that they weren't killed by frost before i got to them.
these are all indoors of course as it's still too cold at night for them to be out.
so it was that last week, when the moon was in another earth sign, virgo, i found myself at a farm shop asking them whether their cattle had horns.
at this time of year, although it's still warm in the house, the days are shorter.
before watering them on a water moon, i check whether they actually need it.
the allotment is still being enjoyed through the food i'm eating.
i'm also sowing some turnips.
27/10/11 with the moon in scorpio, the focus is on herbs and leaf vegetables.
also i noticed that they are producing seed.
with the moon in the earth sign of virgo, yesterday and today, the focus has been on compost.
everyone who ate them, loved them, but no one knew what a labour of love was sitting on their plate!
any fruit trees or shrubs which are either in blossom or which have flowered and are now forming fruit, now need a feed.
happily, today moon and time coincided so i spent a good part of the afternoon looking after them.
so i planted a few in pots also in the mini green house.
there have been a few surprises but none greater than the fact that i'm still picking strawberries and raspberries.
and so it was that each parsnip, due to its many contortions took twenty minutes to wash in the garden, be scrubbed in the kitchen and then finally cut, with all the little crevices cleaned.
the rule is that when the moon is waxing we deal with plants above ground, the exception being leaf vegetables.
i covered them with plastic bottles just to protect them until i have time to create a netted cage around them.
having said that, it clearly shows my unease over unseasonal weather, even though the sun is shining, with the weirdness of our weather, we could yet see frosts before june!
so i soaked the roots in a bucket to rehydrate it and then a couple of hours later, it was planted in a container.
with all the rain we've been having, i'm not sure this will be possible.
true to capricorn rather than having a lazy easter morning in bed, i was planting my potatoes.
as much as i'm looking forward to the start of the growing season, there is such comfort in the slow pace of this season.
i noticed my cucumbers are doing well and look forward to my first salad with them.
if you've missed this chance, don't worry, there is still plenty of time as you can sow the seeds in may.
tricky and fiddly but worth it if i'm to avoid peach leaf curl next year.
the only fruit trees that i'm still feeding are the olive and the fig tree.
perhaps pruning could wait until next week when the moon's cycle will be further from the full moon.
other sowings included hardy annual- statice and alyssum as well as hardy perennial- dianthus.
this morning i planted carrots, parsnips, beetroot and celeriac.
30/09/11 moon in scorpio is meant to be a good moon for dealing with pests.
picking them in the sunshine was heavenly.
i had some left over and put them on the allotment again, just in case we get an indian summer.
by then even the beans can be sown outdoors.
the most i've done is water the house plants.
i've also pricked out sunflowers, and the few larkspur and nicotiana seedlings left by the slugs!
it's been a very hot day, so i found myself watering everything very thoroughly again today.
in winter, root vegetables are muddy, especially if grown in clay!
if you are growing potatoes in containers, this is easy to do.
the new canes are also quite tall now and needed staking.
i've never grown this before but it is supposed to have lots of useful qualities which i look forward to experimenting with.
the beans i plan to blanche and then freeze.
the peach is still indoors and that needed a feed too.
yesterday with the moon in cancer, i sowed some chickory seeds and planted more spinach beet, swiss chard, lettuce and radiccio.
so tomatoes, cucumbers, aubergines, olives and figs have had some attention in between showers, doing a radio show and teaching today!
this year's crop looks a little thinner than last year's so i'm hoping the cherries will be bigger!
one of my very experienced allotment neighbours reassured me that if i did that now, they'd still be ok.
the lawned path along the avenue with herbacious borders on either side, gives you the opportunity to do just that.
so my beans and two more varieties of squashes went in.
as you have read, time and again i've written about my losing battle with slugs and snails.
i'm also planning to make a strawberry sauce that i could freeze and then use to flavour yoghurts, ice cream, cakes, etc.
the moon is in scorpio and this is a water sign.
indeed this was the case, and they were absolutely delicious.
i also sowed more parsnips, carrots, salsify, beetroot, celeriac and spring onions.
jackets are in the oven as i write.
it stands to reason that these could be sown now if we consider that annuals will be shedding their seed now to germinate in the spring.
today though, i took advantage of the fact that the moon is waning in an air sign.
winter signs, signs related to the time after the winter solstice and before the summer solstice are signs of ascending energy.
the link between water moons and leaves is due to the fact that the actual body of a plant is largely made up of water.
so time was spent tidying up and enjoying what's there.
so with the moon in aquarius, and it being a day to think about flowers, i turned my thoughts to spring.
it was still a fruit day as i made an apple tart for my students with apples harvested yesterday.
i have probably left them on the bush a bit longer than i should but i've been so busy with the strawberries that everything else had to wait.
as this is an air sign, it was a day for flowers.
the fight with the slugs is continuing and to avoid further losses of celeriac and parsnips i've been sowing in seed trays and waiting for the plants to be big enough to plant in the allotment.
the moon is still in pisces and it was so wet earlier that a fish might have had a good time!
the annoying thing is that my neighbour's currant bushes were left intact.
with the moon in capricorn, an earth sign, roots are the focus.
take care to only removed branches that have fruited or you'll reduce the fruit yield for later in the year.
in order to put this on the plot, i went to the centre of the allotment where wheelbarrows are kept and shared.
30/06/11 today's harvest was gooseberries.
this is not the best time for planting leaf vegetables or herbs, so rather than spend time gardening, i went to the rhs gardens at wisley.
being an earth moon, i spent time earthing up my potatoes.
with any luck we will get some more so all will be well for another week.
at least i know i won't be having to go out to harvest them in the wind and rain like last year.
i tried to water the allotment today but found that rodents had chewed through my hose pipe!
she came and visited my site and i proudly showed her a cleared plot.
growing them on the allotment made them prone to blight.
today with the moon in capricorn, i turned to look at my root vegetables.
on a much more cheerful note, the moon today is in sagittarius which means that it's a day for focusing on fruit.
the moon is still in taurus so it's a good day to tend to the compost.
i didn't manage to get everything done yesterday so today saw me spend a very long time on my allotment planting peas.
it's nice to be picking strawberries and raspberries in september, but the real stars of the month are the apples.
before watering them on a water moon, i check whether they actually need it.
if you pull and there is resistance, they are not yet fully ripe.
libra is an air sign and air signs are linked with flowers, so today is a flower day.
this of course has been due to the wet and cool summer.
one of my beds needed some attention, clearing weeds, etc.
having fallen out of love with cleaning parsnips, i determined that this year, things will be different.
many of you interested in organic gardening will be familiar with some of the principles placing emphasis on the health of the soil.
pricking out seedlings is an act of real patience as rushing means delicate seedlings are lost.
the strawberries are slowing down now, but along with raspberries, there's still enough for breakfast.
we can also feel its effect on us .
this enables the tree to concentrate its resources on the remaining fruit, producing bigger apples.
after putting the wheelbarrow away, i stopped to have a chat with the proud holders of a plot which is without a doubt the prettiest and best kept on the whole site.
the sauce can again be used with yoghurt and desserts as well as being frozen.
last year they didn't do very well on the allotment but that may be because they were growing next to some large cape gooseberries which meant that there was hardly any light available for them.
looking back, i remember accidently cutting back the flowers- no flowers, no seed.
every gardener i know has complained about their over-abundance this year.
although i'd have preferred to have done this job on a waxing moon, the fact that i was working with the roots of the plant, means that the plants can still benefit from the waning moon.
i diluted it about half the watering can to half water and proceeded to feed leaf vegetables and herbs.
if you have sorrel, tomorrow will be a good day to increase your supply.
the ground is very hard and so today for the first time, i've watered the garden and allotment.
seeds are not good news as the plant will then put all its energy into producing seed instead of continuing to grow and producing tubers (potatoes).
crop rotation is very necessary as it prevents a build up of pests and diseases associated with certain crops from building up in the soil.
a couple of weeks ago i was doing an intense hypnotherapy course which meant that there was no time for gardening.
in preparation for the moon in taurus tomorrow, and the planting of a new bed, my partner kindly got me some more compost from the recycling centre.
the tree is a bare root tree and it remained in its package until christmas eve.
the mild weather has also brought on the start of blossom on my nectarine tree.
these are simply wonderful and there are few pleasures that compare to walking barefoot on a cool lawn, on a hot summer's day!
water too much and plants become dependant on water on the surface.
it is possible to get nemetodes that predate on slugs.
the rest is enjoyed through the summer with yoghurt for breakfast.
i'm looking forward to some colder weather just so that i can feel that i'm on top of things.
one of them is so high that it's at eye level and looks very much like a wall!
so i had to forget the clock ticking as i pricked out aquilegias, cauliflower, purple sprouting broccoli, statice, pinks, chamomile, alyssum, and borage.
true to capricorn rather than having a lazy easter morning in bed, i was planting my potatoes.
a few of them will have strawberries descended from mine next year.
the moon is still in pisces and it was so wet earlier that a fish might have had a good time!
i'm also going to give my fig a new home today.
i was completely shattered but the efforts were very worthwhile as i can now just enjoy gardening without having to clear and dig!
although this appears like a good thing, actually they need thinning out.
although, virgo being a working sign, i'm sure you'll find something that needs doing.
i have been bringing young plants in at night and forgot.
i will leave it for a while and then when it is suitably stinky, it will provide a very nutritious feed for my plants.
together with a few drops of lavender oil, i now have a gel in the freezer to help with burns.
this way they are big enough to resist the attention of the pigeon population.
9 very heavy bags of "the good stuff" as one of my fellow allotment holders called it.
if they've finished when the moon goes into leo, i'll prune them then.
sweet corn, courgettes and peppers were planted on the allotment.
yesterday, with the sunny weather, the old fragrance was back and so was the smell!
seedlings in pots could also use a drink.
this means that i can have a continuous supply of peppermint tea next year.
if you have garlic that needs planting, today and tomorrow will be the right days for it.
also remember that plants with furry foliage are prone to rotting if their leaves are wet.
11/05/11 next week, i'll be unable to attend to any gardening due to a very busy schedule.
if that's a sign of things to come, i will be having a very good strawberry season indeed.
i think i'll be better at remembering to bring them in, in future.
last year, my priority was to tame the wilderness that was my allotment and plant it.
25/04/11 aquarius, is not a sign for gardening, so usually this is a moon for enjoying the garden.
i may be too late to prevent peach leaf curl later this season, but at least the blossom will be protected from future frosts.
slugs seem to love coriander.
i wasn't worried though as it's dormant, i knew it would survive a little while.
that is they grew into sizeable bushes and did flower but never actually set fruit.
when these touch the soil, they form roots.
i've also pricked out sunflowers, and the few larkspur and nicotiana seedlings left by the slugs!
this is not a difficult job, albeit fiddly because of having to provide steaks for each plant.
if you are growing them in the ground, it's easier to do it, if you have grown them in rows.
as it's a waxing moon, i also sowed some hollyhocks and foxgloves.
planting will be done at a more ideal time.
having been up late, i found myself at one in the morning remembering that plants hadn't been brought in.
the other difference is that during the sunny weather, i could smell them while i was working on the allotment.
but i figure that the worst that can happen is that i'll have some early onions next year.
the seeds look very much like tomatoes, as they are from the same family.
if it rains, i won't need to.
i diluted it about half the watering can to half water and proceeded to feed leaf vegetables and herbs.
this is enough time to take some cuttings from mint and peppermint.
the moon has been in aries today, but as it's waning, this is a quiet time in the garden.
a very simple, necessary and satisfying job that can be done even with a migraine.
i am also providing a gardening calendar each week so that you can plan your gardening week.
this is an air sign so it's a day for flowers.
6/08/11 with the moon still in scorpio, i have been watering and feeding my houseplants.
still, at least i'm not worrying about everything becoming overgrown, drying out or overcome with weeds.
i wonder if they'll grow extra large having been planted on a moon jupiter conjunction!
i didn't manage to get everything done yesterday so today saw me spend a very long time on my allotment planting peas.
3/05/11 one of my compost bins has been sitting in the shed for about two months.
this is not good news as when exposed to light, they go green which is poisonous.
but i'm constantly reminded of this by bindweed and bramble shoots poking out their heads all over.
they are making delicious apples tarts!!!
after teaching, i went over to the allotment and was given more squashes and courgettes by a friend.
they are now a small size but doing well.
i planted cabbages, swiss chard, spinach beat and celery.
it's quite a job as it covers about 2 square metres but very satisfying.
but she then told me that i could borrow her wheelbarrow and take all the burnable material to where she was creating a heap for a bonfire.
in fact, i did mix in compost that my partner got from the local recycling centre but as you can appreciate, with 125sq metres, i had to make it stretch a little.
they need to be measured so that i could create a kind of tent shelter around them.
last week i made apple sauce.
this time i planted turnips, an oriental radish variety as well as more beetroot and carrots.
the green ones are ripening on a widow sill.
it's worth feeding the olives, i know that i get better results when i have done so in the past.
autumn fruiting raspberries fruit on the current year's growth.
i do have a third just in case, but it would be really nice if they would leave this batch to me!!!
a waxing moon in libra is just right for planting flowers and at this time of year that means daffodils and hyacinths.
last year didn't work out for watermelons so my fingers are crossed this year!
if it rains, i won't need to.
anything that was prone to frost came in as there were a few very cold nights.
with today's moon in virgo, a sign most associated with detail, i created two fruit cages.
happily, today moon and time coincided so i spent a good part of the afternoon looking after them.
this is for the benefit of my plants not my dinner.
the bonus came when we were chatting about the season, and i told her about the loss of my pumpkins and squashes to the onslaught of slugs and snails.
if you pull and there is resistance, they are not yet fully ripe.
this is useful as it encourages strong root growth.
this is my third attempt at coriander this year, the slugs have had every plant so far.
and so it was that each parsnip, due to its many contortions took twenty minutes to wash in the garden, be scrubbed in the kitchen and then finally cut, with all the little crevices cleaned.
so today has been a day for watering the allotment, all container plants, seedlings and house plants.
the moon has been in aries today, so my attention was on fruit.
as for the olives, they're a bonus.
just as well, i found three snails munching through my parsnips and five on their way to young carrots!
my redcurrant bush was dripping with fruit and the bowl i brought for harvesting was really nowhere near enough.
8/06/11 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thc09ibcqf0 virgo is a very forgiving sign in the garden.
vegetables don’t come clean and prepared from the plot.
of late it's leaves have been losing their vivid green colour.
so today, it was gooseberry sauce and tomorrow it will be gooseberry jam.
12/02/12 snow, and another week of my intensitve hypnotherapy course have kept me off the allotment.
you can do this by roughly pulling outone of the stems, ensuring that there's a bit of root attached to it.
you know they are at their sweetest when you can pick them easily.
i'll start to feed it and keep my fingers crossed.
i gently carried him to the other compost heap and hope that he's busy devouring slugs!!!!
the moon is in capricorn so i'm turning my attention to potatoes today.
i sowed courgettes, french, borlotti and runner beans as well as pumpkins and cobnut squash.
this isn't ideal as it means that energy has gone into seed production rather than into the bulbs for next year's flowers.
these are easily grown in containers.
this is an air sign so it's a day for flowers.
the courgettes came in too.
with the moon in capricorn, an earth sign, roots are the focus.
if the smell is indicative of the good it will do them, they should thrive!!!
if you are growing them in the ground, it's easier to do it, if you have grown them in rows.
weeding around the lettuces and spinach beet has revealed that they are in great shape and that i'll soon be having great salads and stir fries.
yesterday with the moon in cancer, i sowed some chickory seeds and planted more spinach beet, swiss chard, lettuce and radiccio.
this is a water sign, so it's time to think about leaves and herbs.
so when the moon is in virgo, we can do things that we haven't had the chance to do because of very busy lives.
if you've missed this chance, don't worry, there is still plenty of time as you can sow the seeds in may.
rain had been expected but it didn't arrive and with young seedlings, and the heat, i didn't want to risk waiting to see if rain would arrive tonight.
actually, i found that i prefer them a little riper.
she then looked at my gigantic compost heap and told me that much of it could be burnt.
so today, i'll water the house plants that need it and do some more tidying up.
in addition to my usual blog about astrological events, on this page i am writing about my experiences as a biodynamic gardener in a special blog.
i find this to be the perfect time for them as by the spring, i have run out of onions.
low light levels are to blame.
happily, it all looks as though it's rotting nicely.
i won't be watering again until next week.
i fed the tomatoes, figs, olives, cucumbers and aubergines.
i've noticed a few small branches on my peach which are dead, so they'll be coming off.
the moon is now waxing so the shift will be to fruit and flowers for the next couple of weeks.
i had some left over and put them on the allotment again, just in case we get an indian summer.
today iraced to do some planting while the moon was still in pisces.
liquid seaweed or if you're close enough to collect seaweed, you can put it on your beds.
21/08/11 with the moon still in taurus, i continued to focus on root vegetables.
i have a plastic mini greenhouse which my partner has screwed to the back of my shed to stop it blowing away.
with the moon in a water sign, i decided to thin them in the hope that they will grow nice and fat in the early spring.
25/01/12 a waxing moon in pisces means that today is an easy day.
1/07/11 my gooseberries were wonderful and have been turned into a sauce which will be used to flavour cakes and desserts.
i've lost two, and i removed their twiggy remains; but i was very happy to notice new growth coming from the base of the third.
at least i know i won't be having to go out to harvest them in the wind and rain like last year.
however, the two that are on the allotment were beginning to show signs of stress.
but take care that you don't use too much  in one meal as it's it's high in oxalic acid.
so next year there are a variety of plans which mean that whatever the weather, life won't be so easy for the ravenous molluscs!
rain and work have continued to keep me away from the allotment but with the moon in leo, it's been about feeding my fruit.
dill as my first batch succombed to scorching from the sun in the greenhouse which i forgot to ventilate.
i ran out of time today but tomorrow the moon will still be in capricorn.
they came with couch grass attached.
these are beautiful, a much more simple version of gladioli.
it is still waning so it was a good day to cut back my comfrey and to make comfrey soup.
it's easy to think that the garden doesn't need watering in the winter
picking them in the sunshine was heavenly.
my mini greenhouse also need to to be prepared for the start of the growing season as it's about to get very busy indeed.
at this time of year, seeds are still germinating and although the weeds have slowed down, there is still enough to keep me busy.
that taught me the value of having some produce in store so that i don't have to go out everyday regardless of the weather.
there have been a few surprises but none greater than the fact that i'm still picking strawberries and raspberries.
the moon is in libra today and the sun is shining.
but it is also a good time to prune, and feed.
they were given to me back in the summer and i haven't had the time to do much with them.
suckers appear on the original root stock or trees that are grafted.
gemini is approaching the summer solstice so is considered to have descending energy.
the same goes for all currants and gooseberries.
it was still a fruit day as i made an apple tart for my students with apples harvested yesterday.
so wonderful to have a sunny afternoon as it's been rather gloomy lately.
so i have to keep it in check and then enjoy the fruit.
they need to be measured so that i could create a kind of tent shelter around them.
all manner of jobs work out well during this moon, so i'm chancing putting in my potatoes, onions and shallots.
so the job has been to clear up the dead leaves.
it feels nice to be storing for the harder times to come.
there are some last vestiges of summer as i'm still picking strawberries and raspberries.
rain and work have continued to keep me away from the allotment but with the moon in leo, it's been about feeding my fruit.
i sowed these seeds last year and they're now ready to plant in a border.
this week i'm making mincemeat for the mince pies and christmas pudding which will be made later in the autumn.
my fuchsias were hit hard by the winter.
this meant clearing the patch where it belonged of weeds, and then digging a small circle into which to push it and secure it.
if that's a sign of things to come, i will be having a very good strawberry season indeed.
any fruit trees or shrubs which are either in blossom or which have flowered and are now forming fruit, now need a feed.
given that i'm late, this could be a good thing.
this is the other reason why i love being on my allotment.
the moon has been in libra today so the focus has been on flowers and flowering vegetables.
so i knew i was just in time to make the most of a very young moon in an earth sign.
this one is bigger so i think i'm in with a chance.
so perfect for dealing with all fruit matters.
3/11/11 early spring often is holds a hungry gap.
so tomatoes, cucumbers, aubergines, olives and figs have had some attention in between showers, doing a radio show and teaching today!
a waxing moon in a fire sign means it's a planting day.
this means that i took away dead leaves and noticed that i had some rust on other leaves.
still it's all ready for the last of the potatoes which didn't get to go in last time.
the sun is shining again today.
i harvested more potatoes, some of which are massive.
now my original heap is smaller, and i know that i can burn more material from it.
so as the leaves start to develop, we need to at least part cover them with earth.
waning moons are good for pruning, so if there is any fruit pruning to be done, today and tomorrow are good days for it.
have a go and you'll be healthier throug the winter.
i'll need to keep the slugs off.
aries is a fire sign and so the focus was on fruit.
my breakfasts are changing, and reflecting the end of the season too.
at the moment, i'm harvesting soft fruit.
more potatoes were harvested and i've been drying basil for the winter.
happily though, this morning was delightfully sunny so i started to work on my tomatoes to ensure that they got as much exposure to the sun as possible.
these are painted with an arabic powder and rose water paste to be crystallised and used for cake decorations.
we've been getting a mix of sun and cloud everyday but they really need a few days of clear skies and sunshine!!!
coming home was less fun though as i had to dig over a large area of the allotment again in very hot sun.
as the moon is waning, there isn't much else to be done.
but everytime the moon was right, i was too busy and ran out of time.
i've planted broccoli, more aquilegias, statice and pinks.
if you have a fruit tree, chances are that it's grafted as this is done to provide a more vigorous or dwarf tree, depending on what's required.
so for example, garlic and onions should be planted on different beds each year.
i had planned to plant cauliflower and purple sprouting broccoli today but the recycling centre was out of compost and the clay soil on a newly dug bed is just too harsh for young seedlings.
i've lost two, and i removed their twiggy remains; but i was very happy to notice new growth coming from the base of the third.
i also sowed some more spring onion seeds.
the fact that the moon is in an air sign and waxing also made me think of my cauliflower seedlings.
i think it will be ok because the aim of chitting is for the potatoes to start developing buds and i think a waxing moon may actually speed this up.
if you have sorrel, tomorrow will be a good day to increase your supply.
and good stuff it is- soft crumbly and a rich dark colour for salsify, carrots, parsnips and other rooty delights.
the idea is that between the moon in capricorn and the moon in leo, seeds will have germinated.
the sun is shining again today.
thunderstorms yesterday evening meant that my potatoes had to wait until this morning to be planted.
the slugs and snails are thriving in this wet weather and of course they regard my plantings as their personal supermarket!
seedlings in pots could also use a drink.
it was lovely to be in the sunshine doing this.
take care to only removed branches that have fruited or you'll reduce the fruit yield for later in the year.
tomatoes, sweet pepper and okra, pea seedlings are looking big enough to be pricked out.
they would look around they said and let me know.
interestingly, last year this didn't happen.
then plant it and you'll find a new plant growing soon.
sweet corn, courgettes and peppers were planted on the allotment.
i planted more parsnips (very late due slugs devouring previous plantings), beetroot, carrots, celeriac and spring onions.
i'm also going to be sowing some annual seeds.
this means that i was planting in the rain.
i do have a third just in case, but it would be really nice if they would leave this batch to me!!!
i also planted salsify and some more red onions, which are late and i don't expect to harves before next spring.
i wasn't worried though as it's dormant, i knew it would survive a little while.
the tree is a bare root tree and it remained in its package until christmas eve.
my partner went back to the recycling centre and brought bags of beautiful compost.
it's quite a job as it covers about 2 square metres but very satisfying.
happily, it all looks as though it's rotting nicely.
they are doing really well with baby cucumbers already visible.
when i get there on monday, i know i'll be enjoying how quiet and peaceful it all looks!
this afternoon the moon will go into libra.
the currant bushes fruited well this year and needed a little attention.
lemongrass, and sweet marjoram for example can be sown now.
in the process some of the clumps of corms broke away, thus creating new plants.
the final push also meant that yesterday i was able to make use of the moon in a waxing fire sign (sagittarius) and finish planting all fruit.
a very pleasant hour was spent and they're now comfortably sheltered in my mini-greenhouse.
water moons are foliage days which means leaf vegetables like lettuce and herbs but it's a waxing moon, so there is not a lot to do.
if you're wondering how you can grow salad leaves in winter, then all you need is a window sill.
tulips are expensive but unreliable.
plants benefit from being in a nursery bed for a while as they have less competition than in border with lots of grown up and competing plants.
it too will feed the bees, and provide me with wonderful scent when i'm working.
i finally got the chance to plant my garlic.
i've been picking the unaffected fruit and some are ripening on the window sill.
i'm also going to be sowing some annual seeds.
i then planned to plant them last month but last month, i had no time for gardening.
but i missed a raspberry bush when i was pruning and it has some dead wood on it, so i'll attend to that today.
so as the moon is in taurus, (an earth sign), today is the day.
i've never grown this before but it is supposed to have lots of useful qualities which i look forward to experimenting with.
i'll also provide some for my cherry tree for the same reason.
15/07/11 the moon in capricorn is now waning so it's a good time to sow more carrots, beetroot and radishes.
my garden is small, but it is walled.
this is quite a tough plant that can withstand some rough treatment.
scorpio being a water sign, it's a day for dealing with leaf vegetables.
the allotment is still being enjoyed through the food i'm eating.
still it's all ready for the last of the potatoes which didn't get to go in last time.
at the moment, i'm harvesting soft fruit.
leo moons are a good time to do some weeding.
as the moon is in aries and is now waxing, this is a good day to attend to your fruit.
so for example, garlic and onions should be planted on different beds each year.
however as the moon is waning, the best job will be pruning.
first job on the list is to water the garden, the houseplants and the allotment.
i think that it may be that when it was in blossom we had some very bad windy and wet weather, so it's possible that there weren't as many insects around to pollinate fully.
so it's time to feed fruit like tomatoes, aubergines, cucumbers, peppers, courgettes, pumpkins and squashes.
i had hoped to have this covered and protected from the rain by the end of november but didn't get round to it.
this makes it easier to plan crop rotation.
the ground is very hard and so today for the first time, i've watered the garden and allotment.
it seems counter-intuitive to bury a growing plant, but it it necessary.
although last night i dreamt that i'd woken up to snow in july.
the rule is that when the moon is waxing we deal with plants above ground, the exception being leaf vegetables.
this is a fungus which affects fruit of this family causing leaves to distort and fall in summer.
i am still off today, thankfully as i have pumpkins and more peas to put in.
look out for it, the smell is simply delicious.
then i'll start to prepare the bed for the potatoes which will go in when the moon's in virgo.
this year's wonderful crop were self seeded.
i've noticed a few small branches on my peach which are dead, so they'll be coming off.
after teaching, i went over to the allotment and was given more squashes and courgettes by a friend.
more potatoes were harvested and i've been drying basil for the winter.
i love the way a little heat has brought everything on.
time was not on my side as digging down a meter in some places is slow, gruelling work.
i'm sowing more peas, beans, squashes and trying out watermelons too.
the recent heat has stimulated my courgettes into very fast growth.
with the moon in scorpio, my thoughts turned to water and a good soak was delivered.
you can plant them very deep and this increases their reliability, but i find the best thing to do is to lift the bulbs when the foliage has died down, store them in a dark and ventilated place, planting them in november or december.
although, virgo being a working sign, i'm sure you'll find something that needs doing.
this is the ideal day to do it as the waning moon will promote good root growth.
the prevents them from growing so fast that they bolt (produce flowers too quickly and go to seed).
the bonus yesterday was finding a tiny brown lizard.
suckers appear on the original root stock or trees that are grafted.
i didn't get the chance to cut its stems to crystallising but will try to do that when the moon is waning in aquarius as that will be a better time to do it anyway.
so i've watered again today.
when i was a teacher, children were always more hyper around the full moon.
also when there were bowls in the fridge and the fridge was opened, you were hit by the smell of strawberries.
then i'll start to prepare the bed for the potatoes which will go in when the moon's in virgo.
borage flowers were also picked.
but the moon in aquarius which is not a great moon for any gardening, has allowed me the time to plan the next few days to deal with surplus fruit.
last year i was too busy to do this and lost all my blackcurrants to the birds.
i dug them up and put them in the greenhouse.
they would look around they said and let me know.
sadly the clock's ticking meant that i didn't get to sow any of the seeds i wanted to sow today.
the rest is enjoyed through the summer with yoghurt for breakfast.
waning moons are good for feeding as they ground is more absorbant.
the beans are going strong too and there is that feeling of abundance we get just as we approach the end of summer.
today i also attended to something that got put off while i was sick.
this means that it was my only chance this month to plant my tulip bulbs.
but take care that you don't use too much in one meal as it's it's high in oxalic acid.
5/11/11 those who read this blog on a regular basis will remember that this year, my biggest battle has been with slugs and snails.
to do this, i removed all leaves that were stopping them from getting the sun.
it is still waning so it was a good day to cut back my comfrey and to make comfrey soup.
this meant that my parsnips in particular looked like something out of a parsnip horror movie!
more recycling, the rest will continue to rot down to create beautiful compost that will make the clay soil more friendly to young plants.
today with the moon in capricorn, i turned to look at my root vegetables.
last year i battled through wind, rain and mud to harvest in winter.
19/08/11 with the moon still in aries this morning, i continued to focus on fruit.
when these touch the soil, they form roots.
with a little protection from the worst of the winter weather, i should have at least one crop in the early spring.
i'm actually planning to be up before 7 tomorrow, on my day off so that i can have some time gardening before the rain!
as it's a waxing moon in an air sign it's a good day to attend to flowers.
they are an indulgence wich will provide cut flowers for the house in the spring.
with today's moon in virgo, a sign most associated with detail, i created two fruit cages.
but it is also a good time to prune, and feed.
as this is my last chance to have these this year, i think it was worth getting out of bed.
if it doesn't get this, you will get a very fat bulb without division into separate cloves.
as it's a waxing moon, i also sowed some hollyhocks and foxgloves.
normal tea has too much tannin which would acidify the compost.
21/08/11 with the moon still in taurus, i continued to focus on root vegetables.
so i've watered again today.
the potatoes are more than ready to go in, having been chitted and i really don't think they could wait for the waning moon in capricorn.
having fallen out of love with cleaning parsnips, i determined that this year, things will be different.
i decided not to prick out the seedlings i planted when the moon was in scorpio as they were too small.
in fact the idea is that if you're clearing land, you do so when the moon is in capricorn to start, then you do it again when the moon is in leo.
they were over ten years old, so i guess they were more vulnerable.
i dug them up and put them in the greenhouse.
i'm sowing more peas, beans, squashes and trying out watermelons too.
seeds are not good news as the plant will then put all its energy into producing seed instead of continuing to grow and producing tubers (potatoes).
waxing moons encourage fast growth and vigour which is why we deal with leaf vegetables and herbs on a waning moon.
one of my students kindly brought some woodash he's collected from his wood burning stove, so i can use that to feed the fruit on the allotment.
driving into the south east from wales, i became very aware of how parched everything looks compared to the west.
12/05/11 last year i was too busy taming the jungle that was my overgrown allotment, to have time to attend to things like netting fruit.
so if i were to have a new year's resolution for the garden, it's to be far more clever and ruthless when it comes to the slimy brigade!!!
actually the important thing is also to remember not to put in cooked food, meat or dairy products as these would attract mice and rats.
while i was sick in bed, my apricot tree arrived with three small blueberry bushes.
last year they survived our coldest winter and the snow, so it's worth looking after them as they provide a ready supply of greens through the winter.
i also planted more shallots and onions.
to do this, i'm going to simply cut the plant in half and pot up both pieces.
so it was that i found myself picking olives.
liquid seaweed or if you're close enough to collect seaweed, you can put it on your beds.
i then began to dig the new compost into the area.
it's a very cold day and a job like this doesn't involve a lot of movement.
as the moon is in aries and is now waxing, this is a good day to attend to your fruit.
central heating can also be a problem for some plants, so check whether you need to spray them so as to increase humidity.
so i'm planning to harvest all the peppers and the runner beans this coming week.
like a parent unwilling to give up on her unpromising child, i defended my misshapen parsnips on the grounds that looks don’t matter and that nobody would know what they looked like, once they’d been cut.
this meant that i had to spend rather a long time digging it out before planting.
i got an early harvest from a few last week.
the thing is that today is especially windy again and so this proved to be a challenging job.
also there are beans and squashes that need pricking out.
winter arrived early last year.
i was completely shattered but the efforts were very worthwhile as i can now just enjoy gardening without having to clear and dig!
this meant that my parsnips in particular looked like something out of a parsnip horror movie!
however, the beds in which i planted my peas were over-run with one of the many banes of an allotment holder' s life- couch grass.
specifically, i needed to check on my peach and nectarine trees.
however, the beds in which i planted my peas were over-run with one of the many banes of an allotment holder' s life- couch grass.
i weeded around them and applied a dressing of compost.
these are painted with an arabic powder and rose water paste to be crystallised and used for cake decorations.
whatever happens outside, nature just goes on oblivious to our madness.
as you might imagine transforming my plot from a wilderness into a well tended garden has created large compost heaps.
i removed them and then earthed up the visible potatoes.
fire moons are good for dealing with fruit and this is a waxing moon so good for planting.
it will also allow fruit to be more exposed to the sun during the ripening stage.
this is a job i normally do towards the end of september when i want them to ripen before the frosts.
my strawberry patch was a joy last year but plants were growing too close together by the end of the season.
aquarius is not the best sign for any gardening activity, but at the moment it is the only air sign in which the moon is in the waxing phase.
the link between water moons and leaves is due to the fact that the actual body of a plant is largely made up of water.
so as the moon is in taurus, (an earth sign), today is the day.
it's only because i have taken to covering it at night.
they've already decimated my first sowing.
this is enough time to take some cuttings from mint and peppermint.
so the potatoes have all been harvested which means that they are clean, safe from the attention of slugs, eelworm and easily accessable.
21/04/11 like most people, i've been cooped up indoors all day but am now looking forward to some time on the allotment.
the only fruit trees that i'm still feeding are the olive and the fig tree.
i turned the material in my compost bin and was delighted to find that towards the bottom things are decomposing into something that will hopefully be fryable by next spring!
it just goes to show what poor light levels we've had.
i noticed my cucumbers are doing well and look forward to my first salad with them.
last year my greatest success were the strawberries.
the currant bushes fruited well this year and needed a little attention.
this is because of the shorter days.
i'll be sowing more tomato seeds along with more peas.
aquarius is not a great day for gardening so it's a time to enjoy the garden.
thanks to them, my breakfasts continue to be delicious!
happily it did rain this morning, but not enough.
so today i'm pricking out last month's sowings.
so yesterday i began the process of removing any uncomposted material to add to the other heaps for further composting.
being a waning water moon means that the focus has been on leafy vegetables.
she also said that even if the tops go green, i could remove the green part and enjoy the rest safely.
so today i planted cabbages, lettuce, spinach beet, swiss chard, coriander, thyme and chamomile.
i don't think there will be any nectarines though as there is no blossom.
it's been a very hot day, so i found myself watering everything very thoroughly again today.
i planted cabbages, swiss chard, spinach beat and celery.
so it was that i picked the last of my runner beans, french beans and borlotti beans.
my garden is small, but it is walled.
this is a tricky operation as they are in pots.
virgo is the most useful sign for gardeners.
i'm also pricking out sweet corn and more tomatoes.
actually with the colder mornings, this is very welcome and soothing.
everyone who ate them, loved them, but no one knew what a labour of love was sitting on their plate!
ideally they'd be planted when the moon goes into gemini, but actually they're growing quickly and are desperate for more roomy pots.
my breakfasts are changing, and reflecting the end of the season too.
if you have garlic that needs planting, today and tomorrow will be the right days for it.
this is an earth sign so i focused on earthy matters.
you can also sow cress and lettuce that you can pick and eat while growing on the window sill.
the idea is that between the moon in capricorn and the moon in leo, seeds will have germinated.
it was a very satisfying thing to do a way of saying a big thank-you.
so in they will go, with my fingers firmly crossed.
there is still a little daylight left, so if you haven't done it yet, there's still time.
it was an opportunity to admire everyone's plots which look wonderful!
this is a fruit day.
being a water moon, and therefore a leaf day, i also planted some rhubarb, oregano and coriander today.
a waxing moon in libra is just right for planting flowers and at this time of year that means daffodils and hyacinths.
15/07/11 the moon in capricorn is now waning so it's a good time to sow more carrots, beetroot and radishes.
if you still have any potatoes in the ground, bring them in.
i also collected some marigolds to add to the gel from my aloe vera plant.
next, i saw to the tomatoes.
so a happy medium is needed.
9 very heavy bags of "the good stuff" as one of my fellow allotment holders called it.
if you do so, try to do it early in the day so that they aren't wet at night if the heating goes off.
yesterday it was rhubarb, oregano as mine died in the hard winter, and some coriander as slugs keep eating my seedlings.
remember that this includes flowering vegetables too.
i sowed the seeds last month and they're doing well.
so today has been a day for watering the allotment, all container plants, seedlings and house plants.
it is now january so you will notice that i am late.
sadly the clock's ticking meant that i didn't get to sow any of the seeds i wanted to sow today.
then i think i'll net some more of the fruit to keep the birds away.
i'll wait for the compost to come in and then plant them next week when the moon goes into libra.
replacements were promptly and generously offered as she said she had too many.
being a waning water moon means that the focus has been on leafy vegetables.
happily though, this morning was delightfully sunny so i started to work on my tomatoes to ensure that they got as much exposure to the sun as possible.
i'm also sowing some turnips.
this year's crop is mine.
4/06/11 yesterday morning the moon went into the sign of cancer and it will remain ther until around 4pm tomorrow.
with any luck this and a bit of sunshine should do the trick.
actually self sown nigella (love in a mist) are already in full bloom and looking lovely.
i covered them with plastic bottles just to protect them until i have time to create a netted cage around them.
the bonus yesterday was finding a tiny brown lizard.
however, during dry periods, i also water on waxing moons.
but the moon in aquarius which is not a great moon for any gardening, has allowed me the time to plan the next few days to deal with surplus fruit.
before the snow, i noticed that some of my pots outdoors were dry.
we became great friends and i felt connected with nature once again.
it feels nice to be storing for the harder times to come.
i have yet to net them, so they have had little protection from pigeons and cabbage white butterflies.
you may wonder why i haven't just sown the seed straight into the ground, but i haven't yet had much success with this due to the large slug population so the tried and trusted method is preferred.
manolias and camellias develop their flower buds during august so it's important that they are fed and kept well watered during this period.
this isn't ideal as it means that energy has gone into seed production rather than into the bulbs for next year's flowers.
the moon has been in aries today, so my attention was on fruit.
so i'm looking through the catalogues getting ready to order garlic and onions.
i then cut back the comfrey once again and used its leaves to make another batch.
other sowings included hardy annual- statice and alyssum as well as hardy perennial- dianthus.
it's one of the few places where we still find community spirit.
on the subject of tomatoes, at the rhs wisley gardens this afternoon, i noticed that their tomatoes were just beginning to ripen.
last year i was too busy to do this and lost all my blackcurrants to the birds.
in the meantime, today was spent preparing yet another bead for the all the planting that i'll be doing with the moon in leo.
i can't wait to pick the flowers and have that sweet scent in the house.
borage flowers were also picked.
this is the ideal day to do it as the waning moon will promote good root growth.
if it doesn't get this, you will get a very fat bulb without division into separate cloves.
this isn't a moon associated with gardening so i usually use this time for enjoying the garden, contemplating changes that need to be made or tidying up.
i'm still harvesting some strawberries but with less regularity.
i've planted them in a nursery bed on the allotment with a view to have some to cut and bring indoors, but also to then find room for them in the front garden.
the fact that the moon is in an air sign and waxing also made me think of my cauliflower seedlings.
i also spent some time looking after my cabbages.
as it's a waning moon, you might want to divide your herbacious perennials so as to increase your stock next year.
yesterday, my day off, was exceptionally busy!
february waning moon in scorpio sow some vegetables or herbs indoors, greenhouses or propagators.
in fact i was surprised that they survived the previous winter's harsh spell.
with a little protection from the worst of the winter weather, i should have at least one crop in the early spring.
well this is very necessary as i now have to stand on my tippy toes to reach the top which is above my head!
we've been getting a mix of sun and cloud everyday but they really need a few days of clear skies and sunshine!!!
tomorrow there will be more seed sowing.
in the meantime, i've been dealing with some of the harvest.
i decided not to prick out the seedlings i planted when the moon was in scorpio as they were too small.
i love the way a little heat has brought everything on.
potatoes, that is the tubers that we plant, need to be kept from light.
it also involves caring for the soil with the preparation of natural feed and ways of controlling pests.
whatever happens outside, nature just goes on oblivious to our madness.
it was lovely to be in the sunshine doing this.
this is not the best time to deal with fruit.
well the jungle is now tame enough for me to attend to details.
june is the month when apple trees often shed excess fruit.
i also tied back some floppy branches.
this is a water sign, so it's time to think about leaves and herbs.
one of them is so high that it's at eye level and looks very much like a wall!
then i think i'll net some more of the fruit to keep the birds away.
the moon is in capricorn so i'm turning my attention to potatoes today.
this is a new feeling for me but brought on by ritual of the harves and the laying in of stores.
this is a flower day, so my attention turned to my magnolia and camellia.
of course to do this, i need to ensure that the leaves are dry when i bring them in.
if like me, you are house bound, virgo is a good sign for planting.
if you have access to blackberries, enjoy them now.
i'm going to sow some on the allotment to ensure that there's a good supply of pollen for bees.
i tried to water the allotment today but found that rodents had chewed through my hose pipe!
they grow in clumps of corms, similar to those of crocus.
so i've now got them in big pots and as i clear it from other plants, they will have a dedicated space.
it's not a large crop, half a jar, but it's the largest ever and an unexpected bonus.
i harvested more potatoes, some of which are massive.
runners are the way in which strawberries propagate themselves.
24/05/11 being on holiday is wonderful, but coming home is always a delight for me.
although this appears like a good thing, actually they need thinning out.
this included purple sprouting broccoli and cauliflower.
but i noticed while watering the other day that some potatoes were peeking up above the soil.
consequently i was left with two gooseberries and a handful of redcurrants.
just look out for the next moon in leo, as it will be waxing in fire.
my thoughts have also been on composting.
so once again, i noticed that some of my raspberries have dead wood which i pruned out.
keeping on top of the weeds at this time of year is crucial.
but biodynamic preparations also have some links with homeopathic principles.
actually self sown nigella (love in a mist) are already in full bloom and looking lovely.
this will come in handy as it's likely that my store of onions will be dwindling by then.
water moons are foliage days which means leaf vegetables like lettuce and herbs but it's a waxing moon, so there is not a lot to do.
thankfully, with the moon in virgo there are many jobs which can be done.
tricky and fiddly but worth it if i'm to avoid peach leaf curl next year.
tomatoes, sweet pepper and okra, pea seedlings are looking big enough to be pricked out.
that is they grew into sizeable bushes and did flower but never actually set fruit.
so liquid feeds are best at this time.
so i'll prick them out today and put them in the mini-greenhouse.
in the meantime, i've been dealing with some of the harvest.
my redcurrant bush was dripping with fruit and the bowl i brought for harvesting was really nowhere near enough.
i've planted them in a nursery bed on the allotment with a view to have some to cut and bring indoors, but also to then find room for them in the front garden.
29/01/12 with the moon in aries, the focus has been on fruit.
so it was that i found myself picking olives.
they're looking big and healthy so should be able to cope with attention from the slug population.
i know what i like too and took advantage of the moon in gemini to plant some lavender and a couple of japonese anemones.
one of my allotment neighbours gave me a clump of crocosmia crocosmiflora, otherwise known and monbretia.
today the moon is in sagittarius as i've been working i haven't been able to do much, and anyway it was raining.
although last night i dreamt that i'd woken up to snow in july.
i've noticed that all my current bushes are now flowering and have decided that this will be a good day to net them to prevent bird damage.
happily the harvest has been very generous and although the weather has made a difference, the flavour is still good
if the smell is indicative of the good it will do them, they should thrive!!!
today though, i took advantage of the fact that the moon is waning in an air sign.
there are some last vestiges of summer as i'm still picking strawberries and raspberries.
happily all of this exchanging of fruit happened on a fire moon.
so i'm comforting myself in the knowledge that the earth is drinkingly deeply and keeping my fingers crossed for a break in the weather for the sake of my cauliflowers!
i was wearing a rain coat and surprisingly enjoyed the experience as the rain was quite soft.
this means that i can have a continuous supply of peppermint tea next year.
my houseplants got a drink today and i was filled with pride when a client complemented me on their healthy appearance.
my cherries are doing well but could use a feed.
for one thing, the garlic needs planting and today would have been the perfect day.
it is now january so you will notice that i am late.
i gently carried him to the other compost heap and hope that he's busy devouring slugs!!!!
so today is a day for reading seed catalogues.
i also fed other fruit like figs and the olives.
so i knew i was just in time to make the most of a very young moon in an earth sign.
aquarius is not a great day for gardening so it's a time to enjoy the garden.
winter signs, signs related to the time after the winter solstice and before the summer solstice are signs of ascending energy.
if like me, you are house bound, virgo is a good sign for planting.
it means that watering and feeding is crucial, but it also makes for a longer growing season
flowers need a waxing moon which is what we'll have tomorrow.
i don't think there will be any nectarines though as there is no blossom.
being an earth sign, taurus meant that it was time to deal with root vegetables.
26/08/11 rain and work have kept me from the allotment for the last few days.
i'm so delighted that my coriander has actually survived the slugs.
last year didn't work out for watermelons so my fingers are crossed this year!
today i also attended to something that got put off while i was sick.
if you are growing potatoes in containers, this is easy to do.
as for the figs, i'm helping them to swell to a bigger size before they ripen.
i'm also planning to make a strawberry sauce that i could freeze and then use to flavour yoghurts, ice cream, cakes, etc.
air sign days are flower days, so my thoughts turned to the tulip bulbs which i found on the top shelf of my shed.
look out for it, the smell is simply delicious.
last year my greatest success were the strawberries.
i think i'll sow some more french beans that will extend the season.
i also have a fig and a cranberry that need to be potted on.
if you like strawberries and have a little space for them, now is a great time of year to buy a few or ask a friend who has some to give you some runners.
remember that this includes flowering vegetables too.
this is for the benefit of my plants not my dinner.
the greatest disappointments were all due to losses brought about by voracious slugs and snails.
it's been a hot day and it was wonderful to be outdoors.
i'll wait for the compost to come in and then plant them next week when the moon goes into libra.
this is important as it will help air circulate between the plants and minimise the development and subsequent spreading of fungus.
they are fairly easy to store as long as they are kept cool and in the dark, otherwise they begin to go green which makes them poisonous.
she also said that even if the tops go green, i could remove the green part and enjoy the rest safely.
this way they are big enough to resist the attention of the pigeon population.
if you do so, try to do it early in the day so that they aren't wet at night if the heating goes off.
on the subject of tomatoes, at the rhs wisley gardens this afternoon, i noticed that their tomatoes were just beginning to ripen.
they're looking big and healthy so should be able to cope with attention from the slug population.
i weeded around them and applied a dressing of compost.
that means that this is a fruit day.
in fact the idea is that if you're clearing land, you do so when the moon is in capricorn to start, then you do it again when the moon is in leo.
2/08/11 with the moon in virgo, i've turned my attention to roots- actually my potatoes.
so this afternoon was spent dodging showers and pricking out lettuce, chervil, coriander, spinach beet and swiss chard, radicchio.
3/11/11 early spring often is holds a hungry gap.
coming home was less fun though as i had to dig over a large area of the allotment again in very hot sun.
i think i'll sow some more french beans that will extend the season.
it would be good to get some significant rain before the new moon.
if they peep above the ground, then they are exposed to the light andwill go green.
this is quite a tough plant that can withstand some rough treatment.
it's staying indoors for the winter to stop it from being exposed to cold rain as this will mean that it won't get peach tree wilt.
so this year, i've decided to grow them in large containers in the garden again.
garlic needs exposure to about three weeks of very cold weather, preferably with frost.
in the process some of the clumps of corms broke away, thus creating new plants.
it's a very easy way to propagate strawberries and at this time of year they are very busy multiplying.
one final tip- if you have plants on the windowsill, and you close the curtains at night, be sure to bring them into the room.
there is a great crop ready to be harvested and i'm just about to head out.
these are very large and growing in containers.
the peach is still indoors and that needed a feed too.
this isn't a moon associated with gardening so i usually use this time for enjoying the garden, contemplating changes that need to be made or tidying up.
the lawned path along the avenue with herbacious borders on either side, gives you the opportunity to do just that.
the moon has been in libra today so the focus has been on flowers and flowering vegetables.
the winds actually blew it over, but i've staked it now and it is still very statuesque.
this means that it's in a water sign on a waxing moon.
i think it will be ok because the aim of chitting is for the potatoes to start developing buds and i think a waxing moon may actually speed this up.
removing the leaves at this point doesn't worry me as i want the focus to shift from growth to ripening.
a few of them will have strawberries descended from mine next year.
the moon is in scorpio and this is a water sign.
so once the leaves have fallen, i'll need to cover them with clear plastic so that they don't get wet but still have light.
rain had been expected but it didn't arrive and with young seedlings, and the heat, i didn't want to risk waiting to see if rain would arrive tonight.
it was an opportunity to admire everyone's plots which look wonderful!
as it's a waning moon, you might want to divide your herbacious perennials so as to increase your stock next year.
it too will feed the bees, and provide me with wonderful scent when i'm working.
these may need watering more frequently if the weather is dry.
so i soaked the roots in a bucket to rehydrate it and then a couple of hours later, it was planted in a container.
to do this, i removed all leaves that were stopping them from getting the sun.
so next year there are a variety of plans which mean that whatever the weather, life won't be so easy for the ravenous molluscs!
cape gooseberries/ physallis, did very well last year.
13/01/11 more fruit went in today.
gemini is approaching the summer solstice so is considered to have descending energy.
half not believing what i was doing, i found myself getting up to bring them in from the garden.
it's not a large crop, half a jar, but it's the largest ever and an unexpected bonus.
with the moon in libra, it's a good time to collect next year's flower seeds.
so i decided to plant half in the green house with the cucumbers and the other half out on the allotment.
garlic needs exposure to about three weeks of very cold weather, preferably with frost.
with the moon in the earth sign of virgo, yesterday and today, the focus has been on compost.
these are easily grown in containers.
virgo is the most useful sign for gardeners.
so it's time to prune and feed.
we've had some rain in the south east at the weekend but not enough.
the good thing is that tomorrow the moon will still be waxing in libra, so if like me you didn't get the chance to work in the garden, there's always tomorrow.
you might enjoy a little video clip that was taken on tuesday when the moon was still in capricorn.
i find it hard to believe that we're not in for a shock, given the current summer weather.
so a happy medium is needed.
now what's left is healthy and in great shape to see me through the winter.
little seedlings cropping up all around their bed.
still, at least i'm not worrying about everything becoming overgrown, drying out or overcome with weeds.
i think i'll be harvesting fennel.
it's nice to still be sowing seeds at this time of year.
in the last few days with tensions running so high, i've taken refuge there.
so today i planted cabbages, lettuce, spinach beet, swiss chard, coriander, thyme and chamomile.
so i deadheaded my bulbs- tulips, daffodils, hyacinths and irises.
yesterday, my day off, was exceptionally busy!
now my original heap is smaller, and i know that i can burn more material from it.
this is a fungus which affects fruit of this family causing leaves to distort and fall in summer.
the heat in the last couple of days has changed everything.
so in they will go, with my fingers firmly crossed.
for this reason, i had to resow my leeks much later than i should.
1/06/11 today was a quiet day in gardening terms.
this way i can get a sense of how many plants are in the bed and i can thin out those that are too tightly packed.
so i planted a few in pots also in the mini green house.
in fact, i've resorted to bringing seedtrays in at night!
i finally got the chance to plant my garlic.
12/02/12 snow, and another week of my intensitve hypnotherapy course have kept me off the allotment.
this meant clearing the patch where it belonged of weeds, and then digging a small circle into which to push it and secure it.
but everytime the moon was right, i was too busy and ran out of time.
in the meantime, today was spent preparing yet another bead for the all the planting that i'll be doing with the moon in leo.
i say half, it sounds like large numbers but actually there were only four plants!
the fight with the slugs is continuing and to avoid further losses of celeriac and parsnips i've been sowing in seed trays and waiting for the plants to be big enough to plant in the allotment.
i think i'll be better at remembering to bring them in, in future.
it feels like summer and yet it's autumn and time to be planning for spring.
watering on waning water moons is usually enough if necessary.
so the waxing properties of the moon encourage growth above ground and the descending energy encourages healthy roots.
you may wonder why i haven't just sown the seed straight into the ground, but i haven't yet had much success with this due to the large slug population so the tried and trusted method is preferred.
a very simple, necessary and satisfying  job that can be done even with a migraine.
26/08/11 rain and work have kept me from the allotment for the last few days.
25/01/12 a waxing moon in pisces means that today is an easy day.
friday's heat was so welcome that my pumpkins actually started to change colour and ripen for the first time.
it feels like summer and yet it's autumn and time to be planning for spring.
water your house plants and any container plants in the garden that might be in need.
i find this to be the perfect time for them as by the spring, i have run out of onions.
1/05/11 as the moon is still waning and in aries, today i fed the cherry, pear, apple, peach, nectarine and plum trees.
if you don't you're leaving them exposed to the cold air coming in through the glass, especially if you don't have double glazing and you're depriving them of the heat in the room because the curtains act like a barrier.
on another note, i'm also going to plant a honeysuckle against my shed.
14/09/11 raspberries can be tricky to prune.
this means that house plants are not growing as actively as they might otherwise.
i left a bramble to grow on the edge of my plot so as to keep the delicious fruit, although of course i know for its sweetness, it's actually a thug with world domination as its aim.
to this end, i spent the better part of yesterday afternoon digging a bed for them.
jam, jellies, tonics, and sauces have been made.
it will also allow fruit to be more exposed to the sun during the ripening stage.
you can then cut the chord and you have a new plant.
i think my strawberries will be the first to be fed.
so i planted some aquilegias, also known as columbines.
i think this is a waste and there is a better way of dealing with them.
last year i was too late planting sweetcorn to get a good crop so again i'm really hoping things will be different this year.
but she then told me that i could borrow her wheelbarrow and take all the burnable material to where she was creating a heap for a bonfire.
today's job was to get rid of the grass.
my apple trees are laden with little apples.
with the moon in a water sign, i decided to thin them in the hope that they will grow nice and fat in the early spring.
they are doing really well with baby cucumbers already visible.
christmas got in the way last week.
this of course has been due to the wet and cool summer.
you may wonder why, but that is because in high winds, it has been taking flight and landing in neighbouring allotments.
normal tea has too much tannin which would acidify the compost.
so much to do that i'd better get started.
after putting the wheelbarrow away, i stopped to have a chat with the proud holders of a plot which is without a doubt the prettiest and best kept on the whole site.
so the potatoes have all been harvested which means that they are clean, safe from the attention of slugs, eelworm and easily accessable.
i'm going to harvest the seed to sow.
you can then cut the chord and you have a new plant.
the moon is now waxing so the shift will be to fruit and flowers for the next couple of weeks.
there is a great crop ready to be harvested and i'm just about to head out.
so i planted some aquilegias, also known as columbines.
i'll also provide some for my cherry tree for the same reason.
being rather a novice compost maker, yesterday with the moon in the earth sign of taurus, i invited my neighbour to come and look at my compost bin.
they then become poisonous.
waning moons are good for pruning, so if there is any fruit pruning to be done, today and tomorrow are good days for it.
i've planted broccoli, more aquilegias, statice and pinks.
so it's time to prune and feed.
19/08/11 with the moon still in aries this morning, i continued to focus on fruit.
this is not a difficult job, albeit fiddly because of having to provide steaks for each plant.
i also sowed some more spring onion seeds.
so today i'm pricking out last month's sowings.
25/04/11 aquarius, is not a sign for gardening, so usually this is a moon for enjoying the garden.
yesterday it was rhubarb, oregano as mine died in the hard winter, and some coriander as slugs keep eating my seedlings.
but if you have pots with plants against walls, they may not be getting the rain.
i can't wait to pick the flowers and have that sweet scent in the house.
in winter, root vegetables are muddy, especially if grown in clay!
now, we're enjoying a hot dry spell, we have a reprieve.
thankfully, with the moon in virgo there are many jobs which can be done.
i have been bringing young plants in at night and forgot.
other harvests were the green peppers and my first ever bunch of  grapes!!!!
tomatoes have blight due to the lack of sun and excess rain.
the last of the apples were picked and tomatoes were also brought in.
instead it's porridge with apples and cinnamon.
i also sowed more parsnips, carrots, salsify, beetroot, celeriac and spring onions.
today iraced to do some planting while the moon was still in pisces.
although it's better today, i've still needed quiet.
this is also the time to cut back autumn flowering raspberries.
last year i was too late planting sweetcorn to get a good crop so again i'm really hoping things will be different this year.
consequently, they need special care.
so today they were pricked out- planted into small pots and given some protection- as much from slugs as from the weather.
i'm still harvesting some strawberries but with less regularity.
i can never leave without a new addition for the garden.
this will then create potash which will feed my strawberry beds and apple trees.
in fact one of them got so many plants from me that she's going to share them with her daughter.
it's one of the few places where we still find community spirit.
plants benefit from being in a nursery bed for a while as they have less competition than in border with lots of grown up and competing plants.
you might enjoy a little video clip that was taken on tuesday when the moon was still in capricorn.
this means that house plants are not growing as actively as they might otherwise.
like a parent unwilling to give up on her unpromising child, i defended my misshapen parsnips on the grounds that looks don’t matter and that nobody would know what they looked like, once they’d been cut.
although we think of these as vegetables what we eat are the plants flowers.
this will then create potash which will feed my strawberry beds and apple trees.
removing the leaves at this point doesn't worry me as i want the focus to shift from growth to ripening.
i'm looking at everything and thinking that i had better start winding things down before the frosts come.
i have a half hour window to bring in the last of my potatoes.
the aubergines in the greenhouse are thriving with fruit developing well.
in the last few days with tensions running so high, i've taken refuge there.
these are very large and growing in containers.
you can already see the little peaches forming on it.
21/01/12 a holiday and then the need to catch up with work have kept me off the allotment.
driving into the south east from wales, i became very aware of how parched everything looks compared to the west.
i meant to do that when the moon was last in leo but ran out of time.
they don't develop deep roots which makes them more vulnerable during droughts.
i ran out of time today but tomorrow the moon will still be in capricorn.
2/12/11 with the days getting shorter, it's harder to get the time to be on the allotment.
we've had some rain in the south east at the weekend but not enough.
31/05/11 carrots and parsnips like soft, friable soil; soil that they can grow through without much resistance.
last year, my priority was to tame the wilderness that was my allotment and plant it.
13/11/11 i haven't had any time for the allotment the last few days.
i also spent some time looking after my cabbages.
today was much more pleasant.
so i've now got them in big pots and as i clear it from other plants, they will have a dedicated space.
this year's cherry harvest has been very limited compared to last year.
so today is a day for reading seed catalogues.
they will be weaker having produced so much fruit.
my compost heap has been so big that i'd had to start another one.
actually i'm looking at becoming more efficient in weed control next year so that they have less places to hide.
as for my beans, well they're looking like i had jack's magic bean.
i had even put my hosepipe away in the back of the shed.
the abundance of strawberries means that there is enough to make strawberry jam.
low light levels are to blame.
i have probably left them on the bush a bit longer than i should but i've been so busy with the strawberries that everything else had to wait.
this meant that my attempts to improve my sticky, clay soil were limited.
olives are too bitter to be eaten fresh.
so today, i watered my house plants and took a walk in the countryside.
they need acid soil so you need to ensure that what you feed is appropriate for them.
it's only because i have taken to covering it at night.
so i took advantage of the fact that the moon has been in scorpio today and watered the allotment.
this means that i was planting in the rain.
i'm also bringing in more of my herbs for drying.
in fact it wins awards every year.
actually, that will only happen if the rain stops.
we became great friends and i felt connected with nature once again.
i decided to collect seed from my cornflowers and found that they had already self seeded.
other seeds ripe for collection are those of my foxgloves and my hollyhocks.
this week i'm making mincemeat for the mince pies and christmas pudding which will be made later in the autumn.
the calendar will give a clue as to the reason for this burst of activity.
then you clear it again and more will germinate in time to clear a third time when the moon is in capricorn.
they are fairly easy to store as long as they are kept cool and in the dark, otherwise they begin to go green which makes them poisonous.
the most i've done is water the house plants.
so i'm planning to harvest all the peppers and the runner beans this coming week.
another windy afternoon, but the sun came out and it was very pleasant indeed.
if they peep above the ground, then they are exposed to the light andwill go green.
it's nice to be picking strawberries and raspberries in september, but the real stars of the month are the apples.
but planting my beans will have to wait as it's a waning moon.
for one thing, the garlic needs planting and today would have been the perfect day.
there are some suckers on my peach tree which need to be removed.
15/09/11 the moon has still been in aries through the day and i would normally have been feeding my fruit.
the winds actually blew it over, but i've staked it now and it is still very statuesque.
the sign associated with harvest, it is very helpful for biodymanic gardeners.
consequently, they need less water and i stop feeding them.
i will leave it for a while and then when it is suitably stinky, it will provide a very nutritious feed for my plants.
a couple of weeks ago i was doing an intense hypnotherapy course which meant that there was no time for gardening.
just as well, i found three snails munching through my parsnips and five on their way to young carrots!
tomatoes though seem to be slow to ripen this year.
you can do this by roughly pulling outone of the stems, ensuring that there's a bit of root attached to it.
indoors and here they will remain until they are big enough to contend with molluscs!
they taste sweeter like a cross between a melon and a grape.
it is waxing so it's not an ideal time for dealing with your root vegetables.
so all in all a quiet day in terms of gardening, but these days are just right for enjoyment!
so i deadheaded my bulbs- tulips, daffodils, hyacinths and irises.
by then even the beans can be sown outdoors.
crop rotation is very necessary as it prevents a build up of pests and diseases associated with certain crops from building up in the soil.
although i'd have preferred  to have done this job on a waxing moon, the fact that i was working with the roots of the plant, means that the plants can still benefit from the waning moon.
i'm actually planning to be up before 7 tomorrow, on my day off so that i can have some time gardening before the rain!
friday's heat was so welcome that my pumpkins actually started to change colour and ripen for the first time.
so yesterday i began the process of removing any uncomposted material to add to the other heaps for further composting.
the strawberries got a feed too as did the raspberries, the blueberries and cranberries.
replacements were promptly and generously offered as she said she had too many.
those going in now will mean an earlier display.
this one is bigger so i think i'm in with a chance.
i remember last year, planting onions one afternoon after work, being very cold and looking anxiously at a sky threatening to pour with rain.
i've also been checking the turnips and oriental radishes that i planted last month.
as you might imagine transforming my plot from a wilderness into a well tended garden has created large compost heaps.
i'm looking forward to some colder weather just so that i can feel that i'm on top of things.
this meant that i had to spend rather a long time digging it out before planting.
one thing that has helped is that i've let grass grow over my paths.
on a much more cheerful note, the moon today is in sagittarius which means that it's a day for focusing on fruit.
the peppers can ripen on the window sill.
this year's cherry harvest has been very limited compared to last year.
my cherries are doing well but could use a feed.
i did plant one outdoors though just to see how it does.
although pruning is normally done on a waning moon, this could easily become an uncontrollable thug so i pruned it today in the hope of reducing its vigour.
i'm now happier about my nectarine tree too.
the ground is more absorbant during a waning moon, so this is a good time to water and feed.
they have now been marinated in olive oil, a splash of vinegar, garlic, oregano and salt.
i'm so delighted that my coriander has actually survived the slugs.
nevertheless, i did manage to get out into the garden to plant some basil and a lemon verbena.
summer fruiting raspberries fruit on the previous year's growth so they're best left at the moment or you'll lose next year's fruit.
slugs seem to love coriander.
if you like strawberries and have a little space for them, now is a great time of year to buy a few or ask a friend who has some to give you some runners.
so perfect for dealing with all fruit matters.
the moon was still waning in an air moon.
as blackcurrants are rich in vitamin c, i freeze some of this tonic to have in winter and the smallest sign of colds.
then plant it and you'll find a new plant growing soon.
this is also the time to cut back autumn flowering raspberries.
in the meantime, i've started the new year eating figs from my small tree which is taking refuge from the winter indoors.
the moon has been in aries today, but as it's waning, this is a quiet time in the garden.
this made it an ideal day to sow flower seeds.
i think my strawberries will be the first to be fed.
but i figure that the worst that can happen is that i'll have some early onions next year.
this enables the tree to concentrate its resources on the remaining fruit, producing bigger apples.
my strawberry patch was a joy last year but plants were growing too close together by the end of the season.
if you have any flower shrubs needing pruning at this time of year, tomorrow will be a good day to do it.
1/07/11 my gooseberries were wonderful and have been turned into a sauce which will be used to flavour cakes and desserts.
so the waxing properties of the moon encourage growth above ground and the descending energy encourages healthy roots.
the other difference is that during the sunny weather, i could smell them while i was working on the allotment.
the moon is now waning in the sign of leo so it's time to do some pruning.
so when the moon is in virgo, we can do things that we haven't had the chance to do because of very busy lives.
you could also divide the plant by simply putting a fork through the middle of it and then pulling the two plants apart.
one of my very experienced allotment neighbours reassured me that if i did that now, they'd still be ok.
as for the olives, they're a bonus.
i can never leave without a new addition for the garden.
more recycling, the rest will continue to rot down to create beautiful compost that will make the clay soil more friendly to young plants.
i then began to dig the new compost into the area.
keeping on top of the weeds at this time of year is crucial.
anything that was prone to frost came in as there were a few very cold nights.
another windy afternoon, but the sun came out and it was very pleasant indeed.
this is a job i normally do towards the end of september when i want them to ripen before the frosts.
i was beginning to worry that it would collapse in the high winds and rain that we had in june.
this is ideal for putting in the bath but i like to use it to wash my face.
this time it was especially so as i returned to ripe strawberries.
the moon is now waning in the sign of leo so it's time to do some pruning.
i have never had blight there and have managed to pick tomatoes in november due to the shelter from the walls.
in order to put this on the plot, i went to the centre of the allotment where wheelbarrows are kept and shared.
it's staying indoors for the winter to stop it from being exposed to cold rain as this will mean that it won't get peach tree wilt.
this made it an ideal day to sow flower seeds.
my mini greenhouse also need to to be prepared for the start of the growing season as it's about to get very busy indeed.
in fact i spent 7 hours in total clearing the rest of my allotment.
air moons are flower days but as the moon was waning, i decided to wait for tomorrow to start planting.
the latter were started off in trays and just need to be put into the ground.
the perfect crop to sow today was cauliflower.
lots of seed was sown, coriander, dill and other herbs as well as cabbage.
last week was spent bringing in the last of the harvest.
i filled a bucket with comfrey leaves and then filled it with water.
i'll also be feeding my japanese laurel.
you can plant them very deep and this increases their reliability, but i find the best thing to do is to lift the bulbs when the foliage has died down, store them in a dark and ventilated place, planting them in november or december.
just look out for the next moon in leo, as it will be waxing in fire.
4/04/11 yesterday was the new moon so the moon is now waxing.
the beans are going strong too and there is that feeling of abundance we get just as we approach the end of summer.
my strawberries are threatening to take over my plot so i've been lifting runners and giving them to fellow allotment holders.
it would be good to get some significant rain before the new moon.
i will now wait for the waning moon in pisces to plant my new treasures.
so i decided to plant half in the green house with the cucumbers and the other half out on the allotment.
the moon is still in taurus so it's a good day to tend to the compost.
ideally they'd be planted when the moon goes into gemini, but actually they're growing quickly and are desperate for more roomy pots.
i thought about pricking out some carrot and fennel seedlings but decided to wait for the moon in capricorn as they still look quite young.
but i missed a raspberry bush when i was pruning and it has some dead wood on it, so i'll attend to that today.
at least before freezing temperatures return.
i did plant one outdoors though just to see how it does.
i've decided to keep growing my cucumbers in it, as they seem to do so well there.
this meant that my attempts to improve my sticky, clay soil were limited.
they then become poisonous.
this afternoon the moon will go into libra.
so i'm looking through the catalogues getting ready to order garlic and onions.
on the other hand, it might be time to tidy things up a little.
i'll start to feed it and keep my fingers crossed.
aquarius is not the best sign for any gardening activity, but at the moment it is the only air sign in which the moon is in the waxing phase.
again, i'm thinking the harvest for both will just be delayed and as the packet of seeds' viability was only guaranteed for this year, i had nothing to lose.
one of my students kindly brought some woodash he's collected from his wood burning stove, so i can use that to feed the fruit on the allotment.
before the snow, i noticed that some of my pots outdoors were dry.
so this afternoon was spent dodging showers and pricking out lettuce, chervil, coriander, spinach beet and swiss chard, radicchio.
so all in all a quiet day in terms of gardening, but these days are just right for enjoyment!
weeding around the lettuces and spinach beet has revealed that they are in great shape and that i'll soon be having great salads and stir fries.
a waxing moon in libra is perfect for sowing flower seeds, pricking out flower seedlings and planting flowers.
of late it's leaves have been losing their vivid green colour.
the final push also meant that yesterday i was able to make use of the moon in a waxing fire sign (sagittarius) and finish planting all fruit.
30/12/11 a bad migraine has kept me indoors since yesterday.
the oldest of the heaps is about 7 months old and is taking up space which is very much needed for the planting of purple sprouting broccoli and cauliflower that i'm planning when the moon goes into libra.
this is a way of gardening that takes into account the place of the moon when doing different tasks in the garden.
i can look forward to a beautiful display in the containers in my garden.
i've also been checking the turnips and oriental radishes that i planted last month.
waxing moon in taurus attend to any compost jobs necessary 13/02/12
however, care is needed with young seedlings like peas and beans which do not yet have developed root systems.
i will now wait for the waning moon in pisces to plant my new treasures.
actually, that will only happen if the rain stops.
so liquid feeds are best at this time.
tomatoes have blight due to the lack of sun and excess rain.
i left a bramble to grow on the edge of my plot so as to keep the delicious fruit, although of course i know for its sweetness, it's actually a thug with world domination as its aim.
jam, jellies, tonics, and sauces have been made.
in the meantime, i've started the new year eating figs from my small tree which is taking refuge from the winter indoors.
i know what i like too and took advantage of the moon in gemini to plant some lavender and a couple of japonese anemones.
it is waxing so it's not an ideal time for dealing with your root vegetables.
the prevents them from growing so fast that they bolt (produce flowers too quickly and go to seed).
it's a great alternative to spinach in soups, and sauces.
it's a very cold day and a job like this doesn't involve a lot of movement.
the beans i plan to blanche and then freeze.
if you still have any potatoes in the ground, bring them in.
that taught me the value of having some produce in store so that i don't have to go out everyday regardless of the weather.
so i'll prick them out today and put them in the mini-greenhouse.
they are late but previous attention from slugs and snails have left me with one parsnip plant!
one final tip- if you have plants on the windowsill, and you close the curtains at night, be sure to bring them into the room.
the moon is in leo, whilst still waning, i decided to cut back some of the foliage of my tomatoes.
i've decided to keep growing my cucumbers in it, as they seem to do so well there.
this is the other reason why i love being on my allotment.
these are simply wonderful and there are few pleasures that compare to walking barefoot on a cool lawn, on a hot summer's day!
like the sorrel, some of the leaves looked a bit tatty.
water moons are related to foliage plants and these are best delt with on a waning moon.
i'm going to sow some on the allotment to ensure that there's a good supply of pollen for bees.
the trouble is that salsify is not a common vegetable and no one has been able to tell me whether it's possible to store them in the same way that i store potatoes.
however, the two that are on the allotment were beginning to show signs of stress.
1/05/11 as the moon is still waning and in aries, today i fed the cherry, pear, apple, peach, nectarine and plum trees.
sadly for me, due to the fact that it's my second year on an allotment that had been abandoned for three years, weeding happens on a daily basis.
it's time consuming but at least it helps.
in fact it wins awards every year.
so it was that i picked the last of my runner beans, french beans and borlotti beans.
if you've finished all your jobs for the moon in virgo, yesterday, today is a day to enjoy the garden.
it stands to reason that these could be sown now if we consider that annuals will be shedding their seed now to germinate in the spring.
the aubergines in the greenhouse are thriving with fruit developing well.
it was a very satisfying thing to do a way of saying a big thank-you.
it's a very easy way to propagate strawberries and at this time of year they are very busy multiplying.
the annoying thing is that my neighbour's currant bushes were left intact.
the good thing is that tomorrow the moon will still be waxing in libra, so if like me you didn't get the chance to work in the garden, there's always tomorrow.
in preparation for the moon in taurus tomorrow, and the planting of a new bed, my partner kindly got me some more compost from the recycling centre.
the same feed that i use for the camellia and magnolia should help.
i picked some chamomile flowers, blended them together with oatmeal and put the mixture in a muslin bag.
this is a flower day, so my attention turned to my magnolia and camellia.
more lettuce, coriander and cabbages.
i say half, it sounds like large numbers but actually there were only four plants!
water moons are related to foliage plants and these are best delt with on a waning moon.
the strawberries got a feed too as did the raspberries, the blueberries and cranberries.
it's going to be a busy few days.
the peach already has tiny peaches forming and this one has only just begun to wake from its winter slumber.
fire moons are good for dealing with fruit and this is a waxing moon so good for planting.
