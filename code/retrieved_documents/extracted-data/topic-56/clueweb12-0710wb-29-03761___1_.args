safaris year round but best may to october safaris in east africa tanzania and kenya are east africa's most popular wildlife destinations and you'll find a host of expensive to cheap "safari packages" and "safari-beach combinations".africa's main safari regions are located in east and southern africa....we've done expeditionary trips since 2005 - better suited to seasoned travellers and available as guided set-date trips each season (speak to john, trish and chris)the only real alternative are some of the smaller and more exclusive private concessions..$ (south africa lacks the wilder nature of destinations up north).our "emerging destinations" include gabon, congo-brazzaville, car and cameroon.safaris in tanzania tanzania's "northern circuit": from arusha, includes tarangire, manyara, ngorongoro crater and the serengeti south and western tanzania: from arusha or dar es salaam, access into selous, ruaha or the western gems of katavi and mahale katavi and mahale: katavi is renowned for its outstanding resident game and lack of crowds; mahale is home to a healthy population of habituated chimps...but there's so much more zanzibar: stonetown and the eastern beaches are the obvious draw but if it's diving you want then go to mafia in tanzania - this crowd avoidance formula works easily in southern tanzania (particularly in ruaha and selous but better still in katavi and mahale between may and late october) during which time we also have some great beach combinations.we've partnered with specialists and offer both private and set date trips - 8000 climbs since 1993 with a 95% success rate....(speak to mark or jackie) - central africa:- semliki reserve: excellent for birding, its wild nature and lack of crowds destinations excluded from this part of our website.... - south africa is an ideal destination for extensions particularly from cape town, something that we do regularly.
