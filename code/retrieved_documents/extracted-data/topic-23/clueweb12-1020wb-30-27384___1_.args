we believe strongly in the concept of the disintermediation of media - i.e. eliminating the middleman between the content producer and the consumer.this approach works better for applications like finance, news, maps, and media.most people will love the concept of disintermediation as it extends to more and more content, but they won’t like the cold sterile approach google uses.it appears to me that their solution to everything is search, and that a white box that you type text into is the only thing that should separate a user from content.they do a fantastic job of monetizing this share, much better than yahoo or msn.google is fantastic at producing products that elicit the praise of the tech press and blog-jihadists.google holds a commanding lead in search queries with 45% share, compared with 30% for yahoo!it is far more application and service oriented.as the middleman is cut out of media, google will need to adjust their approach as people seek applications and services more like their previous couch potato experience.but the reality is - outside of search and advertising based search, google just doesn’t matter much.it also provided quantitative values that reinforced a suspicion of mine.i like the fact i can get movie reviews next to the showtimes.
