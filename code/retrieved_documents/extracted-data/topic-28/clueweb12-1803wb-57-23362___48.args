it needs the max but the airline also is put into an odd position in that it is likely faced with the following scenario:
electronic bleed air will be added to improve cabin pressurization (which is much like how the a350 will use bleed air)and better means more efficient fuel burn.
i’ll point out that the a320 aircraft started deliveries in the late 1980’s (1988) and several us airlines such as united own some of the oldest models.
they’ll also try to flog the a380 as much as possible and may even succeed with small orders in parts of the world it hasn’t penetrated much to date.
lufthansa did itself a favor and got rid of bmi and i expect they’ll continue their very conservative mangement of the airline and the subsidiary airlines.
the truth is, boeing will be happy to sell to o’leary and take his abuse while they do it.
enough so that they could buy them, operate them for a few years and sell them at a profit.
and a market glut of aircraft can result in depreciating demand for your new generation aircraft because the capital costs for current generation aircraft can become low enough to make sense for airlines to buy and use.
jal will take delivery of its 787s and find that they not only work well for jals needs but actually exceed expectations.
the dirty secret about that order is that lion isn’t an airline with significant risk both in operations and financially.

what those airlines have learned is that neither boeing nor airbus has a supply chain that can meet all their needs all of the time and on time.
had they not had to make that announcement, these new details would seem very much on time.
if there is one thing boeing knows, it’s that they cannot afford to damage their credibility with airlines further with a late arrival of the 737max.
they’re just not going to give away aircraft anymore and it appears that it will take o’leary a while longer to realize the position he and his airline are in.
mcdonnel douglas execs never could decide when to fight so ended up hardly ever fighting.
furthermore, airbus made some big promises for the a320neo
i strongly suspect we’ll see a metallic silver used with the current paint scheme over that.
at the end of the day, it’s about having a customer and earning money.
the financial crisis in europe will reduce some demand on oil but i see no real economic growth in any part of the world that will drive demand either.
they had a short extension to their usefulness but you will see these depart rapidly from us based fleets over the next 1 to 3 years.
mcnerney acknowledges that us airways hasn’t bought boeing in a some time and sees aa as a loyal boeing customer as well.
it may be named united but it is run by continental executives now and those executives have found ways to effectively use the 737 on their routes.
they are working very, very hard to bring as much advantage as possible to the single aisle wars with airbus.
initial orders will reflect some pent up demand to replace aircraft but it’s unlikely that the pace will continue in a sustained manner.
it’s clear that major boeing customers want to see something on the table.
the benefit in fuel savings on this order will take a while to be realized.
the airline with the most fuel efficient aircraft will see an advantage.
erj-140 and crj-200 aircraft are not going to be practical going forward.
airbus coo john leahy has actually come out and called for bombardier to cancel the airplane.
they’ve proven me wrong and i think the results are too good for them to not to continue over the next 12 months.
i also think that united and delta will be growing a bit more concerned about aa late in 2012 once they have a picture of what aa’s cost structures are likely to be.
if you can build if efficiently at current production rates (in the mid 30’s per month), you can figure out how to build it at a 60+ aircraft rate when that time comes.
however, what makes sense for aa doesn’t necessarily make sense for another airline.
all of that said, boeing is in danger of becoming a bit too secretive of its plans.
had they not had to make that announcement, these new details would seem very much on time.
not because airbus invaded the united states (they’ve already done that) but because aa would be regarded as one of boeing’s most solid customers.
they appear to be working very hard to make every gain possible against their competitors to bring even more to the table.

american airlines really does need a better fleet going forward and it cannot afford to wait until 2019/2020 to get started.
look for airlines to “upsize” their aircraft.
that’s why i honestly believe we’ll see a large order from southwest airlines for the 737max.
because aa already has a large 737 fleet.
i don’t think we’ll see much from the other regional airliners being developed.
this won’t be revealed a la one big announcement john leahy style.

united and delta made money.
it’s notable that even that aircraft got a better wing in the form of having raked wingtips a la 767-400er for longer duration, efficient flying.
my greater point is that you don’t win and you don’t grow as a company by playing “keep up” and playing it safe.
airlines will continue to make large orders for more fuel efficient narrow body aircraft.
southwest will start painting airtran aircraft in its colors and operating even more great deals to more places from atlanta
the real challenge in this aircraft is ensuring support and with boeing as a consultant, it may well have some help in that arena.
but that would require a fleet change that would take years to accomplish and with a320neo delivery positions reaching “unobtanium” levels for the next decade, the 737max probably does offer the best option given their position.
this is why you’re seeing fairly strong orders for the neo from existing airbus customers.
it would appear that airlines vocalized a desire for a new aircraft and ordered the re-engine like it was the best thing to happen since the concorde.
a good example of that last part is delta buying more and more md-90 aircraft.
right now, we don’t even know what the 737-re will be called and that’s kind of bad.
i don’t always sense that they’re defending the right things in the marketplace but, rather, defending their image against all comers.
again, these are 1970’s aircraft and while their amazing performance lent them a lease on life, they’ve become very expensive balanced against other aircraft that can perform 90%+ of the same missions.
the 737re doesn’t have board approval to offer . . .
filed under: airline fleets, airline news by ajax no comments » virgin america has announced a deal with cfm to supply the cfm leap56 engine for its airbus a320neo orders.
i do not think the pilots are going to cede that territory under the current contract or whatever agreement is made for the near future.
virgin america has horned in on american’s routes, frontier has struggled more and more under republic airways leadership and us airways still doesn’t have pilots or flight attendants integrated onto one seniority list.
boeing can’t afford to dither around much longer.
first, garuda is hardly a critical boeing network carrier.
airlines of that size can no longer afford to be an exclusive customer of one manufacturer or another.
finally, buying blocks of the a320neo and 737max will make an airline look smart.
the a321 will do a better job of fitting aa’s requirements for a boeing 757 replacement compared to the equivalent 737-900er.
the bravado always seems a little distasteful when you consider how airbus got where it was and, at the same time, i’m glad for airbus’ presence because it’s clear that it does motivate boeing to do better.
these are 1970’s design aircraft and with engines of similar caliber.
united will order a nice chunk of aircraft and i’ll bet that it will be an order similar in mix to the american airlines order from both airbus and boeing.
all in all, i think it will be a tough year for european airlines.
neither boeing nor airbus is interested in making such deals anymore and rightfully so.
offering that you couldn’t figure out how to immediately ramp up production to 40 to 60 aircraft a month is a somewhat lame excuse for backing away.
there is maneuvering room left with those fleets.
fuel costs will continue to be a difficult thing for airlines to manage.
because these changes add more risk to their ability to deliver this aircraft in 2017.
perception is as important as facts when it comes to whether or not an airline views your aircraft as leading edge.
they have a firm handle on the 787-9 development and i think they’ll find it within themselves to repeat that on the 787-10.
so far, they’re impressed but what they’ve seen of the 737max so far does not.
and they will get a good deal but gone are the days of getting a deal where you can buy a 737-800 and sell it in 3 years to *make* money on the sale.
but i would say that we now have reason 998 why boeing should, you know, get with the program.
at the end of the day, it’s about having a customer and earning money.
much like the new and improved a330 that airbus tried to sell many years ago didn’t fly either.
make no mistake, this really would be a very big loss for boeing.
instead, we learn at southwest airlines’ earnings call that they were kept in the loop and . . .
the mitsubishi mrj doesn’t feel quite right for airlines to me and doesn’t offer a growth path into a larger airliner.

because southwest is one hell of a good negotiator and recognizes that they have power in the simple fact that if southwest buys the aircraft, it’s an endorsement that everyone will pay attention to.

filed under: airline news by ajax no comments » 737max is getting real april 11, 2012 on 9:02 pm | in aircraft development | no comments boeing has revealed more details on its definition for the 737max now and one significant revelation is the decision to add 8 inches to the nose gear.
airlines of that size can no longer afford to be an exclusive customer of one manufacturer or another.
however, i do not think it will be similar in size.
the truth is, i think the airbus a320neo does fit ryanair’s needs a bit better these days.
expect virgin atlantic aircraft to start carrying some message against the iag deal for bmi.
their size (and the size of several competitors) demand manufacturing positions that can’t be serviced exclusively by one manufacturer.
with the announcement made on the a350-1000 (which would appear to more or less bring that aircraft into competitive range of the 777-300er but not exceed its capability), it’s time for boeing to bet again.
the capital costs are low compared to current boeing aircraft and the airliner provides close to current boeing efficiencies.
both know that some who have ordered both current and next generation aircraft aren’t necessarily going to be around to take delivery on those aircraft 5 years from now.
airbus needs to understand that it isn’t going to compete everywhere all of the time.
some perceive that boeing has been slow to release details and i understand that perception but the truth is that american airlines’ order last summer forced their hand into a premature announcement.
the truth is, aa is big enough to get preferred pricing and early slots regardless.
i think it’s possible that virgin america will make money in 2012 and i think it is really possible that we’ll all be pleasantly surprised by that.
it is thought that boeing will have a slight advantage that, according to many, will remain about 2% better than airbus.
it’s possible that the pratt & whitney engine may have more future potential but right now it also has a lot of risk associated with it.
moreover, i suspect that they would like to be let in on the discussions about what an airline *wants* in a new single aisle airliner / 737 replacement / 737 re-engine.
instead of making any real progress with its labor force, it decided to file bankruptcy but not before having made a historic order for aircraft from both airbus and boeing for the a320 and 737 series aircraft (with both a320, a320neo, 737 and 737max in the mix).
but the airlines makes a strong profit.
this, in some ways, smells like boeing trying to maintain the older airliner to use as an replacement for aging military aircraft such as what they’ve done with the 737 in creating the boeing p-8a poseidon (replacement for the venerable p-3).
the manufacturers think the neo and the max will garner enough orders to justify those production rates.
let’s look at the details first: the aircraft will begin arriving from both lines in 2013 and american airlines thinks it will have one of the youngest fleets in about 5 years.
in fact, i think it may well end up being the 737max-9 instead of the 737max-8.
that means an aircraft that receives enough modifications to handle the heavier cfm leap56 engine with a reduced fan diameter which should make the 737 models roughly equivalent to the airbus a320neo with about 2% cost efficiency advantages over the a320neo.
i do not expect to see another new airline show up and i think we may well see one true lcc depart the picture if things get particularly rough with respect to fuel prices or competition.
if it were to be a re engine strategy, it would have been far more encouraging to see boeing design a new wing or a modification to the wing to bring additional gains.
there are no more improvements and as fuel climbs, these aircraft become quickly unattractive even when completely paid for.
if aa manages to get a new pilot agreement that allows aa to subcontract its sub 150 seat flying, i’ll be rather shocked.
i wrote a long blog post early yesterday morning about american and the rumoured order it was about to make.
through this order and previous small orders, american airlines will have upguaged their entire fleet and particularly so in the next 5 to 7 years.
i have a feeling that boeing might be aiming higher.
if i were a boeing customer, i would imagine that my attitude towards boeing at this point would be quite similar to swa’s ceo gary kelly’s.
while ryanair says its dead serious about this aircraft, they conveniently do not rule out striking a deal with boeing or airbus on their aircraft and i would point out that china has yet to produce a viable commercial aircraft . . .
i dislike the bravado and somewhat cheap order tactics as well.
jetblue decided to fly more to the caribbean, entrench itself even more at jfk airport and blew it during an october snowstorm (again).
i also think that delta will decide its not afraid of southwest and it will decide to give southwest a taste of bullying it hasn’t experienced before.
richard branson actually didn’t make the news very often except to shout, stamp his feet and act insulted that virgin atlantic wasn’t able to do a deal to win bmi.
diversifying between manufacturers isn’t a bad idea anyway as it makes things just a bit more competitive and the airlines probably gains from that.
if o’leary and company wish to continue to operate a successful ulcc, they’ll be lining up to buy them as well because they do offer the kind of incremental gain in efficiency that is going to make the world’s legacy airlines much more competitive with ulcc’s like ryanair.
this was the tough choice engineering wise.
both know that some who have ordered both current and next generation aircraft aren’t necessarily going to be around to take delivery on those aircraft 5 years from now.
it’s a tall order and a difficult challenge for both manufacturers.
furthermore, it even gives boeing an “in” with the us airways executive team that it has not had for some time.
ryanair will back away from this aircraft quietly, i think.
they’re just not going to give away aircraft anymore and it appears that it will take o’leary a while longer to realize the position he and his airline are in.
presently, the smallest aircraft in its fleet will be the 737-800 or a320 at roughly 160 seats.
the truth is, i think the airbus a320neo does fit ryanair’s needs a bit better these days.
if they’re confident they can make a new airliner that is 20%+ better, make the bet and get going on it.
some airlines do desperately need newer, more economical airliners.
this is the first official mention of a 737 re-engine and i think we’re going to see some gnashing of teeth on the part of some airlines over the idea that a fresh design is likely 10+ years away.
there is no financial penalty for walking away from this except what aa might not get in preferred positions and pricing.
airlines want to know what boeing is going to do and waiting very much longer is likely going to result in either more orders for airbus or renegade orders to bombardier and embraer.
however, southwest knows that a new single aisle airliner will be available around 2025.

if o’leary and company wish to continue to operate a successful ulcc, they’ll be lining up to buy them as well because they do offer the kind of incremental gain in efficiency that is going to make the world’s legacy airlines much more competitive with ulcc’s like ryanair.
but it doesn’t mean md-90s (which use a far better engine).
right now, boeing can reach to the high 40’s without too much trouble.
the one thing it hasn’t done is announce major paper losses as a result of fuel hedging.
bombardier will work its tail off to sell more of the cseries and i think it may even succeed.
well, i wouldn’t be surprised if this was both a warning shot over the bow to boeing as well as a serious discussion.
that’s an aircraft that has run its course without something game changing.
i also think that gaining the latam membership is not nearly as “sure” as they think it is.
aircraft manufacturers don’t win over the long term with derivatives and i’ll point out that there have been a total of 9 major derivatives of the 737 with several sub-derivatives of those as aircraft as well.
they are almost all from existing airbus customers and from customers in areas where airbus and france have heavy influence.
we won’t see a need for production rates at 50 or more per month until a manufacturer gets off its duff and builds a new single aisle aircraft.
if it buys the 737-max, it will need to hold onto those aircraft for about 20 years.
that’s a lot of aircraft and it wasn’t that long ago when boeing and airbus could hardly find a buyer for the planes they were producing.
it needs this single aisle market for many reasons and the airlines are dissatisfied with boeing’s tentative approach to what it plans to offers airlines next.
europe: british airways managed to get through 2011 without any huge problems and saw willie walsh move up to the ceo position of international airlines group which means willie’s still in charge.
it does mean that we’ll see older aircraft from the 70’s and 80’s going away.
it’s not just an opportunity for southwest to succeed in atlanta but it is also an opportunity for delta to capture lost customers.
airlines need stable oil prices and, frankly, so do the world economies.
airbus has to get its act together on the a350 and try very, very hard to prevent too much schedule slip.
that said, i also think airbus is a bit reactive when it comes to competing.
(although one does wonder if they’re considering enough range / payload for the 787-10 given that airlines clearly enjoy the performance of late model 777-200er/lr aircraft.
it would have also been more encouraging to see a modification to the nose gear to permit a full on adoption of the cfm leap56 and, possibly, even the addition of a 2nd engine choice (pratt & whitney gtf).
but i also think that if any slots at jfk, lga, ewr, iad or dca come available for purchase, southwest will bid the cost of a boeing and lose again.
they want to extract as much value from those right now as possible because they know that as soon as they do introduce new airliners, those orders will change quickly.
airbus boxed boeing into this aircraft by introducing the a320neo.
american eagle has crj-700s that are configured from 63 to 65 seats and aa is currently scope clause limited on how many of these aircraft it can fly.
because fuel prices did not go up high enough for those fuel hedges to provide benefit.
airlines will continue to constrain their capacity and that will show more discipine than i thought they had 3 years ago.
the merged airline would, upon conclusion, have far more boeing aircraft and far more resources to service and operate boeing aircraft than airbus aircraft.
furthermore, both airlines have orders for airbus a320neo aircraft already.
that doesn’t mean that airlines with next generation 737s or airbus a320 series aircraft will be dumping their fleet for new aircraft.
south america latam got its approval from brazilian and chilean authorities (barely) and latam will begin consolidating its operations to make more money.
a good example of that last part is delta buying more and more md-90 aircraft.
it is thought that boeing will have a slight advantage that, according to many, will remain about 2% better than airbus.
in fact, i was a big advocate of fuel hedging not because of the windfall profits it provided many airlines for many years but, rather, because it really did make costs stable.
that leads us to another reason why that class of aircraft is needed.
north america: southwest airlines did its deal with airtran and bought itself an atlanta base of operations and some very valuable landing slots at northeastern airports.
o’leary, not surprisingly offers that anybody buying aircraft right now is nuts given the prices.
the 757 is entering into this territory as well.
if any orders come from the us, it will be years in the making.
i admire the gusto in which they present themselves and the entreprenurial spirit with which they approach their brand management with.
this order is about a marginal increase in capacity over time for most routes with the 757s leaving ever so slowly over time.
i would look for a sizeable portion to be 737-900er aircraft with some 737-800s.
the only way to offer early positions is to increase production even more.
airbus can’t build more even faster to meet the demand on the a320neo even with some airlines orders going away.
the dirty secret about that order is that lion isn’t an airline with significant risk both in operations and financially.
it is universally recognized that while oil prices may one day stabilize, they won’t return to $20/barrel.
when the market is flooded with those aircraft, the manufacturers have a much harder time selling customers into their newest and best.
these aircraft will be on operational leases and it appears aa didn’t have to put much money down for these firms orders (if any.)
so it doesn’t hurt for aa to talk to airbus.
i suspect that if doug parker is able to re-assure boeing over its existing aa orders, boeing will go neutral or even supportive of such a merger.
despite all the bravado, what we know is that both aircraft manufacturers pretty much compete evenly in the marketplace.
japan will find ana deploying more and more 787s on more and more routes with more and more success with that aircraft.
american needs better seat mile costs on its routes and it can achieve those because it can fill its aircraft with business passengers.
in fact, any worry about the 737max is kind of silly.
what delta is keeping isn’t nearly as old and inefficient as you think and the aircraft are far less capital expensive than new aircraft are.
this won’t be revealed a la one big announcement john leahy style.
the bombardier cseries does fit that whole very nicely and does it in harmony with this announced order.
ryanair got stunning prices for their original massive orders.
it might be time for more airlines to roll with the punches.
they wield enough buying power to make any aircraft manufacturer sit up and pay attention.
right now, we’re a long way away from seeing a sales leader in that aircraft category.
the md-80’s are departing and rightfully so.
airbus can’t build more even faster to meet the demand on the a320neo even with some airlines orders going away.
they’ll be the routes they are today and the routes we see developing even now.
i think american airlines will plod through its bankruptcy in 2012 with a bit of scandal here and there.
but that would require a fleet change that would take years to accomplish and with a320neo delivery positions reaching “unobtanium” levels for the next decade, the 737max probably does offer the best option given their position.

the truth is, boeing will be happy to sell to o’leary and take his abuse while they do it.
on the other hand, it’s notable that fuel hedging contributed significantly to their losses on paper.
now, aa has also announced that it will spin off american eagle soon and we’ll talk about that in a future post but that only means aa can (and will) access other regional airlines for its sub-100 seat flying.
this airline also flies from far less popular hubs, contracts with far less ideal regional airlines and has far fewer international flights and even if it could fly more international routes, it lacks the equipment to do so.
he even gets to land a traditional boeing customer (garuda international) but at the risk of sounding anti-airbus and pro-boeing, there is a bit more to this story in my opinion.
i think we’ll see a largish order from latam and it will be for an airliner to replace aircraft on both the brazilian and chilean side of the airline.
airlines put off buying large quantities of aircraft for quite a long time and now the legacy airlines not only want them, they need them.
well, for the committed airbus customer, going deep on the a320neo isn’t quite as foolish because it is fairly obvious that airbus *won’t* have a replacement for the a320neo as soon as 2025.
mcnerney acknowledges that us airways hasn’t bought boeing in a some time and sees aa as a loyal boeing customer as well.
airbus’ introduction of the neo made it much more imperative to deliver more efficiency now rather than a decade later.
it needs replacement aircraft for the remaining 737-300/500 aircraft in the fleet and that is being achieved with 737-800s (which replace 737-700s which then replace 737-300/500 aircraft.)
i don’t see a real strong suitor for frontier except, perhaps, jetblue but since frontier isn’t based at jfk airport, i do wonder at jetblue interest in an airline like frontier.
take the bombardier cseries vs airbus a319neo scenario that is unfolding.
when you have a competitive environment, customers change from time to time.
one example is that the 737 already has winglets (aka “sharklets” on the a320).
fuel price volatility will continue to be a problem.
right now, it needs the 737-800 and it needs it now rather than later.
the bombardier cseries presents just a touch too much threat in the future.
but with the decision made, i also have to credit boeing for appearing to have decided to go all in.

it would have been a difficult challenge but it is one that boeing is in position to achieve.
on the one hand, airbus coo john leahy gets to make good on his prediction of 500+ committments to the a320neo by the paris air show.
in fact, it presently is the only airliner that does.
the truth is that the emerging economies are largely dependent upon demand from both europe and north america and neither of those economies will see high growth in 2012.
i firmly believe that boeing was leaning towards a new aircraft but also needed time and space to get where it needed to be with that aircraft.
airbus need to work hard getting their current production sold until their aircraft are in place but without depreciating values and without massive discounts to encourage orders.
some perceive that boeing has been slow to release details and i understand that perception but the truth is that american airlines’ order last summer forced their hand into a premature announcement.
i think we’ll see capacity restraint for another year and higher air fares than seen in a long, long time.
filed under: airline news by ajax 2 comments » richard aboulafia of the teal group has criticized boeing and airbus plans to ramp up production on their single aisle airliners and the man has a strong point.
and bombardier is making the aircraft.
instead, he’ll suggest stripper poles could be installed on ryanair aircraft.
boeing will be biding its time on improvements to the 777 until it sees more definition of the a350-1000 and it will throw its resources into ramping up 787 production, 787-9 development and 737max development.
somehow, i severely doubt that a boeing led by someone such as alan mulally would have adopted such a strategy.
the 737-800 is a good fit as a md-80 replacement but not as a 757 replacement.
airbus would struggle with that without making a much larger investment in a new line (such as in the united states.)
if aa had a fully modern fleet now, it’s likely it would not have lost money this past quarter.
i think it will be a partial fleet replacement with lots of options for incremental change in the fleet.
that’s the airliner that it really needs to go deep on.
milwaukee will become the regional airport it was intended to be instead of a bloody battleground between lcc airlines.
as much as boeing and airbus would like to think so, they don’t.
it will maintain a large fleet of nextgen 737s for the next 10 years or more.
southwest has a fairly new, fairly efficient fleet of 737s and it will want to keep buying new aircraft, too.
and a market glut of aircraft can result in depreciating demand for your new generation aircraft because the capital costs for current generation aircraft can become low enough to make sense for airlines to buy and use.
if it does succeed, that success will begin in europe as well as for airlines of lesser developed areas such as the middle east, india and the far east.
the aircraft cannot be polished like its 737 counterparts.
they are working very, very hard to bring as much advantage as possible to the single aisle wars with airbus.
i actually think that virgin atlantic will have to find an airline alliance to join and if i’m right, i would lay very heavy odds on it being the star alliance.
if there is one thing boeing knows, it’s that they cannot afford to damage their credibility with airlines further with a late arrival of the 737max.  this is not an all new aircraft with all new materials and airlines will expect it on time or early.
if this happens, oneworld and american airlines gets kicked in the groin in south america.
in fact, airlines are being much more prudent in their orders by ordering a few here and a few there to just keep pace with their conservative needs.
this might be good for aa, it isn’t good, necessarily for southwest airlines or ryanair.
the financial crisis on that continent will make it very hard to earn an honest profit and middle eastern airlines will continue to erode the long haul traffic that european airlines have enjoyed for decades.
it didn’t need quite as many 737s.
airlines haven’t been able to plan their costs very effectively for the past 3 years.
boeing will simply add more and more substantiation to their claims as they continue discussions with airlines.
well, for one, the cost to announce this order was tiny compared to a traditional order.
one thing is sure, the comac 919 isn’t going to deliver what ryanair needs and certainly not on time.
airbus execus fight like bulldogs even when someone just happens to walk nearby.
the sweet spot its lineup offers will become more attractive to airlines once they see bombardier actually perform in the development and test of this aircraft.
i do think the a321neo will be the 757-ish replacement and i do not think that aa will upsize aircraft to the 737-900er down the line.
i suspect that if doug parker is able to re-assure boeing over its existing aa orders, boeing will go neutral or even supportive of such a merger.
while i don’t expect quite the same delay as the 787 saw, it will be a significant delay and it will impact airbus.
however, this is a pretty big loss for boeing in the psychological warfare arena of aircraft sales.
airbus managed a coup by forcing boeing’s hand and scaring them away from a new design.
sooner or later, ryanair will have to make a move on a next generation 737max or a320neo.
it’s westernized, it’s flying and it does feel like its the right size.
first, it is time to stop behaving like a teenager in this rivalry that exists with boeing.
i think its labor force is about to take a beating on wages and benefits and i think the resulting bitterness will last for years.
as if that wasn’t enough, it made a firm deal on a bunch of 737max aircraft and agreed to take on even more 737-800 aircraft for its routes.
for 2012, more explosions and more governmental heads will push even deeper into the sand.
there is absolutely, positively, no question that boeing needs to get back in the game asap.
this has credence due to the fact that united has about 200 aircraft that are some of the oldest around (these are 757s and 737s mostly from the original united airlines) and those aircraft are likely having a real impact on the bottom line as a result of fuel costs and maintenance.
neither works for mainline service very well because they’re heavy for the number of passengers they carry and their range just isn’t needed for routes requiring those passenger numbers.
i think we’ll see an order and i suspect that order may well go all to boeing.
this only makes sense as the gains are more than enough to justify the purchases and now is the time to gain an advantage in bargaining with both boeing and airbus.
southwest will get its deal and boeing needs southwest to stamp approval on the max.
current demand isn’t from growth, it’s simply from the need to replace aging airliners and the thoughts of ramping up production to 50+ per month does smack of hubris.
however, their arj21 is a non-starter since it is heavy and, you know, no one has really ordered it except chinese airlines who were told to order it.
the sukhoi superjet, on the other hand, has a real chance, i think.
airbus has pitted its a319neo against the cs300 as the better aircraft and i’d like to point something out.
more likely, airbus wouldn’t roll such an aircraft out until 2030.
the orders its racked up so far are fairly paltry and at risk, in my opinion.
both manufacturers know that their order books are soft.
check out what engine is on that aircraft.
yes, initial orders are high(ish) but consider this: annual production of the 737 and a320 already exceeds 800 aircraft a year.
you want to satisfy airlines with new aircraft but some of those who buy aircraft are lessors and you don’t want to anger them by depreciating their assets they already hold.
airbus need to work hard getting their current production sold until their aircraft are in place but without depreciating values and without massive discounts to encourage orders.
boeing/mcdonnel douglas pitted the 717 against the embraer 170/190 and got its hat handed to them.
the market will become flooded with cheap, relatively new “classic” single aisle airliners with a new single aisle airliner introduction.
it would require another production line and even more suppliers for airliners that are now fairly obsolete in light of the a320neo and 737max.
tam has 27 a350-900s ordered and i think that order *might* be at risk.
southwest is doing this by buying the 737-800.
assuming it can take deliveries in 2017, that means the max stays in the fleet for as long as 2037 or longer.
boeing plays a bit more fair in this area in that it doesn’t “count” something as a committment until it is a firm order.
this is a nice launch for cfm and stands in contrast with order a320neo orders that have listed pratt pw1100g as their choice of engine.
but right now the cfm leap56 offers the same performance with great reliability and reduced risk for the owner.
boeing will simply add more and more substantiation to their claims as they continue discussions with airlines.
filed under: airline fleets, airline news by ajax no comments » american airlines apparently is playing the ryanair game with both boeing and airbus by using a 250 aircraft orders as both a carrot and a stick.
until the world economies recover, the best the industry can hope to do is manage its problems and earn a bit of money.
american airlines is a great example and they’ve made their order.
my problem with this is that it simply confirms the airbus a320neo as the right move and offers boeing little advantage over the next 10 to 15 years and possibly puts it at a disadvantage over that time frame since there are fewer areas to incrementally improve performance of that airframe over time.
say what you want (like it doesn’t include any us network carriers or boeing customers), they put it up there in 6 months and they did it much like boeing did the 787 orders.
some are older than those inefficient 737-300 aircraft and no longer have the fuel efficiency that the latest airbus offerings possess.
these are efficient, for their time, but very inefficient when compared to the latest modesl coming off boeing’s line.
airlines such as southwest realize that a smaller airliner is probably necessary for growth now that they have the nation’s largest cities essentially covered.
the merged airline would, upon conclusion, have far more boeing aircraft and far more resources to service and operate boeing aircraft than airbus aircraft.
once the performance of that aircraft is established, i think we’ll see orders from us and european airlines come in large numbers.
this is an airline that 6 years later is still effectively operating as two airlines (under one name).
what it doesn’t really have anymore is that 70’s/80’s fleet of aircraft with really inefficient engines a la md-80s and what it does have in that category, it’s getting rid of fast.
furthermore, it even gives boeing an “in” with the us airways executive team that it has not had for some time.
so far, they’re impressed but what they’ve seen of the 737max so far does not.
the a320neo and 737max aircraft are interim solutions.
a full mix of a319/320/321 aircraft with multiple bases or b) a320/a321 aircraft with focused bases i rather doubt that the a319 or the b737-700 will be ordered at all.
it’s a tall order and a difficult challenge for both manufacturers.
if i were bombardier, i would be knocking on american airlines’ door with a most excellent finance package for its cseries cs100 and cs300.
building a first time, competitive single aisle mainline aircraft requirese a body of experience that china doesn’t have.
to be fair, even the 737ng is getting a bit long in the tooth and promising incremental improvements isn’t going to satisfy airlines anymore.
the middle east after ordering an insane amount of widebodies in 2011, emirates will order another insane amount of widebody aircraft and beat up on boeing about its 747-8i.
furthermore, both airlines have orders for airbus a320neo aircraft already.
they appear to be working very hard to make every gain possible against their competitors to bring even more to the table.
if you’re an airbus customer and you need a single aisle airliner, you’re pretty much going to order the neo.
the oldest a320 series aircraft are now due for replacement as well.
and there is no airliner being offered that quite gets the airlines there.
it has serious impacts from labor groups who cannot agree on what day it is much less on who represents them with the company (this would be the pilots) and it still doesn’t have a combined seniority list with one agreement in place with both the pilots and the flight attendants.
fighting off bombardier and embraer just expends money on low return investments.
most see latam going with oneworld and while i can’t disagree with the arguments, i think that skyteam and/or star alliance might just swoop in with one hell of a package that may be too hard to resist.
embraer gets close but it doesn’t quite get there.
now that airlines know what is going to happen with both the airbus a320 series and boeing 737 series aircraft, they can start shopping for that next class of aircraft that permits entry into those smaller markets cost effectively.
however, the airline wasn’t without some trouble: airtran pilots tried real hard to step on their on feet in a seniority deal with southwest airline pilots.
no huge numbers but large enough to make a splash.
i do wonder how much longer lufthansa can rely upon its a340 aircraft and somewhat expect lufthansa to bite the bullet and buy the 777.
an airliner series with practical passenger capacities ranging from 90 to 130 seats is just what these airlines need.
i was certain that we would hear other airlines grumble about being kept out of the loop or shout with joy that they, too, wanted to order the aircraft.
this is not an all new aircraft with all new materials and airlines will expect it on time or early.
simply put, delta is replacing exactly what needs replacement and not buying one aircraft more than necessary.
the aircraft of choice will be, i think, the airbus a320neo
furthermore, i think boeing may be able to offer earlier delivery positions than airbus can.
but with the decision made, i also have to credit boeing for appearing to have decided to go all in.
the a320neo is something that american needs more than most network airlines.
even if the legacy and superlegacy airlines get pilots to agree to new scope clauses that permit them to engage regional airlines for that 90 to 130 seat flying, somebody has to buy the aircraft and fly them.
it’s learning curve with new materials and design approaches has peaked.
i think we’ll see alaska airlines find even more odd partners for its success and still manage to cozy up close to delta while doing it.
the a319 and 737-700 seat roughly 135 or more passengers.
airbus’ introduction of the neo made it much more imperative to deliver more efficiency now rather than a decade later.
their size (and the size of several competitors) demand manufacturing positions that can’t be serviced exclusively by one manufacturer.
for a tiny bit more in costs, southwest can fly significantly more passengers on routes that are seeing enormous demand.
this is a big win for cfm and its leap56 engine and while the engine is only announced for the 737re, it is almost certain that that engine will be chosen for the a320 family.
virgin atlantic didn’t die, didn’t find new partners and didn’t extricate itself from the chokehold that singapore airlines has on it.
we’re already seeing it in some airlines such as american airlines who has finally realized that if it dumps its md-80 aircraft, it can not only enjoy double digit improvements in fuel efficiency, it can fly more people as well.
delta has a fairly mixed fleet with both boeing and airbus products.
furthermore, airlines need to hedge against their labor costs which will only grow over time.
but they are going away because they are fuel inefficient and they’re getting old to boot.
filed under: airline news by ajax no comments » world alliances i’m not sure we’ll see much in this territory for skyteam or star alliance.
airlines put off buying large quantities of aircraft for quite a long time and now the legacy airlines not only want them, they need them.
they can make more money for a tiny incremental cost in fuel and one additional flight attendant.
so, at best, the max is an interim solution for airines like southwest (and ryanair and others) and you don’t go deep on interim solutions.
third, when you look at who these committments come from, it isn’t game changing.
the capital costs are low compared to current boeing aircraft and the airliner provides close to current boeing efficiencies.
in addition, i think we may well see a follow on order for the 737max aircraft again in the -800/-900 configurations.
if it does turn out to be a robust engine with good lifecycle costs, it may well be the leader going forward.
the strategy of using airbus for narrow bodies and boeing for wide bodies seems to be a smart one for airlines in that region.
however, let’s not forget that fuel is a problem for *every* airline.
one great example is lion airways order from boeing.
it will fit almost all of the missions the 757 is currently serving (except for trans-atlantic flights) and it will do it with pretty good efficiency compared to what boeing is offering right now.
electronic bleed air will be added to improve cabin pressurization (which is much like how the a350 will use bleed air)and better means more efficient fuel burn.
if it is and if there is an order, it will be a major blow to boeing.
hedging is supposed to “smooth” that volatility and it will except that it also causes paper losses which reflect negatively on the airline when it announces its financial performance.
i do expect ryanair to make an order and i do think it will be the 737max.
iag also managed to get a tentative deal to buy bmi from lufthansa and become the emperor of slots at london heathrow . . .
for most airlines, going deep on the a320neo is the wrong decision.
their profits are not taking a hit from hedging contracts that “lose” money.
in fact, us airways performance is exceptional when balanced against the challenges it has.
one thing is sure, the comac 919 isn’t going to deliver what ryanair needs and certainly not on time.
i’m talking about 2002/2003 time periods which were a result of september 11, 2001 attacks that reduced air traffic dramatically and killed the finances of airlines around the world.
this may well be the “major network carrier” that airbus coo john leahy has spoken of with respect to the a320neo.
this order will be of dramatic benefit for the airline when it comes to saving on fuel.
you want to satisfy airlines with new aircraft but some of those who buy aircraft are lessors and you don’t want to anger them by depreciating their assets they already hold.
they’ve made it out like the a320neo is a no-brainer for development and while it is an incremental improvement, the engineering to deliver is non-trivial.
the folly is that ramping up production comes with fairly high costs and the only way to justify those costs is to be able to show that you’ll have an order list that will sustain those high production rates.
the 767-200er is already clearly a candidate for removal and the 767-300 isn’t far behind it.
the lack of any other orders even getting mentioned as rumours tells us just how fast the aa deal was put together.
air india gets more money and we wonder why.
despite its efforts, i think we’ll see more schedule slip and it won’t reveal the entire picture as that unfolds.
iberia pilots decided to strike because shooting onself in the foot can’t be just an indian thing.
the current fleet of airbus a319s are “good enough” and while some of the a320 aircraft are getting older now, they aren’t quite old enought to start planning retirement of until those older 737-500 and 757-200 aircraft are replaced.
american airlines struggled (more) and lost more than a billion dollars (again).
the truth is, it isn’t high fuel prices that are killing airlines.
it’s an iae v2500, the same that is sold today on the airbus a320 series.
