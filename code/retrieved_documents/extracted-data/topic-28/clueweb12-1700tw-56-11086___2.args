that pilot must not be afraid of stalls, either that or he is trying to scare to co-pilot, amazing shot.

the photographer is actually a bit above the aircraft's heading as well.
a visitor from united kingdom posted sun september 25, 2005:
even allowing for angle and perspective, the 747 is still almost perpendicular to the runway.

a visitor from united states posted wed september 7, 2005: very nice shot, thats got to be one of the hardest shots to ever get, i can't believe the 747 is taking of at what looks like such a steep angle a visitor from germany posted tue september 6, 2005: very unique shot.

a visitor from netherlands posted sat october 13, 2007: seriously the most impressive airline picture i've on this website and that tells something!!!
the best shots taken looking out from the window or cockpit.
amazing shot.but why is it possible to come this close to a 744 on take off,scary indeed.
it looks like it´s climbing vertical, only the signs on the runway tells you the right angle.
a visitor from sweden posted sat february 6, 2010: wow, best fot ever!!!
a visitor from egypt posted tue october 20, 2009: i've calculated the angle of climbing of the 747, by assuming that the crossed taxiways are perpendicular to the runway, so the deformation of the picture is 3.1:4.3 so sin(-1) gives 45 degree !!!
pictures that make me smile by member ordboy i have always loved flying, and these pics showcase its beauty kool shots by member trant78 just some plain kool shots!!!
it's not even at the end of the runway and has gained altitude.
a truly unique attitude for the a/c and the photographer.
a graet shot, what are the chances that some one will be in that position and have a camera ready, be able to focus and take the picture.
a visitor from united kingdom posted thu august 17, 2006: i cant get enough of this shot......its absolutely amazing, it really shows what the giant beast can do...
i mean the aircraft and the runway looks impossible that way?
a visitor from united states posted fri december 16, 2005: now, i must say that it is an expectacular shot, but is beyond me to know how this person took this shot.
catching the 747 just after takeoff and framed by the patterns on the runway below.
it must have been an amazing sight and experience to be there.
a visitor from turkey posted sun april 30, 2006: super photo, i hope it is not fake... a visitor from mexico posted wed april 26, 2006:
great timing too, the capture of the gear transition is perfect, and you gotta love the wing flex from a high gross weight take-off.
a visitor from russian federation posted sun january 16, 2011: it is not understandable that for the place of the photographing!
the subject itself (i think the 747 is an awesome sight), the graceful curve of the wings.
it is the coolest view.
my personal favorites by member winair anything beautiful or that has a special meaning to me.

a visitor from united states posted thu april 13, 2006: looks like a rocket going straight up.
a visitor from united states posted tue april 25, 2006: that'll put those passengers in their seats!!!
that pilot must not be afraid of stalls, either that or he is trying to scare to co-pilot, amazing shot.
a visitor from canada posted tue november 30, 2010: hats off, well done.
startling view and almost perfect framing a visitor from germany posted sun march 9, 2008: really best.
a visitor from united kingdom posted tue september 25, 2007: i've seen aircraft photographed from all angles before, but this is the first time from this angle.
a visitor from canada posted fri february 24, 2006: this is not a fake, look at the radii of the arcs painted on the tarmac.
a visitor from singapore posted thu july 26, 2007: looks just like an eagle charging towards its prey with its wings flapping hard and feet curled in ready to grab.
a visitor from united states posted thu july 6, 2006: props to the photographer, to get this shot at this angle, while getting all of the camera settings right at the rigght moment.
this was shot with a very long lens from out over the ocean -- probably close to 1.5 to 2 miles from the lift off point.

i love the plane being perfectly centered on the target (you).
a visitor from south africa posted sun may 7, 2006: this is no doubt a one in million shot, however the idea of playing chicken with a 747 is rather disturbing.
i've flown a couple of time to lax corridor, but had no luck encountering such situation (but hey, i had only a pocket camera anyway!).
a visitor from united kingdom posted sun may 27, 2007: an amazing photo and rather surprising !
