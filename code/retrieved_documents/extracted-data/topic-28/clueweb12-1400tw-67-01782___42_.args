regardless of how the engine issue evolves on the boeing 737 max, the 737 max family aircraft nevertheless hold an advantage over the a320neo (new engine option) on an all-in operating cost basis, albeit at a reduced level, and the cfm leap-1b engine will be a highly-efficient engine, whichaspire aviation‘s sources say have made progress in clawing back the rumoured 2%-3% shortfall in engine specific fuel consumption (sfc).in doing so, not only are the structural reinforcement and modification required on the 737 max minimised, it will also further boost the market appeal of the 737 max to airlines around the world.last but not least, the sales prospect of the 737 max remains bullish and boeingexpects to receive 200 737 max orders from china this year to satisfy the world’s second-largest aviation market’s burgeoning air travel demand, and the strong underlying demand for re-engined aircraft, combined with a strong backlog, should insulate or minimise any risks should this upward industry cycle be halted by any unforeseen events in this volatile global economy.the key enabler of such a game-changing small twin-aisle aircraft that features containerised cargo system, fast turnaround times and significant reductions in cash operating costs (coc), the 2nd or 3rd-generation composites with out-of-autoclave (ooa) technology, such as australia’s quickstep  that trims the curing time by a dramatic 43%, a higher delamination resistance and a higher fibre-matrix adhesion achieved through “lower initial resin viscosity”, is emerging and will require time to mature and find its way into wider aerospace applications, as are nanotechnologies such as the carbon nanotubes reinforced polymer (cnrp) on the lockheed martinthe key enabler of such a game-changing small twin-aisle aircraft that features containerised cargo system, fast turnaround times and significant reductions in cash operating costs (coc), the 2nd or 3rd-generation composites with out-of-autoclave (ooa) technology, such as australia’s quickstep that trims the curing time by a dramatic 43%, a higher delamination resistance and a higher fibre-matrix adhesion achieved through “lower initial resin viscosity”, is emerging and will require time to mature and find its way into wider aerospace applications, as are nanotechnologies such as the carbon nanotubes reinforced polymer (cnrp) on the lockheed martin f-35 lightning ii joint strike fighter (jsf) that promise to be 17% stronger and yet 30% lighter than the carbon fibre reinforced polymer (cfrp) found on 50% of the 787 dreamliner by weight.the only reason the 320 has sold so well is because of a massive 737 backlog and deep discounting made possible by massive and illegal eu subsidies.we’re going to take full advantage of the integration we do with boeing and with spirit to make sure the overall engine-airplane combination is incredibly efficient from an integrated propulsion system and the engine is really optimised for this airplane.”in addition, boeing is actively evaluating more weight-reduction and drag reduction initiatives in order to make the 737 max more aerodynamically and more fuel efficient, and it looks increasingly likely that this year’s continuous lower energy emissions noise (cleen) programme, scheduled to take place this late third-quarter on board an american airlines (aa) boeing 737-800 in collaboration with the us federal aviation administration (faa), will be a springboard for testing these initiatives, especially the drag reduction ones.it has lower trip costs at essentially every distance, 15-20% more range, and 5-9% more seats depending on configuration.and as the next-generation narrowbody engines featuring advanced engine core technologies form the centrepiece of the upgrade from the existing single-aisle airplanes, which delivers the bulk of the 737 max and a320neo’s fuel-burn savings, the economics of engines, or “enginomics”, are likely to continue to be the prime focus of these aircraft programmes as they developments advance and progress.the 777 literally killed off the a340, and the 737ng still holds high single digit seat cost advantages over the a320 family.while the 787 program is looking like a train wreck, the composite technologies on the aircraft are at least 5 years ahead of airbus and the a350, which looks likely to incur massive delays.time will tell, but my prediction is that boeing will continue to enjoy superior pricing for superior products which explains why the company is more profitable than eads by about 100% in terms of return on investment (roi).meanwhile, the business case of re-engined aircraft such as the boeing 737 max, a320neo (new engine option) and the re-engined e-jet remains sound, as airlines’ demand for fuel efficient aircraft ever grows in light of skyrocketing jet kerosene prices.“compared to airbus a320neo, which is the european firm’s latest single-aisle plane, the 737 max is 10% lighter and 5% more fuel efficient.
