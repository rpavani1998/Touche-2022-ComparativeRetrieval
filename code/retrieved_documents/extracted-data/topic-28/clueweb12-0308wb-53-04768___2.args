at the same time airbus and boeing also launched update projects for the 330 (the 350 project) and for the 747, respectively.
the stock of the european planemaker's parent rose just 0.8 percent over the last two years, while boeing surged 51 percent.
they had 25 orders on a projected demand of 50 of these (from a big leasing company, ups, and fedex, but apparently ups is the only active order left - for only 10 units.
they needed 400 plus a380 sales to break even - but that was the figure a while ago.
2007 superfrenchie: so airbus had its best day ever yesterday, with an astounding $45 billion single day list of orders [fr] (boeing: 1.4 billion…) interestingly enough, the wall street journal editorial page, which loves predicting airbus’ demise, has not commented yet… bloomberg about the plane makers' order books: boeing's total for the year as of may was 417, more than double the orders at airbus, which said on june 7 it had a total of 201 contracts through the end of may.
boeing dropped 75 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $97.40 in new york.
the additional costs of the debacle and the concession pricing they are having to give on the a380 are probably pushing that figure up quite a bit.
if boeing can get the 787 dreamliner launched on time or without major delay (less than a year)
so the speculation was that the cargo version would take too much engineering talent for only 10 aircraft; talent which would be better-used on the a350 xwb project (which apparently is hurting due to the a380 delays).
shares of eads fell 16 cents, or 0.7 percent, to 24.12 euros yesterday in paris.
but airbus appeared to be in a similarly enviable position in 2003 before the 380 debacle came out - so that is reason for caution.
good examples were the delays on the boeing 747 (which almost bankrupted the company) and the a380 debacle.
i'll believe the tales (for both the a380 and the 787) when i see an actual customer take deliver and begin flying on regular routse.....
a cautionary fact is that there are usually major delays with *all-new* aircraft.
http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/fn/4904992.html one thing of interest is that the airbus 350 xwb seesm to be more than 4 years behind the 787, with initial deliveries of the 350 in 2013 with the first 787 scheduled for delivery in 2008.
the like i posted in the first post (http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/06/airbus_struts_its_stuff_in_par.html) said that airbus were selling a lot of the existing 320 and 330 midsize designs at fairly steep discounts.
airbus was in a very strong position and boeing a weak one at the time, and airbus seemed to decide to go for a knockout blow against boeing's 747 large jet.
but profits from the a380 look ever further away.
i suspect that many carriers will buy from airbus everything else equal - at least until embraer (brazil) grows up a little more.
the trouble is that the needs of the 380 project are hurting the 350.
so airbus had its best day ever yesterday, with an astounding $45 billion single day list of orders [fr] (boeing: 1.4 billion…) interestingly enough, the wall street journal editorial page, which loves predicting airbus’ demise, has not commented yet…bloomberg about the plane makers' order books: boeing's total for the year as of may was 417, more than double the orders at airbus, which said on june 7 it had a total of 201 contracts through the end of may.
i rather doubt that airbus will go out of business.
the stock of the european planemaker's parent rose just 0.8 percent over the last two years, while boeing surged 51 percent.
another potential problem is that the 350 xwb project may not be an adventerous enough design to prevail against the 787.
one point in airbus' favor is that customers like having more than one supplier as it tends to keep the current leader honest.
there may be difficulties manufacturing the all-carbon frame which the hybrid approach aleviates, but the latter appraoch is heavier and less fuel-efficient plus there are questions raised on how well it will work in service due to different cooefficients of expansion/retraction between the different materials.
shares of eads fell 16 cents, or 0.7 percent, to 24.12 euros yesterday in paris.
the skyrocketing of fuel prices (which made the 787 a huge order-book hit) and the long delay in the 380 launch have strengthened boeing's hand a great deal.
they are both desperately needed, the 380 because so many resources have been used and the 350 to protect airbus core market in midsize aircraft.
this makes sense because they still make money even with the discounts and can use the cash to pay for the concessions they are having to give to keep some of the airbus a380 orderers on board.
another heavy rumor is that the cargo congiguration of the a380 may be binned at least for now.
