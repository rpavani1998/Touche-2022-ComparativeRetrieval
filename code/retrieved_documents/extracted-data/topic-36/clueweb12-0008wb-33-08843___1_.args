as a good developer should do, i started looking on eclipse’s bugzilla and after some wandering i finallyhit it.i tried other plug-ins and even updating eclipse using the official way (help -> software update), but the behavior was the same.eclipse plug-in installer kept failing on me complaining about some other plug-in dependencies breakage even that all i did was selecting android’s plug-in.recently, i installed it over my macbook running mac os x.tbstore não tem :-(2 weeks ago - dear lazy web, shall i use #gitorious or #gitosis or anything else for git repo management?4 weeks ago - would be so nice if #jenkins was to support theming.he told me that “europa is around for some time” and so “they would have run into it”..
