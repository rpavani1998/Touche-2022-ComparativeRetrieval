after creating a netbeans project from an eclipse project, you can work in the following ways: use netbeans on a team project where other developers are using eclipse.
when you build or run your project in netbeans, the project's sources are compiled into this folder.
if the classpath in the eclipse has changed since you initially imported it, you can use the resynchronize eclipse projects feature to update the classpath in the corresponding netbeans project.
unknown project type - it cannot be imported.
this enables you to work on projects in netbeans even if everybody else on your team is working with eclipse.
once you have the project imported into netbeans, you can build and run the project.
if the compile on save feature is enabled, the build command is disabled.

you can customize this script according to the needs of your project.
the project import does not impose changes on the eclipse project structure, so it does not interfere with the way the project works in eclipse.
the ide also resynchronizes the projects automatically if the changes to the eclipse configuration are unambiguous and do not require your input.
the import eclipse project wizard enables you to use netbeans to work on java desktop and web application projects that were created in eclipse and myeclipse.

you can resolve these references immediately by right-clicking the project node and choosing resolve reference problems or resolve missing server.
for some of these problems, a menu item, such as resolve missing server problem, appears in the contextual menu for the project.
you can solve this problem after dismissing this dialog box by right-clicking the project's node and choosing resolve missing server.
if you make changes to the project structure in netbeans, those changes are not propagated to the eclipse project with the resynchronization feature.

in most cases, this means that the netbeans project metadata will refer to sources and libraries with the same paths that are used by the eclipse metadata.
if the resynchronization requires your input, you need to manually resynchronize the project.
netbeans uses the sources and libraries in the original eclipse project folder but creates a separate folder to hold netbeans project metadata and build outputs.
such outputs might be jar files and war files.
notes: when you resynchronize a project, the resynchronization is performed on all projects that you have imported from the workspace.
you can resolve these references immediately by right-clicking the project node and choosing resolve reference problems or resolve missing server.
