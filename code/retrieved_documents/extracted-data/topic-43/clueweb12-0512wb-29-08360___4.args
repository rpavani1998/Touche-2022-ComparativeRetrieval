the sony has a lag of about a second and that makes some difficult shots hard unless you use burst.
nikon makes a really good product overall rating 5 of 5 value rating 5 of 5 used product for more than 1 year visitors rate this review 4.82 of 5, 28 votes price paid: $660.00 from mifsuds summary:i've used it for over a year now, mainly for outdoor and wildlife photography, in the uk, the falklands, and antarctica, and it's hardly ever fallen short.
the sony is manual but not to the extent the nikon is.
the only feature i’ve ‘missed’ is a more advanced af (like the d300’s 51-point af system) to help with tracking fast-moving wildlife, but that’s on 1% of the time.
for more professional, accurate and detailed shots the nikon takes that one.
the nikon uses sd flash cards for storage which is fast and no moving parts.
especially all the camera dealers, established & authorized camera dealers are 200% friendly, pleasant & enterprising persons.
for all 'round use the sony takes the cake.
i will have to resize all the nikon shots to compress storage size on the hard drive.
the sony has a wall powerd charger to a small 'brick' transformer you plug directly into the camera.
is all but impossible to beat the quality for the money nikon will give you.
and if you shoot inside, you need the double shoe option so the infrared that sits in the flash shoe can occupy one shoe while the flash the other.
especially all the camera dealers, established & authorized camera dealers are 200% friendly, pleasant & enterprising persons.
to recharge a battery it has to be taken out, another work load.
the nikon software is not needed so i got rid of it.
this is pretty much a good all 'round lens but others are definately needed for more cultured shots.
the nikon offers a huge variety of lenses, the sony has the built in plus a few external filter thread screw on aux lenses which work fine for the amature photog, the pro of course would frown deeply at that and dive for the nikon.
it feels a bit light and small to my taste, especially with larger lenses, but that's soon fixed with a battery grip.
the response i am getting by d90 is very good.
so when they get full i format them and start again.
each & every camera was built & produced top class.
especialy if i use the large mega pix size you should be able to count the cells on a person's arm from 200 feet!
my pic's are tack sharp and the hd feature is awesome.
i use the low end fine for almost all shots and that works fine.
i don't see any advantage on editing raw format for the jpg editors that are out there.
pictures are sharp as a razor and color is more than perfect.
the settings are in easy to reach places and the camera is not that heavy.
again, the sony is best for the amature and the nikon is for the pro where it has all the stuff in a camera a pro will need.
review 1 of 17 price paid: $1475.00 summary:from my 1st film nikon nikkormat,f80,f100, d70s,d50 to d90 each & every camera was built & produced top class.
all my photos are saved on a dedicated hard drive partition and down loaded directly from the camera soon after the shots.
any where in australia what ever u buy anything for the matter the customer service is #1.
not too heavy and is pretty well made.
rev. j. gordon bengtson aarrow-ranch aviation mechanicsville, virginia 23111 strengths:superior image quality, hardware durability, support from nikon.
the nikon needs several buttons to start the movie and they are on the back of the camera making manipulation of movie start and stop a chore that could easily, way too easily mess up start and stop portion of the movie.
weaknesses:af-tracking struggles with fast-moving subjects (the 11 af points can constantly hunt and fail to maintain any useful lock...
the camera is used for that, on the nikon i use a flash drive adapter in a usb port to format the cards.
it just always performs and is completely intuitive to use.
so nothing to fret about since the d90 is again a classic & top quality camera in all respects.
nikon has burst also so both work fine.
the nikon is totally manual as were the 35 mm cameras if you choose as well as manual.
strengths:i cannot comment to the pro's level.
another thing is the nikon offers only 3 different size pictures, 3, 6, and 12 meg size in either jpg format or the nikon nkx (or something like that).
set up in the camera is in cmos so nothing is lost when the battery is removed but is a bit awkward.
as far as i am concerned it is very high quality, it's got the lamborgani power & rolls royce smoothness.
haven't sent any nikon pics to the printer, but i have a very high end printer so they should come out better than kodak right here in the house.
if you use the nikon file type you can use their software to manipulate the picture, but a good jpg picture program, and there are many even free ones, that will do an excellent job of the same basic thing so nikon format is not needed.
smaller sizes work just fine and even make quite attractive 8 x 10 blow ups.
especially the build quality is matchless.
one is the self timer where i can set the camera on a tripod, set the timer and stand back to take a pic of myself or something.
the 12 meg will make poster size but also will use up a ton of disk space to save the pics.
especially the build quality is matchless.
i had to uninstall all the nikon software where it simply took over my computer for photos and i have other things i use that work just fine, some basic ones are from microsoft!
i’ve compared results to a friend’s d300 images and we really can’t tell any difference, though the d700 images have a bit more to them.
as far as i am concerned it is very high quality, it's got the lamborgani power & rolls royce smoothness.
but then that just encourages good technique!); and the video mode is too limited to be really fun or useful.
the sony is a great amature camera.
weaknesses:none so far similar products used:i dont have any other nikon products this is my first and i will be buying more.
the picture and the quality is very good.
and anything in-between would be money better spent on lenses.
the lens is very good.

so the nikon has far superior lenses.
so nothing to fret about since the d90 is again a classic & top quality camera in all respects.
any fish eye will distort the image but this one does not do a terrible job of it leaving the picture as is with distortion all but beyond notice.
the nikon is better of course because of the speed.
the sony uses mini cds which in time will wear out and need expensive service.
yet the lesser brands will give you options and attributes as standard function nikon will charge you dearly for.
one is the infrared trigger to set the camera off.
it also has a great depth of controls and features, so you can tailor it to your needs and preferences, and i’ve done a3 prints from it with stunning quality.
i have purchased vr lens 18mm-105mm.
any where in australia what ever u buy anything for the matter the customer service is #1.
the nikon shutter launches almost in a nano second taking a picture.
sony movies are fine in mpeg format, the eaze of the sony makes it a far better choice but if you want quality of image the nikon of course is the better choice.
yet what ever you get on your nikon you will have a superior product that will last you many years.
the nikon does not have this unless you buy at least one option.
with that and also comparisons to other friends’ equivalent canon and sony systems, i’d only ever consider upgrading to a full-frame sensor model as i reckon this is about as good as dx sensors can get without squuzing yet more pixels on and creating noise issues.
overall rating 5 of 5 value rating 5 of 5 used product for less than 1 month visitors rate this review 3.86 of 5, 35 votes price paid: $1089.00 from camerta summary:the nikon d90 camera is the best one i have ever bought and have had some very high end stuff in my life.
the sony in full auto works perfectly as does the nikon.
the basic xp platform will 'see' the camera as another hard drive where you can copy and paste from the camera to the computer and do what ever.
one in particular is super, is a semi fish eye that is fabulous for inside shots where it will take your subject, floor, ceiling and walls side to side getting the whole thing, if that is what you want.
the nikon has a small wall powered charger but the battery has to come out of the camera.
this product is a 5 star in my book awesome camera strengths:quick auto foucus nice "tack sharp " photos easy to understand and to use.
first snap starts the movie and second stops it giving you total control.
the avi the nikon takes is extremely sharp, like a high end movie camera so in that aspect it is better than the sony but that is the only advantage.
i had also baught a few books on how the nikon d90 works and functions.
the nikon has the advanage but the sony has definite qualities that do not throw it out of the park.
i use compupic which works quite well.
i have several add on lenses for the sony and they work great for me.
the nikon i bought came with an 18 mm to 105 mm lens.
summary:hi readers& viewers i am using d90 camera.
so this limits your size capabilities without resizing every shot.
weaknesses:some functions are very awkward like starting and stopping movie mode.
the sony will allow you to set your pic size from about 80k standard/160k fine on the low end to 5 meg in 1 meg incraments giving you allot of choices.
