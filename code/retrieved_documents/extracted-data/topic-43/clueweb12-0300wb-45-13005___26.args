this accelerates the already snappy focusing time by following the subject's movement before the shutter release button is pressed half way (only works when the focus is set to multi af or spot af).
s10 camera unit a12 camera unit one other benefit of the interchangeable camera unit that ricoh is promoting is the avoidance of dust on the sensor.
disregarding any differences in image quality, it seems to us that the s10 is almost exactly replicating one of ricoh's existing compacts in the gxr format, albeit in a larger size and perhaps more importantly with a much bigger price-tag.
this is a great feature the helps bridge the gap between compact and dslr cameras.
more interesting is the a12 unit, which has a 12.3 aps-c image sensor and a 50mm f/2.5 fixed-focal macro lens.
in the fastest continuous mode the camera takes 3 frames per second with the 50mm unit but only 1.6 fps with the 24-72mm unit, both rates for an unlimited number of jpeg or raw images, which doesn't compare particularly well to even entry-level dslrs.
you can additionally buy the completely removable optical viewfinder, the new vf-2.
level compensation allows you to correct the contrast and tone of an image after it has been taken, and white balance compensation the white balance.
on the focusing side, the multi af system has 9 separate auto focus points, and there's also spot af, manual focus, snap mode (can be changed to focus at either 1m, 2.5m, 5m or infinity) and infinity.
the skew correction function alters any photo that was taken at an angle so it appears as if it were taken directly in front of you.
for everyone else, the gxr is simply a joy to use for any photographer that wants full control over their camera, with proven handling and a seemingly infinite level of customisation.
in all this discussion about the benefits of particular lens and sensor combinations, it quickly becomes apparent that ricoh are playing something of a guessing game with their camera unit offerings, hoping that they've hit upon the best solutions for the majority of photographers.
with the gxr, the closed nature of the system promises to keep the image sensor dust-free, and i we certainly couldn't detect any in the images that we shot.
the display button toggles detailed settings information about each picture on and off, such as the iso rating and aperture / shutter speed, and there is a small histogram available during both shooting and playback.
there are over 20 external controls, leaving just enough room for that gorgeous 3 inch lcd screen.
the new flag function setting option allows you to choose up to 20 images that can then be quickly played back by selecting the flag function display option, useful for showing off key images.
in terms of metering, the multi metering mode is 256 segment, and there's also center weighted average and spot metering.
compared to the direct competition, it's better than the panasonic gf1's viewfinder, but not quite as good as the olympus e-p2's.
the high resolution lcd provides a wide viewing angle and high contrast., with a special fluorine coat and hard coating to help prevent scratches, and 100% srgb coverage for more accurate color reproduction.
both text and images really come alive on a simply breath-taking display that's the best of any camera that we've ever reviewed, including those with comparable 920k dot screens.
completing the gxr's extensive range of focusing options is pre-af.
the 50mm unit is a little slower, with a distinct pause as it physically moves in and out before locking onto the subject, and it often failed to focus at all on low-contrast subjects.
completing the gxr's extensive range of focusing options is pre-af.
on the flip side, though, dust can also get in via the lens barrel, particularly of a zoom lens, so it will be interesting to see if long-term users report problems, especially as there's obviously no way to clean the sensor yourself, or any automatic dust-reduction system built into the gxr body.
this is an excellent move by ricoh, with no waiting required for third-party software vendors like adobe, phase one dxo to play catch-up.
press it in to alter white balance, iso speed, quality, image settings and the af target, which allows you to shift the target for af or ae or both without having to move the camera.
the navigation pad on the rear offers fn1 and fn2 settings, both of which can be re-configured to (by default they change the focus type and the manual flash amount) and pressing up and down increases and decreases exposure compensation.
quite a lot of the camera's main options, such as image size, sharpness, metering mode and continuous mode, are accessed here, so the shooting settings menu has 23 options spread over 3 screens, the key custom options menu has 16 options, and the setup menu has 34 options.
when the gxr is fitted with this unit, it's automatically in the same league as a dslr or the other compact cameras that have an aps-c sensor, the sigma dp1 and dp2.
finally, the gxr uses an up/down rocker switch on the back of the camera for operating the zoom when used with an applicable camera unit (and image magnification during playback), although disappointingly it can't be re-configured when used with the a12 / 50mm unit.
with a conventional dslr, it's inherently much easier to change the lens and retain the same sensor - with the gxr system, at least on launch, you have to accept the change of both lens and sensor, and the particular combinations on offer.
the choice of the 50mm macro lens is also interesting, in that a focal length of 50mm is useful for street photography as well as close-ups of flowers, providing an angle of view roughly equivalent to human vision, and the fast maximum aperture of f/2.5 is a real benefit for low-light shooting and creating that out-of-focus bokeh look.
the gxr will feel instantly familiar to anyone who has used a recent ricoh compact before, as it inherits the design approach and many of the features from the gr and gx series cameras.
this allows you to configure the gxr for different uses and allows quick access to each configuration (the camera remembers the settings when it's turned off).
when pressed a graphical representation of most of the key settings is displayed on the lcd, very similar to the system that many dslrs offer.
one other benefit of the interchangeable camera unit that ricoh is promoting is the avoidance of dust on the sensor.
images are automatically rotated during playback to fit the current orientation of the camera.
when taking a photo, pressing the display button toggles between the detailed information, the histogram and gridlines to aid composition.
this is an excellent move by ricoh, with no waiting required for third-party software vendors like adobe, phase one dxo to play catch-up.
returning to the camera body, there are four external controls which form the creative heart of the gxr.
the white saturation display mode during image playback indicates over-exposed highlights by flashing those areas on and off.
once you have captured a photo, the gxr has an above average range of options when it comes to playing, reviewing and managing your images.
you can view the horizontal indicator on the lcd monitor to ensure that shots are aligned horizontally.
the display button toggles detailed settings information about each picture on and off, such as the iso rating and aperture / shutter speed, and there is a small histogram available during both shooting and playback.
with a conventional dslr, it's inherently much easier to change the lens and retain the same sensor - with the gxr system, at least on launch, you have to accept the change of both lens and sensor, and the particular combinations on offer.
the all-metal tripod mount is the final give-away sign that this is intended to be a serious product, although the design of the interchangeable unit camera system means that it's not in-line either with the lens or the centre of the body.
develop your photo’s in to high quality canvas prints from £14.99.
in summary the ricoh gxr is a remarkably intuitive and customisable camera, especially considering that it's a first-generation product in a completely new photographic system.
utilising a magnesium alloy body, the gxr is an extremely well-built camera, continuing the long-established ricoh tradition of producing serious photographic tools.
personally speaking, i would have preferred to see the s10 use an aps-c sensor rather than the tiny 1/1.7-inch sensor - if i'm going to use a larger camera than ricoh's existing compacts, then i'd prefer a bigger sensor with all the image quality benefits that it hopefully provides.

these controls allow you to choose which shooting mode you want to use, with a choice of full auto, program shift, aperture-priority, shutter-priority and full manual, and to control the settings of the particular mode that you have picked.
that ultimately means that some photographers are going to be left out, as ricoh obviously can't make every combination available.

it doesn't sound like a big deal in theory, but in practice it really helps to make all those wide-angle shots perfectly level.
digital slr’s allow you to change the lens on the front of the camera - the gxr allows you to change the lens and the image sensor, which are combined into a single interchangeable unit.
when the gxr is fitted with this unit, it's automatically in the same league as a dslr or the other compact cameras that have an aps-c sensor, the sigma dp1 and dp2.
thankfully ricoh have chosen to supply it in printed format, rather than as a pdf on a cd, so you can also carry it with you for easy reference in the field.
on the flip side, though, dust can also get in via the lens barrel, particularly of a zoom lens, so it will be interesting to see if long-term users report problems, especially as there's obviously no way to clean the sensor yourself, or any automatic dust-reduction system built into the gxr body.

the electronic leveler is a neat feature that helps to ensure level shots while viewing through the lcd monitor, both in landscape and portrait mode.
shooting in raw mode is also very quick, with the gxr only taking around 1 second to store a raw image, and you can also take another shot while it's being written to memory.
ricoh are claiming that this new approach allows them to offer the best combinations of image quality and portability - one of the gxr’s key selling points is its diminutive size, being much smaller than a traditional dslr and even tinier than the panasonic gf1 and olympus e-p1/e-p2 micro four thirds cameras.
the high resolution lcd provides a wide viewing angle and high contrast., with a special fluorine coat and hard coating to help prevent scratches, and 100% srgb coverage for more accurate color reproduction.
this is perfectly acceptable for its main use as a dedicated macro lens, but makes it less suitable for street photographer where every second counts.
due to the high-resolution lcd screen and restricting the number of on-screen choices to 10, the various options and icons are clear and legible.
this is a unique offering in the ricoh range, and is notably the first ever ricoh camera to feature the same-sized sensor that the majority of dslrs use.
furthermore, pressing the adj. dial allows you to quickly adjust 5 different settings that are commonly used.

images are automatically rotated during playback to fit the current orientation of the camera.
in practice it produces a subtle but noticeable effect that is particularly useful for capturing more natural portraits when using flash.
this slots into the hot-shoe on top of the camera, allowing you to hold the camera up to your eye and instantly giving the gxr the feel of a single-lens reflex camera.
the main menu system on the ricoh gxr is straight-forward to use and is accessed by pressing the menu/ok button in the middle of the navigation pad.
the full press snap option allows you to take a photo at one of the snap mode distances with a full press of the shutter button.
with regards to the a12 unit, the 50mm lens is a little too limiting in its outlook - ultimately i'd like the 24-72mm lens with the aps-c sensor.
thankfully ricoh have included a manual focusing ring on this camera unit, which speeds up operation if you're used to focusing in this way.
even better, the raw format that they have chosen is not a proprietary one, but adobe's dng format, which means that the ricoh gxr's files are instantly available in any raw software that supports dng (virtually every one).

multi-pattern auto white balance is a useful setting for scenes with mixed lighting - daylight and flash, or fluorescent and daylight, for example.
with regards to the a12 unit, the 50mm lens is a little too limiting in its outlook - ultimately i'd like the 24-72mm lens with the aps-c sensor.
you can additionally buy the completely removable optical viewfinder, the new vf-2.
this means that you can use both the camera's auto-focus system by half-pressing the shutter button, and over-ride it to instantly shoot at at a pre-determined distance without having to wait for the camera to focus.
the gxr is bigger and heavier than the gr digital iii, but not by as much as you'd first imagine, and it's a little smaller and lighter than the panasonic gf1, the previous holder of the "world's smallest and lightest interchangeable lens camera" title.
focusing with the 24-72mm camera unit is quick in good light, taking less than 0.5 seconds, and the camera happily achieves focus most of the time indoors or in low-light situations.
you can use the navigation pad to move through the settings and change them, and the current shooting mode, aperture, shutter speed, flash setting, battery life and exposure compensation are also shown.
this is a great feature the helps bridge the gap between compact and dslr cameras.
once you have captured a photo, the gxr has an above average range of options when it comes to playing, reviewing and managing your images.
if you don't like composing your photos by holding the camera at arms length and looking at the lcd screen, there's also another way of framing your shots.
our test results for the ricoh gxr have been submitted todiwa for comparison with test results for different samples of the same camera model supplied by otherdiwa member sites.
this combination is strikingly similar to the now discontinued ricoh gx100 compact, which had the same size sensor and the same zoom range, with the latest gx200 model increasing the megapixel count to 12.
when pressed a graphical representation of most of the key settings is displayed on the lcd, very similar to the system that many dslrs offer.
you can also judge their image quality for yourself on page 2 and see full-size samples (raw and jpg) from each one on page 3.
you can view the horizontal indicator on the lcd monitor to ensure that shots are aligned horizontally.

the white saturation display mode during image playback indicates over-exposed highlights by flashing those areas on and off.
you can instantly scroll through the images that you have taken, view thumbnails (81 onscreen at once!), zoom in and out up to 16x magnification, view slideshows with audio, set the print order, delete, protect, trim and resize an image.
the start-up time from turning the ricoh gxr on to being ready to take a photo is responsive at around 1.5 seconds.
the panasonic gf1 and olympus e-p1 / e-p2 cameras all use the smaller four thirds sensor size, so in theory the gxr with the a12 unit should deliver better image quality.
for everyone else, the gxr is simply a joy to use for any photographer that wants full control over their camera, with proven handling and a seemingly infinite level of customisation.
in terms of metering, the multi metering mode is 256 segment, and there's also center weighted average and spot metering.
instead of just taking an average reading from the whole scene, which inevitably gets the white balance wrong for the secondary light source, the gxr breaks the image down into small areas and analyzes and sets the white balance for each one.
this accelerates the already snappy focusing time by following the subject's movement before the shutter release button is pressed half way (only works when the focus is set to multi af or spot af).
the two function (fn) buttons on the rear of the camera can also be customised to suit your particular needs.
the ricoh gxr is launching with two interchangeable camera units, the s10 / 24-72mm / 10 megapixel unit and the a12 / 50mm / 12 megapixel unit, both of which were supplied to us by ricoh uk, along with the vf-2 external viewfinder and the clever lc-2 self-retaining lenscap (which only fits the s10 unit).
there's a large rubberized handgrip on the front that allows you to get a good grip and a small area of the same material acting as a thumb rest on the rear of the body.
this combination is strikingly similar to the now discontinued ricoh gx100 compact, which had the same size sensor and the same zoom range, with the latest gx200 model increasing the megapixel count to 12.
