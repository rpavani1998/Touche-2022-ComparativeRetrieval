as a codicil, the author of a spanish web site refers to an old arab fable i’d not encountered before: a young caliph asked the great vizier how he could tell if a poem was good or bad.
and i was already fragile, since i’d placed myself in the most extreme situation i could imagine, other than war—the point at which life begins and is immediately under threat.
the second major explanation for the culture wars is that they basically have been about politics, set off when ’60s radicals took their battles from the streets into university departments.
so english professors tend to experience alternative approaches to the truth as they see it as a personal affront, and cause for counterattack.
i knew i was outnumbered when one of my brightest students recounted how dr so-and-so from the art theory department had told her that feelings were a bourgeois illusion, that she should work to embed in her photographs references to key theorists.
i feel much better dealing with something i’m comfortable with.
the use of two or three bulbs, synchronized to flash together as the shutter was released, could produce a reasonable simulation of normal interior light.
measuring 92.6 x 71.0 x 27.0 mm (3.65 x 2.8 x 1 in), the dsc-f77 has about the same dimensions as the credit card sizedcasio exilim ex-s2 that was previously at the top of my list (admittedly the sony camera is significantly thicker but it’s still a light, pocketable camera).
but the reviews all had a consistent theme: innovative design, marvellously compact for its feature set, disappointing image quality.
we drafted a flyer and posted it on all the notice boards in the department.
but, taken together, they reveal a number of problems: there is no easy way to turn the lcd screen on and off the 4-way selector switch on the back is too small to be operated easily with a finger tip the power button and the shutter release are so close together that it’s easy to turn the camera off when you try to take a picture.
according to the accepted formula the outside landscape should be about twice as bright as the interior: otherwise the images seen through the windows would look like pictures on the wall.
looking back, i’m astonished that i got away with the subterfuge.
it’s as though curators, desperate to include some women from that period in the documentary pantheon, had to settle for work which, had it been done by a man, would have been regarded as competent but undistinguished.
i like the idea of doing it in public; it will be like having advance reviewers.
for a few weeks, the students were bereft.
i realize it’s time to read this extraordinary book again.

in the case of the picture opposite, the photographer evidently miscalculated a little, but the picture is surely more interesting as it is than it would be if naturalistically correct.
rather, i saw the postmodernist position not as a personal affront but as rigid, unimaginative, and inappropriate for young students with a relatively constrained view of what could be possible in life and in art.
all of us, even the best-mannered of us, occasionally point, and it must be true that some of us point to more interesting facts, events, circumstances, and configurations than others.
the little towns, the county seats, house by house white-painted and elaborately sawn among their heavy and dark-lighted leaves, in the spaced protections of their mineral light they stand so prim, so voided, so undefended upon starlight, that it is inconceivable to despise or to scorn a white man, an owner of land; even in birmingham, mile on mile, save for the sudden frightful streaming, almost instantly diminished and silent, of a closed black car, and save stone lonesome sinister heelbeats, that show never a face and enter, soon, a frame door flush with the pavement, and ascend the immediate lightless staircase, mile on mile, stone, stone, smooth charted streams of stone, the streets under their lifted lamps lie void before eternity.
i was so taken by the “honeymoon” photograph (at left) that i tracked down a copy of the japan book viaabebooks.com and just received an email from the merchant to say that they’ll ship it to me today.
i’ll check one out the next time i’m near a camera store.

with a digital camera, the image coming through the lens appears on the lcd screen.
the students lost most of all.
so it was a surprise and a delight to be introduced to whitman through the poem that closed doc’s entry on wednesday.
although there’s no optical viewfinder, it uses aaa batteries and memory sticks (of which i already have three).
like jeff, i was captivated by the intellectual challenge of transforming chaotic three-dimensional space into a cohesive flat plane.
better still, i might have continued to teach happily at the university instead of resigning my tenured position, splitting up with the lovely woman i’d been seeing for a couple of years, and abandoning photography, thus diving headlong into a midlife crisis.
over the sixteen week semester, i’d show 21 photographers (11 whose work i loved, and 10 whose work i thought was important but didn’t much like at all).
i approached photography much the same way, experimenting with everything except fabricated tableaus.
szarkowski writes in the accompanying text: bourke-while had an excellent sense of simple, poster-like design, and a sophisticated photographic technique, both perhaps the legacy of her apprenticeship in the demanding field of industrial reportage.
although this bore little resemblance to my original proposal, i wasn’t troubled, since i’d always believed that art can’t be made to a formula but invariably takes on a life of its own, that it is possible to exert a fine degree of control over a project without necessarily knowing where one is headed.

when you press the shutter release, the camera finds focus and the shutter closes (the image then freezes on the lcd screen), then the shutter is released.
the viewfinder showed a fraction less but i loved the square frame, the 2¼ negative, the solidthwump of the shutter and mirror, and—above all—the sense of control.
looking at photographs, i nearly fell over, captivated by the way that bourke-white had (perhaps accidentally) achieved a perfect balance between the interior flash and the external daylight, pulling everything into a single plane.
the two kindly old people sit in a room that is hermetically sealed with illusions.
i suggest that the bitterness of the canon wars, and so much else in academic literary studies, has had a great deal to do with the kind of people who become english professors.
the plow handles are wet, and the rails and the frogplates and the weeds between the ties: and not even the hurryings and hoarse sorrows of a distant train, on other roads, is heard.
this can take up to a second and a half (less if you prefocus, but if the subject then moves you can’t be sure that you’ve focused accurately).
permalink i imagine my “overdetermined revulsion” (as akma might put it) for architects results from never having met one i liked.
the roads lie there, with nothing to use them.
finally, at the beginning of a new school year, i suggested to the other instructors a strategy for addressing the problem.
the photographs they made were marvellous.
you see, in a few weeks i have to start writing a a book.

whenever dorothea salo writes about graduate school, i’m reminded of the university where i taught photography and managed to complete an ma in visual arts.
my supervisor never commented on the “real work” though i heard from reliable sources that she hated it.
i feel much better dealing with something i’m comfortable with.
according to the accepted formula the outside landscape should be about twice as bright as the interior: otherwise the images seen through the windows would look like pictures on the wall.
it’s impossible to shoot fluidly with anything but a digital slr (where the image is deflected by the mirror through the reflex prism to the viewfinder).
it read: for this semester, the following subjects are declared off-limits to first-year photography students: - closeups of bark on tree trunks - shadows cast by sunlight streaming though a blind - grizzled old men with silvery whiskers - coils of wet rope on sand - toddlers with ice cream smeared on their faces - nudes - grainy pictures printed on high contrast paper - portraits in which the subject stares at the camera - slow exposures of water running over rocks - unmade beds these subjects have been photographed so much over the past few years that they are exhausted and in need of a holiday.
just as jeff suggested, it’s a real find: beautifully constructed photographs of everyday life in postwar japan in fourteen individual portfolios.
i’ve been composing all manner of texts, excepting fiction.
as ray puts it: the resolution is perfectly fine for on-screen viewing, it has a great flash, it has ample capacity when used with a 128mb memory card, it beats out even the blackberry in terms of its battery life (weeks), and best of all, it boots and is ready to snap a picture in sub-one-second.
now there are fewer clashes within cutting-edge english departments, because nearly everyone is a theorist or cultural-studies specialist.
the course is “extended topics in nonfiction” and the quantity of writing involved will be massive.
jeff ward learned to write because he wanted to talk online about the pictures he was making.
i resigned and started working in multimedia and then web development, not unlike mark krupnick, who jumped ship to teach religious studies.
the victors don’t always present a pretty picture.
the disappointment that propels them from woman to woman gives their inconstancy a kind of romantic excuse, so that many sentimental women are touched by their unbridled philandering.
we expect to see them back, refreshed and enthusiastic, in six months time.

permalink | comments (0) permalink | comments (0) jeff ward at visible darkness was surprised to learn that in 1990 bakersfield, where he grew up, was the 97th largest city in the us and little rock, where he currently resides, was 96th.
most of all i loved the idea that pictures could touch people’s hearts and change their lives.
though i started out with jeff’s and loren’s sentimentality posts in the back of my mind, the teaching experience pushed to the foreground.
the picture thatjeff reproduced from bristol’s korea book is terrific too—though i prefer the unashamedly “staged” quality of the japanese photograph.
bourke-while became very skillful at this technique, which required especially delicate calculation when the level of the interior flash had to be balanced against the level of natural light visible through a room’s windows.
the picture thatjeff reproduced from bristol’s korea book is terrific too—though i prefer the unashamedly “staged” quality of the japanese photograph.
so, when dorothea attacks academia and jeff defends it, it seems to me that they are each describing different aspects of the same institution, since universities are just as subject to sturgeon’s law (“ninety percent of everything is crud”) as every other area of human endeavor.
the size impressed me immediately—one disadvantage of the sony is that it’s just too big to take with meeverywhere.
this can take up to a second and a half (less if you prefocus, but if the subject then moves you can’t be sure that you’ve focused accurately).
every day in the hospital i experienced moments of unimaginable happiness as well as periods of the deepest distress.
in the book, sabina (tomas’s mistress) encourages tereza (his wife) to become a photographer, lending her “three or four monographs of famous photographers” and explaining “what made each of the photographs interesting.”
either way, if you’re successful, the end result is the same: slightly less crud, though i doubt—given our moral and intellectual frailty—that we’ll ever radically alter sturgeon’s ratio of 90:10.
and, that though they may not look like journalism, they sure as hell feel like art.
the shutter lag isn’t appreciable, i can imagine taking it with me everywhere, and the 2-megapixel resolution is a lot more appealing.
i don’t know whether the system was particularly slack in those days but when i commenced the ma the emphasis was firmly on art practice: my obligations were to make photographs, write regular progress reports, meet occasionally with a supervisor, and present the finished work in a gallery where it would be judged by independent assessors.
in first year it’s common for photo students to try all kinds of wacky “techniques” as they regurgitate every hackneyed picture they’ve ever seen.
okay, so sydney is twice the size of la… that wasn’t the point.
i found it, along with two photo booth pictures that i’d put there for safe keeping, then promptly forgotten.
i know i yearned for those photographic values which started with walker evans and finished with robert frank and had fallen into disrepute.
he was the first to teach me how, by carefully balancing interior and exterior illumination, you could totally flatten three-dimensional space.
what some might characterize as a performance of breathtaking dishonesty and cynicism was to me a strategy for survival—for which, as it happened, i was more than adequately equipped.
doc’s genius lies in the way he builds his argument carefully and concludes it gracefully by pointing to whitman’s poem.
possibly i accepted the fact that i’d done the best i was capable of and it was better to walk away and begin anew.
i’d bring a batch of “new pictures” for her to critique whilst i poured all my time, energy, and passion into photographing at the hospital.
more importantly, after three years as a member of the visual arts board (the australian equivalent of thenea), i was neither shocked nor surprised by the duplicity of art politics.

i’m also willing to admit—having encountered a variety of smart, engaging academics amongst the faculty of u blog—that not everyone who works in a university is either a cynical opportunist, a ruthless careerist, or a time-serving hack.
in order to be heard, they rearrange the language they inherit into something that is unique to them.
every day i saw ordinary people, faced with appalling misfortune, behave with the most extraordinary courage and dignity.
if the casio had a resolution of two megapixels instead of one, i’d buy it immediately.
although there’s no optical viewfinder, it uses aaa batteries and memory sticks (of which i already have three).
for me though, no-one holds a candle to walker evans.
so english professors tend to experience alternative approaches to the truth as they see it as a personal affront, and cause for counterattack.
i used also to loathe post-modernists and post-structuralists, for the way they ripped the heart out of art practice, taking something i loved almost as much as life itself, and trampling it into a noxious slurry concocted from fear, ambition, hatred, french theory, and pc claptrap mixed with generous portions of their own shit, piss, and vomit.
the course is “extended topics in nonfiction” and the quantity of writing involved will be massive.
if i’d listened to her unbiased advice, if i’d been able to put aside my pathological distaste for art theory, if i’d been really open to experience… i could have created a work of far greater depth and complexity.
i’m sure this includes north little rock, just across the river, which is a fairly substantial place.
i learned to write and kept practising.

it is an engine that creates difference from uniformity.
when i taught the history of 20th century photography, the classes devoted to model and levitt were invariably well-received—particularly by students who’d assumed that diane arbus was the only important woman photographer.
as soon as the salesman realized i was a serious buyer, he switched into upsell mode and showed meminolta dimage x, a 2-megapixel model with a 3x optical zoom (the 1-megapixel casio has a fixed focus 5.6mm wide angle lens).
i’ll use the blog to string it together first.
i just found our itinerary folded in the back of the copy oflet us now praise famous men that i carried with me.
my former supervisor would tell the story differently—and, for some readers (or many), her version might be equally persuasive.
the photographs were well-received, the reviews were enthusiastic, the show would tour to other galleries, the assessors were impressed.
what makes the photo booth pictures (formally) interesting is that they are framed as mirror images, except that the women have changed places so that each appears in the foreground of one photo and the background of another.
every day in the hospital i experienced moments of unimaginable happiness as well as periods of the deepest distress.
i went to the city to buymocha coffee tim tams and check out the casio ex-s1 which, contrary tomy expectations, was very comfortable to use (given that it’s hardly bigger than a credit card).
their moralism strikes me as being at odds with their obsession with intradepartmental power plays and their rapt attention to new fashions in criticism and whatever will advance their careers.

it is novel in its arrangement, but not in its themes.
more importantly, the combination of four megapixels and a carl zeiss lens ensures that the sony’s image quality will eat that of the casio, or the minolta dimage x. trust sony.
the real interest is, however, in the pair rather than the single images; in the juxtaposition of two portraits of two women, happily mugging for a camera without an operator, as it records a tiny sliver of “the endless variety of the objective female world.”
it has a fixed focus 5.6mm/f2.5 lens (equivalent to 37mm on 35mm camera).
i’ll check one out the next time i’m near a camera store.
i loved the fact that it was difficult and i could do it.
it’s hardly surprising that i’ve constructed myself as the (flawed) hero of this narrative.
the obsession of the latter is epic, and women see nothing the least bit touching in it: the man projects no subjective ideal on women, and since everything interests him, nothing can disappoint him.
yet my only concern was that photography students use their cameras to engage their world with passion and commitment—for me, photography was a primarily a method for exploring ideas and emotions.
it’s as though curators, desperate to include some women from that period in the documentary pantheon, had to settle for work which, had it been done by a man, would have been regarded as competent but undistinguished.
references to thomas browne’s father being a silk merchant; the purple piece of silk in the urn of patroculus; the silken ropes given to hsien-feng’s viceroys so that they may hang themselves, an act of benevolence as their sentence decreed that they …be dismembered and sliced into slices.
the american photographer berenice abbott rescued an enormous cache of his negatives from neglect and possible destruction.

both are generally enthusiastic: about the camera’s tiny size, its acceptable (not great) image quality, and range of manual functions.
first, starting with the invasion of french poststructuralism in the 1960s, advanced literary interpretation changed from being formalist in method and traditionalist in ideology to a brand of french theory whose major distinguishing characteristic seemed to be that it required you to spend more time reading the theorists than reading the canonical texts of western literature.
i’d bring a batch of “new pictures” for her to critique whilst i poured all my time, energy, and passion into photographing at the hospital.
i think i’ll hold back to see how jeff approaches the activity but ever since he broached the subject my sleeping patterns have been shot to pieces too.
but i hadn’t heard of bristol and certainly didn’t know that he had collaborated with john steinbeck; nor was i aware of his japan and korea photographs.
i enjoyed sloshing around with chemicals, the solitude of the darkroom, the beauty and precision of expensive cameras, the physicality of taking pictures (requiring a kind of athletic grace more akin to sports than making art).
finally, at the beginning of a new school year, i suggested to the other instructors a strategy for addressing the problem.

an hour of lies a month was inconsequential compared with the truth i encountered every day in the ward.
how dr so-and-so from the art theory department had told her that feelings were a bourgeois illusion, that she should work to embed in her photographs references to key theorists.
i knew instinctively that my project would be anathema, that her enervated theorizing applied to the raw emotion of my pictures could only harm me and the work.
i’m convinced the best blogs owe much of their power to such an art of graceful pointing.

it is not difficult to imagine a person—a mute virgil of the corporeal world—who might elevate the act of pointing to a creative plane, a person who would lead us through the fields and streets and indicate a sequence of phenomena and aspects that would be beautiful, humorous, morally instructive, cleverly ordered, mysterious, or astonishing, once brought to our attention, but that had been unseen before, or seen dumbly, without comprehension.

a greater negative, however, is the sony’s shutter lag, an unfortunate “feature” of most digital cameras.

this talented practitioner of the new discipline (the discipline a cross, perhaps, between theater and criticism) would perform with a special grace, sense of timing, narrative sweep, and wit, thus endowing the act not merely with intelligence, but with that quality of formal rigor that identifies a work of art, so that we would be uncertain, when remembering the adventure of the tour, how much of our pleasure and sense of enlargement had come from the things pointed to and how much from a pattern created by the pointer.

it read: for this semester, the following subjects are declared off-limits to first-year photography students: closeups of bark on tree trunks shadows cast by sunlight streaming though a blind grizzled old men with silvery whiskers coils of wet rope on sand toddlers with ice cream smeared on their faces nudes grainy pictures printed on high contrast paper portraits in which the subject stares at the camera slow exposures of water running over rocks unmade beds these subjects have been photographed so much over the past few years that they are exhausted and in need of a holiday.
i went to the city to buymocha coffee tim tams and check out the casio ex-s1 which, contrary tomy expectations, was very comfortable to use (given that it’s hardly bigger than a credit card).
since i’d always been prolific, exposing thousands of negatives, year after year, my three months worth of garden photographs looked like at least two years work.
even had i wanted to, there was no point in staging a counterattack.
my former supervisor would tell the story differently—and, for some readers (or many), her version might be equally persuasive.
i never photographed without permission and was acutely sensitive to every agonizing nuance.
my supervisor never commented on the “real work” though i heard from reliable sources that she hated it.
for many parents, i had created a record of their child’s struggle towards recovery and their responses to that struggle; for a lonely few, my photographs are the only tangible evidence of their baby’s brief existence.
and because i was relentlessly self-critical, these rejected images would easily have gained me the ma.
corollary 1: the existence of immense quantities of trash in science fiction is admitted and it is regrettable; but it is no more unnatural than the existence of trash anywhere.
a greater negative, however, is the sony’s shutter lag, an unfortunate “feature” of most digital cameras.
this is a marvellous idea for a book and, given how much i’ve learned from jeff’s ideas about walker evans, i can’t wait to read the book as it takes shape since jeff is ideally qualified to write about the documentary photography of that (or any other) era.
[tereza] felt a rush of admiration for sabina, and because sabina treated her as a friend it was an admiration free of fear and suspicion and quickly turned into friendship.
so, when dorothea attacks academia and jeff defends it, it seems to me that they are each describing different aspects of the same institution, since universities are just as subject to sturgeon’s law (“ninety percent of everything is crud”) as every other area of human endeavor.
the result is a work of maddening, frightful inspiration, a masterpiece by any standards but a masterpiece that parades its flaws with poignant, nearly tragic recklessness.
mature silkworms being placed on trays i collected horace bristol’s japan (recommended by jeff ward)
worse still, the camera doesn’t the memorize flash mode after power off, a major disadvantage for someone whonever, ever takes pictures with flash.
and because i was relentlessly self-critical, these rejected images would easily have gained me the ma.
now there are fewer clashes within cutting-edge english departments, because nearly everyone is a theorist or cultural-studies specialist.
given that documentary photographs are never transparently truthful, but invariably constructed, i admire pictures that acknowledge the fundamental dishonesty that lies at their core, even as they pretend to depict “reality.”
it’s hardly surprising that i’ve constructed myself as the (flawed) hero of this narrative.
again jeff nails it: the real stuff happens at the edges, and i wanted control.
though i started out with jeff’s and loren’s sentimentality posts in the back of my mind, the teaching experience pushed to the foreground.
about 50% more expensive than the casio, the dimage x makes a great first impression.
sebald liberally sprinkles references to silk throughout the book, as an adult would sprinkle clues for a child at an easter egg hunt.
baby-boom and younger academics in english often project a sanctimony about their secular political-cultural convictions that i never see when my divinity school colleagues touch on their religious beliefs.
the obsession of the epic womanizer strikes people as lacking in redemption (redemption by disappointment).
steve himmer suggests a reason: i wonder if it’s an issue of students having the poetic tools they’ve absorbed from the canon—the nature imagery, weather, etc.—but not cutting close enough with them to the experiences they’re trying to represent.
i realize now how i imposed my prejudices on the students but at least they were clearly stated.
i had commenced photographing in the neonatal intensive care unit of the children’s hospital in sydney and thought a computer might bring some order to my unwieldy project.
measuring 92.6 x 71.0 x 27.0 mm (3.65 x 2.8 x 1 in), the dsc-f77 has about the same dimensions as the credit card sizedcasio exilim ex-s2 that was previously at the top of my list (admittedly the sony camera is significantly thicker but it’s still a light, pocketable camera).
i showed the pictures—the best work i had ever done—atwatters gallery in august 1987 to general, though not universal, acclaim.
she was excited by the new opportunities presented by photoflash bulbs, which made possible clear and highly detailed pictures under circumstances that would otherwise have been difficult or impossible for photography.
the use of two or three bulbs, synchronized to flash together as the shutter was released, could produce a reasonable simulation of normal interior light.
whereas once i regarded pomo theory (and theorists) with revulsion, as a consequence of reading akma’s and jeff’s weblogs over the past year, i’m more open to viewing the world through theoretical (rather than purely experiential) eyes.
but little rock still has something close to a small town mentality, though i confess that it’s actually less “hickish” than bakersfield… just for giggles, i had to look up the figures for canberra—313,000 according to the tourist web site.
it has a fixed focus 5.6mm/f2.5 lens (equivalent to 37mm on 35mm camera).
for all of its supposed faults,let us now praise famous men remains one of my favorite books.
i knew instinctively that my project would be anathema, that her enervated theorizing applied to the raw emotion of my pictures could only harm me and the work.
nevertheless, i remain interested: the tiny size and no shutter lag make it an ideal point-and-shoot camera while the 1-megapixel (960x1280) image is more than sufficient for web display, asjeff’s image gallery proves (steve, inexplicably, took most of his gallery pictures at the interpolated 1200x1600 resolution, so that most of them look soft).
in first year it’s common for photo students to try all kinds of wacky “techniques” as they regurgitate every hackneyed picture they’ve ever seen.
we traveled through the south, visiting most of the places walker evans photographed as well as many of the towns where robert frank had taken pictures forthe americans.
as ray puts it: the resolution is perfectly fine for on-screen viewing, it has a great flash, it has ample capacity when used with a 128mb memory card, it beats out even the blackberry in terms of its battery life (weeks), and best of all, it boots and is ready to snap a picture in sub-one-second.
i’m also willing to admit—having encountered a variety of smart, engaging academics amongst the faculty of u blog—that not everyone who works in a university is either a cynical opportunist, a ruthless careerist, or a time-serving hack.
it’s only recently i’ve realized that she could well have been precisely the right supervisor for someone else, an insight that depended on both the passing of time and my “meeting” a couple of post-modernists and/or post-structuralists i like and respect.
the james bond spy camera frustrated with my current digital camera (a sony dsc-s70), i followed a link fromscripting news to ray ozzie’s weblog, where he sings the praises of thecasio exilim ex-s1, “the best camera [ray] ever owned.”
in doing so, i learned that my only loyalty was to the individuals
every day i saw ordinary people, faced with appalling misfortune, behave with the most extraordinary courage and dignity.
so those standard devices are rendered unable to stand in for anything except what they actually are.
given that documentary photographs are never transparently truthful, but invariably constructed, i admire pictures that acknowledge the fundamental dishonesty that lies at their core, even as they pretend to depict “reality.”
steve himmer suggests a reason: i wonder if it’s an issue of students having the poetic tools they’ve absorbed from the canon—the nature imagery, weather, etc.—but not cutting close enough with them to the experiences they’re trying to represent.
as soon as the salesman realized i was a serious buyer, he switched into upsell mode and showed meminolta dimage x, a 2-megapixel model with a 3x optical zoom (the 1-megapixel casio has a fixed focus 5.6mm wide angle lens).
better still, i might have continued to teach happily at the university instead of resigning my tenured position, splitting up with the lovely woman i’d been seeing for a couple of years, and abandoning photography, thus diving headlong into a midlife crisis.
the shutter lag isn’t appreciable, i can imagine taking it with me everywhere, and the 2-megapixel resolution is a lot more appealing.
a month later, i showed her another five or six photographs, sprinkling a fine dust of theory over the prints as i explained how i’d put her advice into practice.
first, starting with the invasion of french poststructuralism in the 1960s, advanced literary interpretation changed from being formalist in method and traditionalist in ideology to a brand of french theory whose major distinguishing characteristic seemed to be that it required you to spend more time reading the theorists than reading the canonical texts of western literature.
again he could be writing about what happened in the art school: the baby boomers have prevailed.

i guess i’ll have to keep looking—though the features i’m after may just be too idiosyncratic.
maybe my disaffection sprang from a conviction that television had rendered photography almost irrelevant, a process only hastened by its elevation to the status of an art.
yet my only concern was that photography students use their cameras to engage their world with passion and commitment—for me, photography was a primarily a method for exploring ideas and emotions.
whereas joe pointed out—and i picked up on—the connection between sentimentality and brutality in warblogging posts, loren and jeff argued for sentimentality as a valid human response to lived experience (jeff would use sentiment as a synonym for feeling).
in the case of the picture opposite, the photographer evidently miscalculated a little, but the picture is surely more interesting as it is than it would be if naturalistically correct.
the size impressed me immediately—one disadvantage of the sony is that it’s just too big to take with meeverywhere.
she was excited by the new opportunities presented by photoflash bulbs, which made possible clear and highly detailed pictures under circumstances that would otherwise have been difficult or impossible for photography.
resolution, so that most of them look soft).
references to thomas browne’s father being a silk merchant; the purple piece of silk in the urn of patroculus; the silken ropes given to hsien-feng’s viceroys so that they may hang themselves, an act of benevolence as their sentence decreed that they …be dismembered and sliced into slices.
sebald liberally sprinkles references to silk throughout the book, as an adult would sprinkle clues for a child at an easter egg hunt.
in order to be heard, they rearrange the language they inherit into something that is unique to them.
i think i’ll hold back to see how jeff approaches the activity but ever since he broached the subject my sleeping patterns have been shot to pieces too.
it think there is a synergy between text and image that is rarely explored, let alone exploited to full advantage.
you see, in a few weeks i have to start writing a a book.
i never photographed without permission and was acutely sensitive to every agonizing nuance.
when i looked more closely, i realized she bore an uncanny resemblance toayako.
both are generally enthusiastic: about the camera’s tiny size, its acceptable (not great) image quality, and range of manual functions.
worse still, the camera doesn’t the memorize flash mode after power off, a major disadvantage for someone whonever, ever takes pictures with flash.
the students lost most of all.
fifteen years ago i quit a well-paid, tenured, enjoyable position as a lecturer in photography in a university art school because i no longer had the energy or inclination to argue with the ideologues who had taken control.
