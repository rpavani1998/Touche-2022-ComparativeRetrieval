the blue mop though stands out too much from the rest (slightly used and has even a bar code on it) even with slight desaturation.
both good shots, i just like the "feel" of the b&w better.

the colours give an "earthy" feel (in colours) to the image, but i think that the blue mop, red thing on the floor and the green tie around the brush don't fit with the rest of the image.
as is, i prefer the b&w but would vote for the colour if it gets adjusted logged http://hopkinsfoto.com 1dsiii, 5dii | 200l f2.0 is | 135l f2 | 85l f1.2 | 35l f1.4 | 70-200l f2.8  | 24-70l f2.8 | 16-35l f2.8 | 24-105l f4 | 15mm fish f2.8 insane in the membrane
mainly because the color version seems to be a "rustic" shot, but the blue plastic mop and the red plastic dust pan or whatever it is give it a posed or contrived feel.
the nice thing about digital work is that we can retain all of the versions on the table.

i like the color, but i would cut back on the vignetting.

it is only through challenge that we can survive, if you can no longer challenge yourself, you have reached your end.
this is the reason i made another version in mono to blend the blue mop.
