paired up with the expeed 2 image processing engine, the d7000 also boasts nikon's latest hardware for speedy processing and the capability to expand the already well-specified iso 100-6400 sensitivity to a top-end hi2 setting - the equivalent of iso 25,600.
to store your images there are twin sd card slots that can be utilised simultaneously or user-defined to operate in an overflow or stills/video format.
it's interesting to see the omission of a cf card slot, which seems to now be exclusively reserved for more pro-grade models.
the nikon d7000 adopts a new 16.2-megapixel cmos sensor, suggesting that the megapixel count for dslr cameras is clearly still on the rise.
and there didn't seem to be an easy way of metering when in video mode.
i have a question do you think the d7000 is better than the d3 ash hi ashley i have not used the d3 so i am not really the right person to ask but to my mind the d3 is a professional camera and the d7000 is a top end amateur.
it's not just still images where the nikon d7000 comes well equipped either: the ability to capture full hd 1080p video at 24 frames per second sees off much of the competition thanks to its progressive capture.
the rear of the camera has a fixed 3in, 920k-dot lcd screen and a viewfinder sat above this gives a full 100% field-of-view to ensure that exactly what you frame by eye is what you capture.
i used the d7000 for 10 days solid, over 2000 frames, in a mix of urban, landscape, and wildlife settings, which revealed a different side to the camera.
it doesn't let the camera perform anywhere near as well as it should.
there seems to be no way of adjusting the apeture when in video ("live view") mode, even if the camera's in manual mode.
i would say the d3 with the same lens is a tad crisper due to the full frame sensor but in low light the d7000 is almost identical & on a gallery wall unless they are side by side at a3+ the difference takes enough working out to make (imo) the d7000 a good choice up to serious club or exhibition level i've had a d7000 for about a year.
with brand new autofocus and metering systems this release is the first to see the latest 16.2mp sensor and is far from nikon resting on its laurels.
there wouldnt be an issue if nikon were half decent and charged £50 for it.
i have had a d7000 for a few months now for a replacement to the d80, it was expensive, but it is worth every penny, they have really thought of everything, even being able to take stadard ai lenses and still give auto exposure, so all my old nikon and tamron ai lenses work great, so i tend to use my old nikor 1.4 50mm lens for fantastic image quality, i canr really fault this camera
pros: fantastic af system, excellent picture quality, great battery life cons: a little expensive, screen could be higher resolution, kit lens doesn’t show camera’s full potential since its announcement earlier this year, the nikon d7000 has set tongues wagging from the word go.
elsewhere there's an all-new 2,016 pixel rgb metering module and a brand new 39-point af system with nine cross-type sensors, dubbed the multi-cam 4800dx.
your test wasn't as thorough as a magazine of your reputation merits.
i bought one after reading the reviews of a great nikon that's new on the block.
if you get one remember it takes some time to really know these cameras very comprehensive control system and how to get the best from them.
anyone who buys this camera for videos was clearly born in a test tube and related to the wombles .....

being a nikon user since my f2 in 1960 i am biased because in all those years not once was i let down.
d7000 pick mono sound, less than 48 khz.
going to test it with the ed 700-300 mm in 10 shots or captures if you prefer i got 2 publications in the press.
for those looking to reel off bursts of images in continuous shooting mode, the d7000 offers a pleasing 6fps.
with brand new autofocus and metering systems this release is the first to see the latest 16.2mp sensor and is far from nikon resting on its laurels.
my standard lens is the good old 50mm 1.8 that on the d7000 produces razor sharp images even at 200% crop i am well pleased with this camera and think i made a good choice in buying despite as many believe to be a slightly high price its still one heck of a good camera.
the user 1&2 settings are a real bonus compared to my old d200 as is the rear as well as front remote ir sensor, great for tripod/macro work specially when the double action mirror up then shoot setting is selected.
it's still a disappointing camera given what nikon could have done for the price.

hog wash, look at the pictures dont go hunt the spot, i'll print 10 16x20's and i bet you wont be able to point out one hot pix.
it's interesting to see the omission of a cf card slot, which seems to now be exclusively reserved for more pro-grade models.
you need to remove the battery door on the d7000 which is done by opening it to about 30 degrees and wiggling it off.
in addition, nikon are stingy with their firmware updates.
the aps-c size of the sensor means the usual 1.5x magnification applies (i.e. 18mm is the same as 27mm in a full-frame 35mm equivalent).
indeed, to dispel the myth of it being a d90 replacement, it's worth pointing out that both cameras will continue to run in the current nikon range for the time being and the gap between one and the next is fairly considerable.
otherwise, it's a good camera.
these new nikons are rather tempting your test feels like a quick and superficial review.
for a crop sensor dslr yes, but its one hell of a good camera, i should know i have had one long enough to get to know it properly, not a quick one of two day play around and after best part of 40 years shooting pictures with every thing from a minnox b to a rb67 to a canon 1d i reakon i know a duffer when i see one.
overall, the d7000 was released too early and needs a firmware upgrade to af, metering and video sound.
kodachrome with slightly muted colours and wonderful subtle tones.
i'll go with nearly everything you said, i cant say i have had much problem with the metering although it may just be i have not shot in the same conditions as yourself but should it arise i am sure a little bit of practice to recognise the conditions and compensate will be no problem.
i resolved this by adding a battery grip the sensor is quite advanced at the price.
it's pulled from analysing the file straight from camera.
keep in mind that nikon still allows you a worldwide guarantee on their lenses so u can shop for a 18-200 vr2 on ebay from america for £435 etc.

the camera is tremendous.

i bought the nikon d7000 a few days ago but got it with the nikon 18-200mm vr2 lens ..
i bought just the body as i have always been dubious about kit bundles & not ever using the 105 zoom looks like a wise move on my part.
ipc media limited, owner of whatdigitalcamera.co.uk, will collect your personal information solely to process your request.
the af system is easily confused in still mode, and generally poor in video mode.
the d7000 is absolutely the best aps-c dslr, and the 18-105mm kit lens is a joy to use.
its like buying a ferrari and then crying because you can beat michael schumacher in his ferrari.
and nikon hasn't made enough kits with the 18-200 available, which might make it a better performer.
i usually dial in exposure compensation.
i ordered the battery grip for the nikon d90 for £24.45 and cut off the plastic connector that goes inside the battery compartment on the d90 and filed it down to about 3mm and filed the other end flat were it curved up and attached a rubber gasket between the grip and the camera.
£230 is daylight robbery.
for now i have the looks of the proper grip for less than £25 and when copies are made in a few months i will buy one so all the features on the grip work with the camera.
selling the d7000 as a kit with the 18-105 is a stupid mistake by nikon.
the poor af on video doesn't depend much on the lens.
this camera does overexpose in bright conditions.
the aps-c size of the sensor means the usual 1.5x magnification applies (i.e. 18mm is the same as 27mm in a full-frame 35mm equivalent).
the d7000 can produce exhbition quality images, what it cant do is compose the picture
great camera, intuitive menu and controls.
i couldn't find 1080p 25fps as an option in the menu.
it doesn't let the camera perform anywhere near as well as it should."
the af is super fast running with the 18-200 vr you can go from camera off to picture taken in just over a second.
for those looking to reel off bursts of images in continuous shooting mode, the d7000 offers a pleasing 6fps.
they should give it a 5 shot hdr capability and the ability to shoot hd video at 30fps.
"the d7000 uses linear pcm (essentially the carrier format as found in compact disc audio), with a 16bit stereo, 48000hz sample rate."
the rear of the camera has a fixed 3in, 920k-dot lcd screen and a viewfinder sat above this gives a full 100% field-of-view to ensure that exactly what you frame by eye is what you capture.
your comments will be recorded, but you might not be benefiting all the features.
no camera is perfect but to date i have yet to find anything that has made me regret it's purchase the d700 stays at home it's that good for samples go to www.flickr.com/photos/birdseyeviewphotos look at the swan pics.
all i can say its a cracker, all the twaddle i have read running it down seems to come from people who have not a. given themselves time to learn exactly how to get the best from it or b. people who cut and paste from comments in catagory a. this is a great little dslr used right with a decent lens it produces well exposed pin sharp images.
the d7000 + the kit lens and the 35mm lens is a killer system without breaking the bank.
considered in the context against the nikon d300s's 7fps, and side by side to the canon 60d's 5.3fps, this is a well-specified offering that will prove tempting to those enthusiasts looking for speed as well as resolution and all-round capability.
most professional gear i have tried is built to take a bashing but you have to pay for that build quality and of course the d3 is a full frame although now a bit long in the tooth if i was a professional between the 2 i would go for the d3 as i would need that reliability, but having said that i have noticed a number of pro nikon users are starting to carry the d7000 as a backup or snatch shot camera .
i can buy the superb 35mm/f1.8 lens with the money saved and with plenty of cash left!
the nikon d7000 adopts a new 16.2-megapixel cmos sensor, suggesting that the megapixel count for dslr cameras is clearly still on the rise.
and i suspect some purchasers thought their snaps would somehow change into great compositions just by buying a new camera & when it didnt they got upset.
i have found that it could have been a fraction bigger but if you have not been used to a larger camera it would not be a problem.
however, this test does point out that the lens is a let down.
a bit of patients and you will get great results stick it on auto and it will be just another dslr, decent enough images but way below the real abilities of these great lttle cameras.

i have had my d7000 since november so i feel i can write with some knowledge of this camera.

set the cameras image control to vivid and fujichromes hard greens & reds springs out at you.
the 3mm of base height and the connecting screw which goes into the base of the d7000 secures it fine and the rubber protects the camera and forms additional grip.
the 18-105 lens has a plastic connection to the camera so that was a no-no.
i cant believe people are actually bothered about video on a camera like that.
yes, it's a phenomenal camera, in my opinion priced lower than what you'd expect.
