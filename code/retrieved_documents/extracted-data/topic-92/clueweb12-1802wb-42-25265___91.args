laboratories can provide a live spore count which is the best measure of inoculum quality.
this strategy assures that nutrients are available when the seedlings actually need them, not before.
the rock ripper is a common tool found on most construction sites.
in the field, for direct seeding applications, the slurry of commercial or crude inoculant can be added to the hydroseeder tank and mixed in with seed mixes.
the amount of mulch applied depends on the objective.
there may be a minimum topsoil depth below which the application of topsoil is not effective.
the period of time that nitrogen remains immobilized in the soil is dependent on several factors: it is not easy to predict how long nitrogen will be immobilized in a soil.
the most direct method for monitoring soil shatter is to measure the depth to the compacted soil with a soil penetrometer or shovel (seesection 5.3.3.1).
this method offers a practical alternative to species such as bottlebrush squirreltail (elymus elymoides ) or western needlegrass (achnatherum occidentale) which can be difficult to harvest and clean.
figure 10.48 — illustration of a typical cross-section of a planting island where soil depth is enhanced for tree establishment.
these imprints are substantially larger and deeper than those created by trackwalking, with greater longevity.
approximation method — for a quick approximation of lime application rates, the calculations shown in figure 10.29 and figure 10.30 are used.
incorporation can be accomplished on gentle slope gradients using tillage equipment, such as disks and harrows (seesection 10.1.2, tillage).
a. b. c. d. figure 10.39 — nitrogen-fixing bacteria include rhizobium that forms relationships with plants in the legume family including lupines (a), and clovers (b) and frankia that forms relationships with other non-leguminous plants such as snowbrush ceanothus (c), and mountain-avens (d) .
because nitrogen-fixing plants are often "pioneer" species that are the first to colonize disturbed sites, they are ideal for revegetation or restoration projects.
a. c. d. figure 10.37 — several commercial amf inoculums are available and consist of fungal spores mixed with an inert carrier to aid in application.
the interior of large piles maintain higher temperatures and are usually anaerobic, which can be detrimental to soil microorganisms.
seed placement during mulching — seeds can be sown prior to or during mulch operation.
as discussed in previous sections, it is important to understand the characteristics of the reference site topsoils and try to recreate these conditions after construction.
figure 10.30 — this chart can be used to approximate the liming application rates for disturbed soils.
when an organic source with high c:n is incorporated into the soil, carbon becomes available as an energy source for decomposing soil organisms.
these layers are sources of decomposed and partially decomposed organic matter.
inoculum will be applied in the same operational period as seed application.
because disturbance and exposure to direct sunlight may kill these beneficial fungi, soil inoculation must be done as quickly as possible.
if mulch is applied at a 1-inch depth (134 yd3/ac), it would take between 4 to 5 hours to cover an acre.
the mushrooms under this spruce are the fruiting bodies of a beneficial fungus that has formed mycorrhizae on the roots (b).
if one of the construction objectives is to leave the construction soils in non-compacted condition, the use of trackwalking should be seriously weighed against the long-term impacts to plant establishment and growth.
straw is susceptible to movement with moderate to high winds.
increased vigor and growth — plants with mycorrhizal roots survive and grow better after they are planted out on the project site.
the high temperatures can cause heat damage to stems of young seedlings.
where composted organic materials are applied on the soil surface, the nutrient release rates will be much slower.
placing berms or "plugs" in the terraces at frequent intervals can reduce this potential.
a. b. figure 10.32 — mycorrhizal fungi offer many benefits to the host plant.
these piles include tree boles, bark, branches, and stumps, but must not contain large rocks or other inert materials that can cause wear or damage to the equipment.
stockpiled topsoil has been compared to "diffuse composting systems" (visser, fujikawa, and others 1984) because, under optimum conditions, organic material in the topsoil will compost.
however, straw is the stubble left over after seeds have been harvested from commercial seed or grain crops; hay comes from grass/legume fields usually grown for feed.
reintroducing beneficial microorganisms is therefore a key part of roadside revegetation.
mycorrhizal fungi extend the plant's root system, and extract nutrients and water from the soil.
manufacturers have this information for most inorganic slow release fertilizers, and claassen and hogan (1998) performed tests on organic slow release fertilizers (shown in figure 10.2).
they form nodules on the roots and fixing nitrogen for the plant.
young roots often contain the most active nodules.
when this is the case, topsoil is trucked offsite to larger storage piles.
maintaining the trial for two years showed that california fescue outperformed blue wild rye.
some types of beneficial microorganisms are called "microsymbionts" because they form a symbiotic (mutually beneficial) relationship with plants.
without these bacterial partnerships, plants are not able to make direct use of atmospheric nitrogen.
incorporation can be accomplished on gentle slope gradients using tillage equipment, such as disks and harrows (seesection 10.1.2, tillage).
soil improvement can occur when limited topsoil and organic matter are strategically used to create growing areas with optimum rooting depth (see section 5.3 and section 5.5).
manufactured topsoil is used in gabion walls, crib walls, or other bioengineered structures.
compost — the organic component of manufactured topsoil (see section 10.1.5) is composted materials from of a variety of materials including yard waste materials (grass clippings, leaves, and ground wood of trees and shrubs), sawdust, and biosolids.
cation exchange capacity is directly related to the amount of clay and organic matter present in the soil — the higher the clay or organic matter content, the higher the cec.
making the proper adjustments can lead to greater shatter and more efficient use of tractor equipment.
first year nitrogen release rates for fertilizers are identified with an asterisk were adapted from claassen and hogan (1998).
actual field trials could be installed prior to construction to measure the effects of soil amendments on infiltration.
purchasing straw and hay — the drawbacks to using straw and hay are that these materials can contain seeds from undesirable species, are susceptible to wind movement, have limited application distance, and decompose in a relatively short time compared to other mulches.
figure 10.10 — the subsoiling grapple rake is a quick-mounting attachment to excavating machinery that combines several operations in one: (a) subsoiling with winged tines, (b) soil incorporation with bucket, and (c) removal of rock and slash with grapples (photo courtesy of mike karr, umpqua national forest).
these mulches are popular because of the relative ease of transport and installation.
erosion mats are manufactured blankets or mats designed to increase surface stability and control erosion.
because only partial decomposition has occurred, c:n is lower than fresh organic matter.
again, there is little research on amf inoculation effectiveness on roadside revegetation sites.
a. b. figure 10.31 — many plants rely on symbiotic relationships to survive and grow in nature (a).
needing approximately 33,000 ft2 of gabion wall facing, we prepared the erosion mats by rolling them out on a road surface, applying california fescue (festuca californica), gluing the seeds to the mat, and re-rolling the erosion mats.
in addition, the three types of mycorrhizal fungi have to be inoculated differently.
during topsoil excavation, the litter and duff layers are usually removed with the topsoil.
straw produced from native seed production fields, on the other hand, is desirable if the fields are grown from identified genetic sources and used for projects within the seed transfer zones.
the most effective mulch thicknesses are between 3 to 4 inches (pellett and heleba 1995; ozores-hampton 1998), but thicknesses as low as 1.5 inches have been found to be effective for some small-seeded weed species that need sunlight for germination (penny and neal 2003).
liming materials can be mixed on steep slopes using an excavator.
the fineness of the liming material determines how quickly the ph will change.
fertilizers containing more than one nutrient should be considered if the nutrients contained in these fertilizers are deficient in post-construction soils.
unlike straw, these materials keep their structure or porosity over time, and do not compress with snow or lose fiber strength through decomposition.
the heat generated during composting effectively reduces pathogens, weeds, and insects that may be hazardous to humans and detrimental to reestablishing vegetation.
the disadvantages are that many slow-release fertilizers are bulky, cost more to purchase and apply, and are limited by the type of fertilizer application equipment that can be used.
for example, mulch produced by shredders is long and fibrous (figure 10.18
it is always prudent to check the conductivity of a fertilizer solution being applied over existing vegetation to avoid salt damage.
it must be assumed that if a species of grass or forb is present in a hay field, seeds from these plants will show up in the bales.
incorporation is possible on gentle slopes, but becomes very difficult with increasing slope gradients because of equipment limitations.
if the objective for incorporating organic matter is to increase the soil's available water-holding capacity, the rate of organic matter application should be based on achieving a total available water-holding capacity for the desired vegetation of the project area (setting these targets is discussed in section 5.3).inset 10.5 shows one method of determining relative water-holding capacity of amended soils.
since slow-release fertilizers might not be immediately available, small amounts of fast-release fertilizers can be added to give immediate release of nutrients.
while it is not the job of the revegetation specialist to walk the tops of cuts and fills to determine whether concentrated water might flow into areas that are not designed for it, the success of the tillage project might depend on it.
plotting the depths to compaction on graph paper gives a cross-section of the shattering pattern (figure 10.9 is an example of plotting soil shatter).
an excessive amount of phosphorus in the fertilizer inhibits formation of the partnership; therefore phosphorus should be reduced.
straw produced from native seed production fields, on the other hand, is desirable if the fields are grown from identified genetic sources and used for projects within the seed transfer zones.
inoculum can also be made from the spores of mushrooms (b), puffballs, or truffles (c) collected from around the proper host plant.
for example, applying fertilizer at the time of sowing requires very low rates of available nitrogen to meet the first year needs of the establishing vegetation.
where slopes gradients are gentle and free of rock and debris, wood fiber mulch can be evenly applied with a manure spreader.
a small amount of incorporated sawdust will immobilize very little nitrogen as compared to several inches of the same material.
poorly applied erosion mats can result in sheet and rill erosion under the fabric.
also, beneficial bacteria and fungi do not survive in soil in the absence of their host plants and so are killed during soil removal and stockpiling.
the upper portions of steep, extensive slopes are typically not reachable by straw blowers.
application of amf inoculants — because amf spores are relatively large, ensuring that spores come in direct contact with the root systems or seeds is critical.
during the summer or fall, identify plant species and count individual plants in the plots.
the shoots of host plants are removed and the substrate, now rich in roots, spores, and mycelium, is chopped up (figure 10.36b).
this material can come from many sources, such as subsoils, river sands, and terrace deposits.
wood strands are long, thin pieces of wood, produced from wood waste veneer.
contour bench terraces are structures carved out of cut or fill slopes that capture and store runoff water and sediments from road surfaces, road shoulders, and the slopes above.
observing the abundance of root nodules on these plants can give some indication whether they are fixing nitrogen.
there are several mulch materials that carry native seeds, including duff, litter, and straw from native seed production fields.
liming rates are adjusted based on the soil depth to which the lime material is mixed.
for example, erosion control objectives and seed covering objectives go hand-in-hand because the soil surface needs to be stable for seeds to germinate and grow into young seedlings.
using total nitrogen levels from soil tests of topsoil, the application thickness of topsoil can be determined using the calculations presented in figure 10.24.
these figures can then be used to determine the rate of litter to be applied.
mycorrhizal fungi form partnerships with most plant families, and three types of mycorrhizae are recognized: ectomycorrhizal fungi (ecm) have relatively narrow host ranges and form partnerships with many temperate forest plants, especially pines, oaks, beeches, spruces, and firs.
for example, a sandy loam soil has an existing ph of 5.0 (a) and a target ph after liming of ph 6.0 (b).
ericoid mycorrhizal fungi form partnerships with the epacridaceae, empetraceae, and most of the ericaceae; plants affected include blueberries, cranberries, crowberries, huckleberries, azaleas, rhododendrons, and sedges.
non-asterisk fertilizers were based on best guess estimates.
understanding the availability of other nutrients is problematic.
the resulting wood mulch is either placed in piles adjacent to the slash piles or transported to designated storage sites.
application rates depend on factors such as length and diameter of hose, blowing equipment, elevation rise, and dimension of the area being covered.
plant communities dominated by conifers, for instance, function well between ph 5.0 to 6.5, whereas grass-dominated plant communities in arid climates perform well between ph 6.5 and 8.0.
nitrogen-fixing species are usually outplanted in order to help restore fertility and organic matter to the project site.
most release rates were obtained from lab testing.
gabions were designed to hold 12 inches of compost-amended soil (topsoil was not available) on the face of the walls by wire mesh frames (figure a).
liming materials with high cce, like ca(oh)2 (slaked lime, hydrated lime, or builders lime) and cao (unslaked lime, burned lime, or quicklime), can be caustic to germinating seeds and, if used, should be applied several months before sowing (havlin and others 1999).
for practical purposes, it should be assumed that without supplemental additions of nitrogen (from fertilizers or nitrogen-fixing plants), the immobilization of nitrogen in soils with high c:n will be in the order of months, if not years.
fresh piles of wood fiber have the potential to spontaneously ignite in larger piles, creating a fire hazard and potential loss of material.
when straw is used as a seed mulch, it is important that the application rates are not too deep that a physical barrier is formed.
nutrients other than nitrogen can be supplied by fertilizers shown in table 10.1.
applying fertilizer through a hydroseeding system after seedling establishment is one strategy for increasing available nutrients on the site.
this is not only a waste of fertilizer, but can be source of ground water pollution.
if percent cover of nitrogen fixing host plants is low, then the amount of nitrogen supplied to the site will be correspondingly low (figure 10.40b).
quantity of incorporated organic matter.
collect samples from each of the plant communities that are considered for litter collection and keep these samples separate.
because of this, the release of nutrients from the decomposition of organic fertilizers often coincides with the period when plants are growing (spring and fall) and the need for nutrients is greatest.
seed placement during mulching — seeds can be sown prior to or during mulch operation.
if nutrients are highly mobile, the easiest and least expensive method is to apply fertilizer to the soil surface, or broadcast, to allow rainfall or snowmelt to release and move nutrients into the soil.
a stable compost will have a low respirometry rate ( (after alexander 2003).
particles with greater surface area to volume ratios should decompose faster than particles with less surface area to volume.
the depth that litter and duff accumulates will vary by species composition, age, and productivity of the plant community.
mobile nutrients, such as nitrogen, are leached and unavailable in the spring when the establishing plants require them.
this is not always possible, especially when topsoil storage space is limited.
it is therefore important that mulch be free of large pieces of wood.
it is very important to be sure of the quality of the material.
co-composts, for instance, can have ratios between 9:1 and 11:1, indicating they are a ready source of available soil nitrogen.
if viable seed rates are high in the litter and duff, and it does not contain large material, it can be applied in a variety of ways (e.g., hydroseeder, mulch blowing equipment).
like soil sampling, samples should be collected by obtaining a composite of subsamples of an area.
chipped wood, for instance, has a low surface area to volume ratio and would take longer to break down than long strands of ground wood or fine screened sawdust, which have greater surfaces areas.
these materials come in rolls or sheets, which are laid out on disturbed soils and anchored in place after seeds have been sown.
10.1.7.3 sources and application of ectomycorrhizal fungi three common sources of ecm inoculants are soil, spores, or pure culture vegetative inoculum.
the longevity of organic aggregate mulches is a function of: 1) c:n, 2) texture, and 3) depth.
a. b. figure 10.31 — many plants rely on symbiotic relationships to survive and grow in nature (a).
the objectives for applying mulch on some projects are to spread materials that contain native seeds.
mats with the highest loft create the best microenvironment for seed germination while allowing some sunlight to penetrate to the surface of the soil.
it is possible to make your own inoculum from spores.
claassen and hogan (1998) suggest higher rates, especially on granitic soils, of 1,100 lb/ac total nitrogen.
the barrier must have a spillway (a low point in the structure) and be keyed into the sides to assure that concentrated water does not erode around its sides.
duff and litter — duff and litter layers are organic mats that form under tree and shrub plant communities.
this solution is a homemade liquid inoculant, ready to apply in the same method as cultured inoculant as described below.
post-establishment — once vegetation is established (one or two years after sowing), fertilizers can be applied at higher rates with the assurance that nutrients will be taken up by the plants.
some native grass species grown for seed production are very difficult to harvest and clean.
because of the limited application range, this equipment is limited to sites adjacent to roads.
then, rinse and pulverize them in a blender for several minutes to make a slurry.
the species affected byfrankia are called "actinorhizal" plants (table 10.11).
since nitrogen is the key nutrient in establishing plant communities, this approach requires setting short-term and long-term nitrogen requirements of the plant community being established.
dry topsoils store longer and maintain greater populations of viable mycorrhizal fungi (miller and jastrow 1992).
it consists of a roller with large conical metal "teeth" that is pulled behind a tractor.
as with straw, this product is limited by the accessibility of the site by hay transportation and blowing equipment.
10.1.6.3 select liming materials there are several types of liming materials commercially available (table 10.10) and selection should be based on costs, reactivity, effects on seed germination, and composition of the material.
be clear what "weed free" means when you purchase these materials.
the effectiveness of a mulch in discouraging the establishment of competing vegetation generally increases with the thickness it is placed on the soil surface (baskin and baskin 1989).
in turn, the surface ultimately becomes stable through the establishment of young plants.
wood strands are delivered in different size bales and applied by hand or through straw blowing equipment (figure 10.23).
chipped wood, for instance, has a low surface area to volume ratio and would take longer to break down than long strands of ground wood or fine screened sawdust, which have greater surfaces areas.
likewise, dry or cold conditions tend to result in slower accumulation of nitrogen.
pure culture inoculants of nitrogen-fixing bacteria usually come in small packets of finely ground peat moss (figure 10.41a).
if the objective is to restore a site to its original productivity, the placement of topsoil should be at a depth equal to or greater than the topsoil horizon of undisturbed reference sites.
fungal spores do not have a long shelf-life and should be applied immediately.
the surface had been left rough so that, over time, some of the liming materials would naturally become incorporated into the surface through soil movement.
pine needles provide the greatest benefit because the long needles interlock, reducing the potential of movement from rain or wind erosion (figure 10.18f).
peat-based inoculants are added to chlorine-free water to create a liquid slurry (allowing a bucket of tap water to stand uncovered for 24 hours is a good way to let chlorine evaporate).if a blender is available, using it to blend some inoculant in water is a very good practice to ensure the bacteria will be evenly mixed in the solution.
nitrogen-fixing bacteria host plants nitrogen fixing plants common plant species family subfamily rhizobium spp.
in fumigated nursery soils, inoculated seedlings are much larger and healthier than those that lack the fungal partner (b).
when the "nitrogen-fixing" plant sheds its leaves, dies, or dies back, the nitrogen stored in the plant's tissues is cycled to other plants and through the ecosystem.
a soil with a high cec holds a much greater amount of cations, such as calcium and magnesium, than a soil with low cec.
a fine compost will decompose faster than a coarse, screened compost.
the effectiveness of organic aggregate mulches on seedling survival and growth depends on the depth, total area covered, the control of seed germination of competing vegetation, and its longevity.
the more tines that are placed on a toolbar, the more area of soil can be shattered.
the 3 by 3 ft sheet mulch shown around this pacific madrone ( arbutus menziesii) seedling is the minimum size for this site.
live propagules per pound (typical rates for endomycorrhizal inoculums average around 60,000 to 100,000 propagules per pound and 110,000,000 propagules per pound in ectomycorrhizal inoculums.)
shattering compaction at depths of at least 2 feet is essential for the healthy growth of most perennial plant species.
applying too much straw will restrict sunlight and growing space for establishing seedlings.
figure 10.46 — constructed wetlands capture water from roadside runoff and filter sediments before water enters perennial streams.
small field trials using different species and erosion mats can help in these decisions (figure 10.21).
a host plant such as corn, sorghum, clover, or an herbaceous native plant is then grown in this substrate; as the host grows, the amf multiply in the growing medium (figure 10.36a).
this method is advantageous on steep slopes or soil-faced gabion walls (inset 10.3) where placing seed prior to mat installation is very difficult.
manufactured products and woody debris are "keyed" (partially buried) into the soil surface to prevent water from eroding under the structure.
the period when topsoils are dry is generally limited to the beginning of the summer through the middle of fall, which may not always lend itself to construction schedules.
this can be difficult since there are a variety of wood waste reduction equipment, producing different dimensions and fibrosity (the degree that wood fibers are separated).
each objective discussed insection 10.1.5.2 will yield different application rates.
10.1.3.10 wood strands wood strands are long, thin pieces of wood, produced from wood waste veneer.
most soil shattering equipment is attached to a tractor toolbar and is limited to slope gradients of 3h:1v or less.
if infiltration rates of soils above the terraces are low, runoff will occur, even from low intensity rainfall.
to give some idea of decomposition rates, claassen and carey (2004) found that partially composted yard waste with a c:n of 18:1 took over a year for nitrogen to become available under aerobic incubation testing conditions.
select inoculant should be used if it can be obtained; these contain optimal partners for the species they were matched for, providing a good supply of nitrogen at a low cost to the plant.
the shoots of host plants are removed and the substrate, now rich in roots, spores, and mycelium, is chopped up (figure 10.36b).
islands can be created by excavating an appropriate area to a depth of several feet and backfilling with either topsoil or compost-amended material (figure 10.48).
since mulch is delivered through hoses, the system will plug if the size of the wood fibers exceeds the tube size.
nitrogen supplied from fertilizers or nitrogen-fixing plants will speed up decomposition rates.
under most disturbed soil conditions, the best that can be expected this equipment is tillage to a depth of 8 to 12 inches.
as the excavator pulls topsoil into place and contours the slope, it presses the face of the bucket into the soil surface to form surface imprints.
it is important to compare the ph of post-construction soils with reference site soils to determine if the ph is substantially different between the two.
the nutrient release mechanism of slow-release organic fertilizers reduces the risk that highly mobile nutrients, such as nitrogen, will be released in the winter months when plants are incapable of absorbing them and the potential for leaching is greatest.
figure 10.26 — soil textures that are suitable as "loam borrow" are shown in light brown on the usda textural triangle.
if weeds are observed during the field survey, it should be assumed that the seeds of these species are present in the topsoil and these areas should be avoided.
nitrates from fast-release fertilizers have been found to leach through sandy soils to depths that are 4 times the rate of rainfall (dancer 1975).
revegetation specialists should keep an eye on developments in this field and see how their plants can benefit from new insights into the roles of microorganisms.
the higher the c:n, the greater the likelihood that nitrogen will be unavailable for plant uptake.
the practice of protecting and re-establishing beneficial microorganisms is a key one for revegetation.
10.1.7.6 nitrogen-fixing bacteria nitrogen-fixing bacteria live in nodules on plant roots and accumulate ("fix") nitrogen from the air and share it with their host plants.
for revegetation work associated with road construction and road obliteration, tillage to break up deep compaction is important for reestablishing plant communities.
mulch can also be moved to the site in tractor buckets and spread across the soil surface with the blade or bucket of the tractor.
native straw is generally longer and stronger than grain straw (norland 2000).
if available, choose seedlings that were inoculated with select bacteria.
unprocessed organic fertilizers are hard to apply to roadside projects because they are bulky and high in moisture.
minimizing topsoil disturbance is preferred to topsoiling, especially on sensitive soils, such as those derived from granitic and serpentine bedrock (claassen and others 1995).
the equipment applies a downward compressive force to a metal mold, leaving an impression on the soil surface.
plant communities dominated by conifers, for instance, function well between ph 5.0 to 6.5, whereas grass-dominated plant communities in arid climates perform well between ph 6.5 and 8.0.
this is particularly true for compacted soils and those that have been removed and stockpiled.
excessive moisture can turn the piles into compost and possibly affect seed viability.
for example, the "dixon" imprinter was developed to restore perennial grasses for rangelands in arizona and other arid states.
for example, a sandy loam soil has an existing ph of 5.0 (a) and a target ph after liming of ph 6.0 (b).
in this example 1,900 lb/ac of limestone was needed to achieve the target ph (2,800 less 900).
this can be done using any type of seeding method (e.g., hydroseed, drill, or hand broadcast).
large pores created by long-fibered mulches also allow better gas exchange between the soil and atmosphere (borland 1990).
mixing topsoil and subsoil together will dilute microbial biomass and mycorrhizal inoculum of the topsoil, which will decrease their effectiveness in reestablishing nutrient cycling.
the gabion walls were built in the summer of 2003, but the seeds did not germinate until late fall after several rainstorms.
the fungal hyphae increase the area of absorption for water and mineral nutrients, whereas fungal mantle covers the root and protects it from desiccation and pathogens (a).
if this is not possible, have them send you samples of different mulch products.
the site was on a very steep slope where incorporating the limestone was not feasible (see section 10.1.6.5).
this will assure that when the mat is pinned to the soil, it is in intimate contact with the soil surface.
the winged subsoiler and rock ripper should be adjusted to meet the soil conditions of the site.
for verification, it is recommended that plant samples be sent to a laboratory where they can also provide a numerical rating of inoculation effectiveness.
threshold levels represent the minimum level of nutrients needed for a site.
fungal spores do not have a long shelf-life and should be applied immediately.
= 331 lbs/ac calculated amount of total nitrogen in soil layer to convert to kg/ha: e * 1.12 f minimum or threshold n levels 1,100 lbs/ac determined from reference sites (see figure 10.1)
for instance, a lime material passing a 100-mesh screen reacts faster and takes less quantity than material passing a 50-mesh screen.
compost results from the controlled biological decomposition of organic material.
tablets or packets can be placed in the planting hole (figure 10.34b).
live propagules per acre (typical rates range from 1,000,000 to 3,600,00 live propagules per acre).
spores will not easily pass through irrigation injectors or nozzles, and do not move downward or through the soil into the soil with water.
dry topsoil should also store longer and maintain better viability than moist topsoil (visser, fujikawa, and others 1984).
particles with greater surface area to volume ratios should decompose faster than particles with less surface area to volume.
the rate of limestone for the surface soil was subtracted from the target rate to give the quantity of limestone to add to 7 inches of soil (the depth of incorporation upon which these graphs were based).
screens only sort for two dimensions, and not for length or fibrousness.
the seeds held tightly to the fabric during transportation and handling.
the particle size and shape of the organic source can also be important in slope hydrology by increasing infiltration and permeability rates.
to determine how nitrogen-fixing plants should be used in revegetation project, assess which nitrogen-fixing host species are native to the area and consider the nitrogen fixation rates that can be expected.
to verify the effectiveness of amf inoculation, roots must be stained and examined under a microscope (figure 10.37d).
without their microsymbiont partners, plants become stunted and often die.
the bacteria must come in contact with the root systems early in the plant's life, ideally within the first 2 to 6 weeks of growth.
without their microsymbiont partners, plants become stunted and often die.
larger stemmed grasses, such as blue wildrye (elymus glaucus), mountain brome (bromus marginatus), and bluebunch wheatgrass (pseudoroegneria spicata) make good mulches because of the large leaves and stems.
if tines are set below this depth, the tines will not shatter the soil (figure 10.9b).
typically, the coarser the size of the mulch, the cheaper will be production costs since more mulch of coarser size can be produced in a given time frame than smaller textured mulch.
if possible, collect nodules from several plants.
during the early stages of composting, heat is generated at temperatures that are lethal to weed seeds, insects, and pathogens (inset 10.6).
in this example, the threshold was established at 1,100 lb/ac, which was between the total n of a disturbed reference site with "poor" revegetation (a) and one with "fair" revegetation (b).
a great advantage to using hydroseeding equipment is that it can uniformly spread fertilizers on steep slopes and a variety of topographies.
some species grown for native seed production are difficult to harvest and clean because of long awns (figure 10.22).
soil shattering involves pulling one tooth, or a set of teeth, at various depths through the soil to break up compaction created by equipment traffic.
fertilizing dormant plants is also a possible way to minimize damage.
once plant materials are obtained from the wild or from nurseries, they are installed on the project site.
coarser textured products (figure 10.37a) are meant for incorporation into soil or growing media, and finer-textured products (figure 10.37b) are applied as wettable powders through sprayers or injected into irrigation systems.
the second design churns and mixes the soil.
therefore, less quantity of finer grade materials will be required for immediate ph soil change.
compared to short-fibered mulches, such hydromulch, long-fibered mulches can be applied at greater thicknesses, which help maintain surface soil moisture and higher humidity around germinating seeds and emerging seedlings.
on the other hand, wheat straw (c:n = 80:1) or pine needles (c:n = 110:1) can be effective for several years.
the capacity of a soil to hold positive ions (referred to as bases or cations) is called the cation exchange capacity (cec).
figure d shows a close up section of wall with newly germinating seedlings coming through the erosion mat in late 2003, four months after wall construction.
it is important, therefore, to incorporate liming materials into the soil at the depth where the ph change is desired.
pure culture inoculum — mycorrhizal fungi are available commercially as pure cultures, usually in a peat-based carrier (figure 10.34).
compost results from the controlled biological decomposition of organic material.
some types of beneficial microorganisms are called "microsymbionts" because they form a symbiotic (mutually beneficial) relationship with plants.
this solution is then watered into the root system of each seedling using a watering can.
when plants lack mycorrhizae, they become stunted and sometimes chlorotic ("yellow") in appearance.
growth rates accelerate again in the fall.
for nursery-grown materials, nitrogen-fixing bacteria must be introduced in the nursery.
during topsoil excavation, the litter and duff layers are usually removed with the topsoil.
straw and hay are often used on revegetation projects because they are available, comparatively inexpensive, and generally successful in establishing grass and forb plants from seeds.
the strategy might concentrate topsoil in areas such as planting islands, planting pockets, or in a mosaic pattern that blends with the natural vegetative community.
in this practice, there is no return to the site in later years to assess whether additional applications of fertilizers might be essential for vegetation maintenance or growth.
the availability of many nutrients is regulated by soil ph.
optimum environments for decomposition include high moisture, warm temperatures, and available nutrients, all conditions present in most topsoil piles.
this equates to 1.5 to 2 tons per acre, depending on the type of straw and its moisture content.
however, where large rocks or large slash are present, closely spaced tines will drag these materials out of the ground.
the non-topsoiled areas could be treated with other mitigating measures, such as organic matter incorporation or mulching.
a. when seeding occurs in the fall, seeds typically do not germinate until the following spring, at which time there is rapid growth.
the imprinter creates a pattern of v-shaped troughs, 4 to 7 inches deep, encompassing approximately 1 ft2 area (dixon and carr 2001a, 2001b).
erosion mats are manufactured blankets or mats designed to increase surface stability and control erosion.
this is a far greater quantity than if the objective was to increase nutrient supply, which would require 2 inches of compost added to the top 12 inches of soil.
these layers are accumulations of years of leaves and needles at varying degrees of decomposition.
in fumigated nursery soils, inoculated seedlings are much larger and healthier than those that lack the fungal partner (b).
nursery pot culture — this option is only viable in a nursery when plants are being grown for a specific restoration project, and is unique to amf fungi because of their wide host range.
the hydromulch (dyed with a green tracer) shown in this picture is applied at approximately 1,500 lb/ac.
large trucks can hold between 75 and 100 yards of mulch (a) while smaller trucks can hold up to 25 yards (c).
they are available in strips or rolls with a minimum thickness of 0.75 inch.
a rule of thumb is that some surface soil (15% to 20%) should be visible through the straw after application (kay 1972, 1983; jackson and others 1988).
revegetation projects can be enhanced by integrating plants into bioengineering structures, water capture features, or planting islands or pockets.
tests of inoculation effectiveness have shown significant differences between products (c).
10.1.3.8 erosion mats figure 10.21 — small field trials can help select the most appropriate species and materials for a project.
the undisturbed topsoil of reference sites showed a total n of 2,430 lb/ac (d), which sets the target levels of nitrogen between 1,100 and 2,430 lb/ac.
fertilizer selection should focus first on the macronutrients (nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus) that are deficient.
while we do not have that capability in wildland settings, we can use the fertilizers available to us more wisely by applying our understanding of how the assortment of fertilizers function in meeting the nutrient requirements of plant communities.
fertilizers applied as slow-release form are preferred because they have less potential for causing salt damage when applied over emerging seedlings.
a good source of straw is native seed production fields.
for example, organic matter will decompose faster in the coast range of oregon than in the mountains of idaho.
to confirm inoculation, plant roots must be stained so that the fungal hyphae are visible under a microscope (d).
however, the quality of commercial sources can be variable so it is important to verify the quality of the inoculum.
obtaining an even mulch depth is extremely difficult using this method, and requires many passes of the equipment that invariably compacts the soil.
the approach we advocate is applying the appropriate mix of fertilizers to meet the annual needs of the vegetation while building long-term nutrient capital until the plant community is self-sustaining.
in the same manner, fertilizers applied to the soil surface, especially those containing immobile nutrients, will be mixed into the top several inches of soil and made available to surface roots.
burnt lime (cao) for instance, might have a cce of 150, which means that it has a 50% greater neutralizing capacity than pure limestone and much less of this material needs to be applied to increase ph.
superior strains can yield significant differences in productivity and growth rate of the host plant; in some cases over 40% better growth (schmit, 2003).
coarser-textured products (a) can be incorporated into soil or growing media, whereas finer-textured products can be sprayed like a wettable powder (b).
the results from these trials indicated that we could attach native grass and forb seeds to erosion mats using a tackifier (b).
these structures will require the input of the design engineer and cooperation of the project engineer, and must be built during the construction phase of the project.
until they become naturally inoculated, plants are dependent on nitrogen fertilizers and may become out-competed by weeds.
when fast-release fertilizers (dashed line) are applied in the fall during seeding, fertilizers move into the soil with fall rains.
while these materials are typically more effective when incorporated into the soil, they are sometimes applied to the surface of the soil where tillage is not feasible (steep and rocky) or tillage costs are unaffordable.
organic fertilizers include animal manures (including chicken, steer, cow), bone meal, fish emulsion, composted sewage sludge, and yard waste.
fine limestone materials can be difficult to apply in dry form through fertilizer spreaders.
calcium and magnesium are less available at low ph; phosphorus, iron, manganese, boron, zinc and copper become unavailable in high ph soils.
seedling mulches are applied either as an organic aggregate or as sheets.
wood chips applied at the same rates are less likely to form continuous routes for water drainage because of their shape.
since mulch is delivered through hoses, the system will plug if the size of the wood fibers exceeds the tube size.
this is a highly effective technique for propagating amf in the nursery and could also be used on the planting site.
it is not easy to predict how long nitrogen will be immobilized in a soil.
soil inoculum can also be collected under the same plant species adjacent to the project site (figure 10.33a).
in general, about 100 grams of cultured inoculant is usually sufficient to inoculate up to 3,000 seedlings in nursery conditions.
duff is the dark, decomposed layer directly below the litter layer (leaves and needles are not identifiable in the duff layer) that is high in nutrients and humus.
each liming material is rated by how well it neutralizes the soil.
however, most road projects involve severe disturbances and so healthy populations of beneficial microorganisms may be depleted or even absent.
the long stems of these materials create loft, or high porosity, that keeps moisture near the soil surface where seeds are germinating.
however, when wind is blowing against the direction mulch is being applied, the distance is reduced.
alternatively, compost and other soil amendments (including lime and fertilizers) can be spread over planting islands at the depth needed to amend the soil profile and mixed thoroughly through the islands with an excavator or backhoe.
contour bench terraces are designed to collect enough water to recharge soils and provide sufficient water for plant growth during the summer, but also be protected from erosion during peak rainstorm events.
however, straw is the stubble left over after seeds have been harvested from commercial seed or grain crops; hay comes from grass/legume fields usually grown for feed.
seeds have greater opportunities to germinate and become established in the micro-valleys because of increased moisture, higher humidity, protection from the wind, and shelter from the sun.
on the other hand, wheat straw (c:n = 80:1) or pine needles (c:n = 110:1) can be effective for several years.
the tests are based on the test method for the examination of composting and composts (tmecc) protocols.
frequently, these failures are attributed to poor nursery stock or fertilization, when the real problem was the absence of the proper microorganism.
sufficient topsoil quantities however, are rarely available in the quantities needed to restore disturbed sites to their original topsoil depths.
this is especially useful for applying small quantities of fertilizer, such as micronutrients, which are difficult to spread evenly over large areas.
for sites where topsoil is not available or in short supply, organic matter can be applied to improve post-construction soils.
on the other hand, the spores of amf species are large and released underground and so cannot reinoculate plants very quickly.
finer lime materials are more expensive to purchase.
compaction will affect surface infiltration and runoff, therefore, trackwalking should be critically evaluated for its potential increase in soil erosion.
if bales are stored in dry conditions, seeds can remain viable for several years.
how fertilizers actually release in the field will vary by the environment.
if possible, work with a specialist to help with the following: in addition to learning how to effectively apply mycorrhizal fungi, some soil management modifications will be required to promote formation of mycorrhizal partnerships in the field.
the threshold was set between these two nitrogen levels.
the advantages of wood strands over straw are that it is free of seeds, has a longer life, and is more resistant to wind.
other factors, such as tree species, moisture content, and portion of tree processed, will affect the characteristics of the mulch.
as discussed in section 5.8.1.2, mulch materials with high c:n discourage growth of weedy annuals because high c:n materials remove available nitrogen that would otherwise give these species a competitive advantage.
viability of stored topsoil is a function of moisture, temperature, oxygen, nitrogen, and time.
coarse-textured materials also tend to hold less moisture, which slows decomposition rates.
the release of nutrients is therefore a function of moisture and temperature, which governs the rate of bacterial growth.
when the ph of the subsoil is significantly lower than the topsoil, liming to raise soil ph to reference topsoil levels (target levels) should be considered.
this will assure that the material does not move downslope.
figure 10.28 gives an example of how to calculate the amount of organic matter to incorporate to meet minimum levels of nitrogen.
f. slow- and fast-release fertilizers can be applied in the early spring before rapid root and vegetative growth.
however, if equipment is not available for mixing on steep sites, applying very fine liming materials through hydroseeding equipment is a possible way of raising ph.
however, if liming will actually be done on a revegetation project, the smp buffer method should be used for calculations.
after emergence, some plants become naturally inoculated by airborne spores and grow much larger and healthier than those that lack the fungal symbiont (figure 10.32b).
appropriate beneficial microorganism can be reintroduced by "inoculating" seeds as they are sown in the field or in the nursery, or by introducing the microorganism in the planting hole.
the effectiveness of rippers can be increased by multiple passes through the soil or by adding tines to the toolbar.
in addition to mixing organic amendments into the soil, the subsoiler grapple rake can remove large rock with the grapples and loosen soils with the winged subsoiling tines.
for immobile nutrients, broadcast fertilizer application can be relatively ineffective.
frequently, these failures are attributed to poor nursery stock or fertilization, when the real problem was the absence of the proper microorganism.
therefore, use of nitrogen-fixing plants can be an important part of accelerating rehabilitation of degraded land.
compost — the organic component of manufactured topsoil (see section 10.1.5) is composted materials from of a variety of materials including yard waste materials (grass clippings, leaves, and ground wood of trees and shrubs), sawdust, and biosolids.
for example, the incorporation of alfalfa hay (c:n =13:1) will decompose quickly, and the effects on soil structure might be short-lived.
pulling a single tine (a) above a critical depth does some soil shattering as compared to a single tine ripping deeper than a critical depth (b).
it is only through the partnership with bacteria that these plants are able to obtain atmospheric nitrogen.
figure 10.4 — germination of seeds for some species can be reduced following exposure to a 10-30-10 fertilizer solution at a rate of 750 lbs fertilizer per 1,000 gallon hydroseeder (after carr and ballard 1979).
the results from these trials indicated that we could attach native grass and forb seeds to erosion mats using a tackifier (b).
the depth of topsoil application is generally based on the amount of topsoil available and the desired productivity of the site after application.
nevertheless, spreading mulch on the soil surface prior to ripping or subsoiling usually incorporates enough organic matter into the soil surface to enhance infiltration rates (luce 1997).
the amount of limestone to apply (e) is 1,900 lb/ac, which is calculated by subtracting 900 (c) from 2,800 (d).
topographic enhancement integrates three components into the roadside design — soil improvement, site stability, and water harvesting (figure 10.43).
the nitrogen-fixing potential of 15-year-old stands of ceanothus velutinus and purshia tridentata was directly proportional to plant cover (b) (adapted after busse 2000).
during the early stages of composting, heat is generated at temperatures that are lethal to weed seeds, insects, and pathogens (inset 10.6).
the rating system is called calcium carbonate equivalent (cce).
release rate determinations are performed in the laboratory.
in fact, the target nitrogen levels in this example for establishing and maintaining the original plant community would be closer to the undisturbed reference site.
the strategy might concentrate topsoil in areas such as planting islands, planting pockets, or in a mosaic pattern that blends with the natural vegetative community.
not only do microorganisms compete with plants for nitrogen, they store it in their cell walls, making it unavailable for plant growth for long periods of time.
if topsoil and organic matter are not available on the project site, spores or commercial inoculants can be used instead.
the period of time that nitrogen remains immobilized in the soil is dependent on several factors: climate.
the role of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and their partner plants is crucial to roadside restoration.
since dolomite, which has a higher cce value, would be applied, there would be less of this material needed (581 lb/ac).
conserving existing topsoil and organic matter is a key practice to protect existing populations of beneficial microorganisms.
the insulative quality of mulches also affects the seasonal heating and cooling patterns in the soil.
attaching wings to the tines is very effective in shattering compaction between the tines (e) (modified after andrus and froehlich 1983).
the "pine straw" industry, as it is referred to, has been established to harvest needles in a sustainable manner from young plantations of southern pine species to meet this demand.
on the contrary, a different inoculant strain for each nitrogen-fixing species is usually necessary.
as discussed insection 10.1.1, fertilizers, the delayed timing of fertilization reduces the risk of nutrient leaching and increases the probability that nutrients will be available at the levels needed for established plants.
figure 10.9 — the effectiveness of subsoiling or ripping equipment to shatter compacted soil is a function of tine depth, number of tines, distance between tines, and wing configuration.
the basic components of a manufactured topsoil are the loam borrow, compost, and soil amendments (e.g., fertilizer or lime amendment).
one liter of liquefied inoculant made from either nodules or cultured inoculant as per the instructions above is diluted in more chlorine-free water.
release rates are important because they will determine the rates at which nutrients become available to plants during the year.
mulches produced from woody materials are used primarily for seed covering and seedling mulching.
fertilizers applied at this time will be taken up by growing vegetation.
actual field trials could be installed prior to construction to measure the effects of soil amendments on infiltration.
a half point ph difference in this case can result in an increase of over 1,000 lb/ac in application rates.
it is important that these tests be run by sta laboratories.
in natural ecosystems, the root systems of successful plants have several microbial partnerships that allow them to survive and grow even in harsh conditions (figure 10.31).
larger stemmed grasses, such as blue wildrye (elymus glaucus), mountain brome (bromus marginatus), and bluebunch wheatgrass (pseudoroegneria spicata) make good mulches because of the large leaves and stems.
this will assure that when the mat is pinned to the soil, it is in intimate contact with the soil surface.
in a review of tillage projects on rangeland soils, gifford (1975) found that deep tillage greatly reduced runoff, while shallow tillage had little effect.
selecting the appropriate organic matter, soil texture, and soil amendments for manufactured topsoil will increase the success of the project.
the higher the c:n, the greater the likelihood that nitrogen will be unavailable for plant uptake.
climates with lower moisture and temperatures can be more favorable to long-term storage.
table 10.1 and table 10.2 show the combination of nutrients that are available in some commercially available fertilizers.
application rates and methods for ectomycorrhizal inoculums will vary by species.
inset 10.3 — case study: erosion mats with native grasses and forbs reconstruction of the agness-illahe highway required the construction of long sections of gabion walls.
each plant community has an optimal ph range.
inoculation effectiveness has been shown to vary considerably between different products (figure 10.37c), so it is wise to install tests before purchasing large quantities of a specific product.
when the nitrogen-fixing plant sheds leaves or dies, the nitrogen stored in the plant's tissues is cycled to adjacent plants.
a and b), whereas mulch produced from chippers has close to equal length sides, with fibers still intact (figure 10.18 c).
for example, ponderosa pine (pinus ponderosa) and western juniper (juniperus occidentalis ) tend to create more fibrous mulch than lodgepole pine (pinus contorta ).
overall costs are much higher because of the added expenses of transporting these materials to the site.
the advantages of wood strands over straw are that it is free of seeds, has a longer life, and is more resistant to wind.
a. b. c. d. figure 10.37 — several commercial amf inoculums are available and consist of fungal spores mixed with an inert carrier to aid in application.
several studies have indicated that it can take more than a decade for surface-applied lime (not incorporated) to raise soil ph to a depth of 6 inches (havlin and others 1999).

wood waste, stumps, land clearing debris semi-coarse table 10.5 — table of general types of wood waste reduction equipment (modified from re-sourcing associates and cpm consultants 1997).
research on a northern california road construction site (claassen and zasoski 1994) suggests that a depth of 4 to 8 inches was required for an effective use of topsoil.
knowing which species you are working with is essential in order to match the plants with their appropriate microsymbiont partners.
in fact, the typical fertilizer practice does just the opposite — high rates of fertilizers are put on with seeds before there are even plants to utilize the available nutrients.
specifying the particle size and shape by stating a screen size the material must pass does not always produce the desired material.
these guides describe how to take the species lists developed in chapter 6 and obtain the desired species in the wild as seed, cuttings, or seedlings.
the two most important microsymbionts for revegetation projects are mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria.
third, as with all slopes being revegetated, concentrated water should be kept off these slopes.
however, when wind is blowing against the direction mulch is being applied, the distance is reduced.
figure 10.22 — seeds of some species are baled with straw because of the difficulty of seed harvesting and cleaning.
most equipment is limited to moderate slope gradients (less than 1v:2h).
one method for determining the amount of viable seeds in a litter layer is to actually conduct a germination test at the project site over a several year period by obtaining litter and duff from several potential collection areas and testing them on nearby sites.
this is done by dividing values that come as gr/l, ppm, mg/kg, and ug/g by 10,000 to convert to a percentage.
an application hose is positioned where mulch is to be applied and is pneumatically delivered from the mulch bins to the site.
an alternative method of seed harvest for these species is to allow the seeds to ripen in the fields and bale the seeds and grass stems together.
most fresh and aged organic sources have c:n greater than 15:1 (table 10.8) and will immobilize nitrogen for some period of time when incorporated into the soil.
when used to break up compaction, one or two large ripper tines are typically pulled behind a large bulldozer at 1 to 3 ft soil depths.
the squirreltail seeds are germinating from the heads of the seeds that came in the bales (b).
two species of nitrogen-fixing bacteria that are important in revegetation arerhizobium and frankia.
when wind is favorable, straw can be shot up to 100 ft.
inorganic slow-release fertilizers include ureaform, nitroform, ibdu (isobutylidene diurea), sulfur-coated urea, and polymer-coated nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
fill slope microcatchments are structures that capture runoff from outsloped road surfaces and compacted shoulders into terraces and berms where it can be used for plant growth (figure 10.45).
the symbiotic partnership between plants and their nitrogen-fixing microsymbionts works this way:
in this symbiotic partnership the bacteria give nitrogen accumulated from the atmosphere to the plant, and in exchange the bacteria get a site to grow and energy in the form of carbohydrates from the plant.
however, there is no guarantee that the plants will still be colonized when they are planted at the project site.
the tests are based on the test method for the examination of composting and composts (tmecc) protocols.
approximation method — for a quick approximation of lime application rates, the calculations shown in figure 10.29 and figure 10.30 are used.
inter-island areas are planted to shrubs and grasses.
the thicker erosion mats with the most loft should have better conditions for seedling establishment than thinner materials.
the seeds are detached from the stem as it is blown through the equipment, falling to the surface of the soil and covered by the grass stems.
calculating the amount of phosphorous and potassium in the bag is a little trickier because the convention for reporting these nutrients is p2o5 and k2o instead of elemental p and k. to convert p2o5 to p, the analysis for p is divided by 2.29.
therefore, applying amf inoculum as a topdressing is not a good option.
other ectomycorrhizal fungal inoculums are applied at the time of planting and here the objective is to get the inoculum in contact with the plant roots.
on nitrogen-poor sites, sowing or planting a higher proportion of these species can help a site to recover nitrogen fertility and organic matter (figure 10.40a).
the "pine straw" industry, as it is referred to, has been established to harvest needles in a sustainable manner from young plantations of southern pine species to meet this demand.
rock fragments have little to no cec because they are massive and typically unweathered.
since these mycorrhizal fungi are very specific to their host species, it is important to work closely with company representatives when using ectomycorrhizal inoculum.
an excessive amount of phosphorus in the fertilizer inhibits formation of the partnership; therefore phosphorus should be reduced.
release rates are available from the manufacturers for most inorganic, slow-release fertilizers.
the first year results indicated that there was much better establishment of grasses on the polywoven erosion mat than the straw mat, yet no difference in species growth.
a specific amf is acquired either commercially or from a field site as a starter culture, and then added to a sterile potting medium.
birch alder, birch oleaster silverberry, buffaloberry myrtle myrtle buckthorn cascara, snowbrush, deerbrush rose mountain mahogany, cliffrose, bitterbrush table 10.11 — nitrogen-fixing bacteria and their plant hosts.
the seeded bales are applied directly to the site through straw blowing equipment, accomplishing seeding and mulching in one operation (figures 10.22 and 10.23).
the removal of topsoil should only be done in areas that will be excavated, severely compacted, or buried with excavated material, such as fill slopes.
with greater burning restrictions and higher hauling costs, chipping these materials and returning them to disturbed sites as mulch are practices that are becoming more common.
mulch is pneumatically delivered to the site through an application hose which can reach several hundred feet up steep slopes (a) with still enough force for ample delivery of mulch (b).
while there would be less weight with this more concentrated fertilizer, this is considered a dangerous rate of fertilizer to apply.
application — straw and hay can be spread by hand or with a straw blower.
they are darker in appearance than fresh sources, but the appearance of the original organic source can still be discerned (e.g., needles or leaves are still identifiable).
forfrankia, desirable nodules will be white or yellow inside.
an alternative method of seed harvest for these species is to allow the seeds to ripen in the fields and bale the seeds and grass stems together.
figure 10.23 — straw blowers range in size from machines which can apply 30 to 60 bales per hour (shown here) to very large straw blowers that can shoot up to 20 tons per hour.
this process, part of the nitrogen cycle, is the major source of nitrogen fertility in most natural ecosystems.
the islands are planted with conifers and 3 inches of mulch are applied to entire islands to keep them free of competing vegetation.
if shredded or chipped road right-of-way material is to be incorporated into the soil, it should be allowed to age as long as possible in piles.
if a topsoil pile is to be held over winter in areas of moderate to high rainfall, it should be kept dry by covering with plastic (which will also keep the piles protected from erosion and weed establishment).
several small plots using different erosion mats, seed mixes, seed rates and seed-attaching methods were tested to determine how to best meet the revegetation objectives (figure 10.21).
it was therefore decided to place the lime on the surface of the soil through hydroseeding operations.
fertilizer banders were developed for agricultural use and are limited by rock content and slope gradients.
processed root wads tend to be more fibrous than boles of trees.
pine needles provide the greatest benefit because the long needles interlock, reducing the potential of movement from rain or wind erosion (figure 10.18f).
minimizing topsoil disturbance is preferred to topsoiling, especially on sensitive soils, such as those derived from granitic and serpentine bedrock (claassen and others 1995).
the two most important microsymbionts for revegetation projects are mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria.
figure 10.11 — trackwalking creates imprints on the soil surface, but will also compact surface and subsurface soils.
if the shattering pattern is inadequate, adjustments can be made to the tine depth, tine spacing, and angle of the wing.
for example, litter and duff collected from cool, moist sites should not be applied on hot, dry sites.
verifying the effectiveness of amf inoculation — unlike ecm, amf are not visible to the unaided eye.

applying fertilizer through a hydroseeding system after seedling establishment is one strategy for increasing available nutrients on the site.
a. b. figure 10.38 — nitrogen-fixing plants, such as legumes, have symbiotic bacteria on their roots (a) which can chemically "fix" atmospheric nitrogen into forms that can be used by plants as fertilizer (b).
with some fungi, the mantle completely covers fragile root tips (figure 10.32a) and acts as a physical barrier from drying, other pests, and toxic soil contaminants.
for successful germination, seeded erosion mats must be installed so that the seeds and fabric are in direct contact with the soil.
if they are not deficient, chances are that the remaining nutrients are not either.
roughening is also accomplished by either scarifying or imprinting operations.
when considering purchasing compost or any other type of organic matter from a manufacturer, it is important to request the latest lab analysis.
inoculum can also be made from the spores of mushrooms (b), puffballs, or truffles (c) collected from around the proper host plant.
determining minimum topsoil application depths can be based on the minimum amount of nitrogen required to establish a self-maintaining plant community.
the pine straw industry is well developed in this part of the country.
claassen and hogan (1998) suggest higher rates, especially on granitic soils, of 1,100 lb/ac total nitrogen.
this helps ensure successful nodulation and maximizes the benefits of using inoculants.
applying fertilizer at the time of sowing, for instance, will require very low rates of available nitrogen the first year since vegetation will not be established well enough to utilize it.
if the wood is wet during processing, it is more likely to be shredded; if it is dry, it will be more chip-like.
for seedlings, mulch application ranges from 400 yd3/ac (3 inch-thickness) to 540 yd3/ac (4-inch thickness).
for seedlings, mulch application ranges from 400 yd3/ac (3 inch-thickness) to 540 yd3/ac (4-inch thickness).
on sites where freeze-thaw is prevalent, long-fibered mulches can insulate the soil and protect emerging seedlings.
using a mulch blower is an excellent method for evenly applying wood fiber, but frequent monitoring by inspectors is important to assure that the specified amount of mulch is being applied.
they are based on laboratory test results of the compost and threshold nitrogen levels obtained from reference sites.
when hay is harvested, it usually contains seeds from a variety of pasture species.
these areas can be planted with riparian species, such as willows (salix spp).and cottonwoods (populus spp.), or wetland species, such as rushes ( juncus spp).and sedges (carex spp.).
runoff strips are placed in draws or concave topography and are composed of engineered impoundment barriers, using riprap, logs, or gabion baskets, that store water from runoff events.
it is only through the partnership with bacteria that these plants are able to obtain atmospheric nitrogen.
the advantages of using slow-release fertilizers are: 1) nutrients are supplied at a time when plants are potentially growing; 2) less frequent applications; 3) less potential for leaching into ground water; and 4) less potential to cause salt injury.
each fertilizer has its own formulated nutrient release rate, which varies from 3 months to 18 months.
figure 10.22 — seeds of some species are baled with straw because of the difficulty of seed harvesting and cleaning.
first the road contractor piles the woody right-of-way clearing debris into "slash piles."
subsoiling when soils are extremely dry can bring up large blocks of soils, especially when the soils are high in clays (cohesive soils).
smp buffer method — for much greater accuracy, lab testing facilities offer the smp buffer method for determining the lime requirement for a disturbed soil.
verifying the effectiveness of ecm inoculation — luckily, it is fairly easy to recognize ecm as the fungi can be seen with the naked eye on the root system.
since the installed costs of erosion mats can be very expensive, it is important that the job is done right.
table 10.10 — liming materials are rated by how well they neutralize the soil using pure limestone as the baseline of 100%.
organic aggregate mulches have several advantages over sheet mulches.
the process outlined in figure 10.5 can be used for other deficient nutrients.
topsoiling has been found to increase plant cover and biomass through an increase in nutrient availability, water-holding capacity, and microbial activity, including mycorrhizae (claassen and zasoski 1994).
small seeds can be applied over erosion mats if tackifiers are not used and if the timing is correct so sufficient rain will move it through the erosion mat to the soil surface.
it has also been found to increase the number of plant species native to the area.
nevertheless, with surface-applied limestone, it should be assumed that soil ph will not change much deeper than 3 inches below the soil surface.
burnt lime (cao) for instance, might have a cce of 150, which means that it has a 50% greater neutralizing capacity than pure limestone and much less of this material needs to be applied to increase ph.
soil microorganisms need available nitrogen to utilize the carbon source.
the period when topsoils are dry is generally limited to the beginning of the summer through the middle of fall, which may not always lend itself to construction schedules.
areas adjacent to, or that feed into, live water are often delineated and treated with lower rates of fertilizer.
in this symbiotic partnership the bacteria give nitrogen accumulated from the atmosphere to the plant, and in exchange the bacteria get a site to grow and energy in the form of carbohydrates from the plant.
this minimum standard would make most soils below ph 5.5 good candidates for liming.
fast-release fertilizers can supplement slow-release fertilizers by supplying immediately available nutrients.
the inoculum will contain __________
viability of stored topsoil is a function of moisture, temperature, oxygen, nitrogen, and time.
the remaining areas are mulched at a lower rate.

composts are very suitable materials for increasing the water-holding capacity of sandy soils, increasing nutrient supply, and enhancing soil infiltration and permeability rates.
figure 10.28 gives an example of how to calculate the amount of organic matter to incorporate to meet minimum levels of nitrogen.
nitrogen-fixing bacteria live in nodules on plant roots and accumulate ("fix") nitrogen from the air and share it with their host plants.
the chart is based on measuring ph changes of four soil textural classes as limestone is incorporated into the surface 7 inches of soil (chart modified from havlin and others 1999).
this method offers a practical alternative to species such as bottlebrush squirreltail (elymus elymoides ) or western needlegrass (achnatherum occidentale) which can be difficult to harvest and clean.
compost must be free of weed seeds and vegetative material that propagate weedy plants (e.g., blackberry canes).
nursery inoculation can reduce costs in establishment and maintenance; a few dollars worth of inoculant applied in the nursery can replace a lot of purchased nitrogen fertilizer over the life of the nitrogen-fixing plant.
collection of needles and duff should be done during the summer and fall, when the litter and duff are completely dry.
the size of the pile can also affect the viability of the topsoil.
when hay is harvested, it usually contains seeds from a variety of pasture species.
second, the materials must be trenched or keyed into the soil at the upper reaches of the fabric.
reintroducing beneficial microorganisms is therefore a key part of roadside revegetation.
search for nodules with the proper color and pick them off cleanly.
rhizobium grow with some members of the legume family (figure 10.39 a&b), and plants of the elm family.
it is important to define the desired mulch characteristics prior to processing the piles.
long, shredded wood fiber, for example, can create long passageways for water.
slow-release fertilizers — these fertilizers are designed to release nutrients at a much slower rate.
table 10.2 lists common nitrogen fertilizers with typical label analysis.
while the performance of this new product as a seed cover has not been tested, it has all the characteristics of being an excellent seed cover.
this discussion is by no means exhaustive, but intended to introduce the reader to a variety of structures that can be installed during road construction to enhance the establishment of native plants.
these materials are typically applied thinly (figure 10.14), so they offer less insulation than long-fibered mulches and therefore have less value as a seed covering.
a. b. figure 10.38 — nitrogen-fixing plants, such as legumes, have symbiotic bacteria on their roots (a) which can chemically "fix" atmospheric nitrogen into forms that can be used by plants as fertilizer (b).
it is less important to mulch around seedlings on sites that have a low potential for establishing competing vegetation the first several years after planting.
topsoil is typically placed into berms at the bottom of fill slopes or top of cut slopes and stored there until it is reapplied.
it is important to set a realistic post-construction target ph when considering liming because large quantities of lime are needed for even small changes in soil ph.
under these circumstances, the size of the topsoil pile can be quite large.
ideally, only the topsoil is removed in the excavation process.
all liming materials will raise soil ph, but not at the same level as pure limestone.
there may be a minimum topsoil depth below which the application of topsoil is not effective.
while this equipment will break up compaction in portions of the soil where the ripper tines have been dragged, it does not effectively fracture the compacted soil between the ripper tine paths (andrus and froehlich 1983).
these aggregates include hay, straw, or chipped and shredded wood materials.
branches, stems, bark, and root wads are typical waste products from clearing and grubbing that can be chipped or mulched on site to produce various types of wood mulch.
as the carbon sources become depleted, the high populations of soil microorganisms die and nitrogen is released for plant growth.
these figures can then be used to determine the rate of litter to be applied.
this creates a favorable environment for young seedlings by allowing sunlight to penetrate and protecting the young seedlings during the early stages of establishment.
large trucks can hold between 75 and 100 yards of mulch (a) while smaller trucks can hold up to 25 yards (c).
the squirreltail seeds are germinating from the heads of the seeds that came in the bales (b).
fertilizers are used to bring soil nutrients up to levels essential for establishing and maintaining a desired plant community.
nitrogen fertilizers are shown in table 10.2.
because of the limited application range, this equipment is limited to sites adjacent to roads.
bailey (2004) found that the application of 3 inches of topsoil over subsoil in eastern washington increased the presence of native species by a factor of four and increased vegetative ground cover the first and second year by 20%.
the tractor used to create imprints would compact the tilled soil leaving the surface smoother (less rough) than if left alone.
if applied at high enough rates, long fibers can overlap, creating continuous pores that will increase drainage rates.
mycorrhizal fungi form partnerships with most plant families, and three types of mycorrhizae are recognized: a. b. figure 10.32 — mycorrhizal fungi offer many benefits to the host plant.
needing approximately 33,000 ft2 of gabion wall facing, we prepared the erosion mats by rolling them out on a road surface, applying california fescue (festuca californica), gluing the seeds to the mat, and re-rolling the erosion mats.
this can be prevented by identifying these plant populations on site during the weed assessment (see section 5.8.2.1) and avoiding placing them into slash piles.
on the other hand, using a fast-release fertilizer with higher nitrogen analysis, such as ammonium nitrate (33% n), would reduce the amount of bulk fertilizer to 2,330 lb (769*100/33 = 2,330).
andrus and froehlich (1983) found that the winged subsoiler was a far more effective tool for breaking up compaction.
the particle size and shape of the organic source can also be important in slope hydrology by increasing infiltration and permeability rates.
the particle size of the liming material determines how quickly the ph of a soil will increase.
depending on soil characteristics, such as ph and clay content, some immobile nutrients will take years to move only a few inches from the point of fertilizer placement.
this material can come from many sources, such as subsoils, river sands, and terrace deposits.
the more surface area of the organic source, the faster decomposition will take place.
for seeding, application rates range from 100 yd3/ac (0.75-inch thickness) to 135 yd3/ac (1.0-inch thickness).
for example, straw from some grain production fields (e.g., rice straw) has seeds of species that are not adapted to wildland environments and therefore will not become established.
the large spaces or pores created by the wood strands allow space, light, and protection for young emerging seedlings (figure 10.13).
in exchange for this free "room-and-board", the mycorrhizal fungus offers benefits to the host plant: increased water and nutrient uptake — beneficial fungi help plants absorb mineral nutrients, especially phosphorus and micronutrients such as zinc and copper.
inorganic forms of slow-release fertilizers were developed for the horticulture and landscape industries where they have become an effective method of fertilizing nursery plants.
use of fine-grade inoculum through hydroseeding equipment is a recent application method that shows promise as a way to combine amf with seeds as they are sown.
large pores function much like the air spaces in building insulation by moderating extreme temperatures.
different patterns of steel "teeth" can be welded on the face of the bucket to achieve the desired surface micro-relief.
one of the primary purposes for tilling is to loosen compacted soils.
walker (2005) showed that slow-release fertilizers broadcasted three years after seedlings were planted, increased stem diameter and shoot volume over the control seedlings by 143% and 104% respectively five years after the fertilizer was applied.
it would be risky and wasteful considering the potential for leaching high amounts of nitrate through soil into the ground water or the possibility of creating high salt levels toxic to plant growth.
they are available in strips or rolls with a minimum thickness of 0.75 inch.
some ectomycorrhizal fungi products can be incorporated into the nursery growing media prior to sowing (figure 10.34a) or a liquid slurry of fungal spores can be applied during the growing season.
obtaining an even mulch depth is extremely difficult using this method, and requires many passes of the equipment that invariably compacts the soil.
calculating long-term nitrogen targets is covered insection 10.1.1.2.
the application rates for wood strands are likely to follow the guides for straw — at least 15% to 20% of the soil surface should be visible.
because it only loosens the soil surface several inches, the benefits for revegetation are only seen during seed germination and early seedling establishment.
dense stands of ponderosa pine can produce thick layers of litter.
the size of the sheet mulch must be large enough to keep competing vegetation away from the seedling.
this stubble contains varying quantities of unharvested seeds, which eventually end up in bales.
as with straw, this product is limited by the accessibility of the site by hay transportation and blowing equipment.
it should be noted that in many cases, uninoculated seedlings may eventually form a partnership with some kind offrankia or rhizobium strain after they are outplanted.
stable landforms are created that reduce surface erosion and increase slope stability (see section 5.6 and section 5.7).
each one of the nodules can house millions of bacteria.
the heat generated during composting effectively reduces pathogens, weeds, and insects that may be hazardous to humans and detrimental to reestablishing vegetation.
one design simply lifts and drops soil in place, shattering compacted soil in the process.
these tools are not designed to break up deep compaction.
figure 10.5 — an example of calculating fertilizer application rates to reduce nitrogen deficits.
in this example 1,900 lb/ac of limestone was needed to achieve the target ph (2,800 less 900).
the interior of large piles maintain higher temperatures and are usually anaerobic, which can be detrimental to soil microorganisms.
at the end of the assessment, calculate the number of seedlings per known volume or weight of litter material.
the extra water from these surfaces can support trees and shrubs.
because nitrogen-fixing plants are often "pioneer" species that are the first to colonize disturbed sites, they are ideal for revegetation or restoration projects.
immediately after a pass is made with the tillage equipment, the penetrometer is pushed into the soil and the depth to the compacted layer is recorded.
many nutrients become fixed in the soils and their availability is dependent on highly variable factors such as soil texture, ph, and placement in the soil.
achieving good shatter at deeper soil depths requires that tillage equipment be adjusted for site-specific soil conditions, especially soil texture, soil moisture, and large rock content.
in this example, total soil nitrogen is determined from soil tests.
sufficient topsoil quantities however, are rarely available in the quantities needed to restore disturbed sites to their original topsoil depths.
improving seed germination and reducing surface erosion can be accomplished through the application of mulches, which is detailed insection 10.1.3, mulches.
erosion control revegetative mats (ecrm) or rolled erosion controlled products (recp) are applied directly to the soil surface for control of sheet erosion and to aid the establishment of vegetation.
establish test plots at sites that are representative of each revegetation unit (these can be reference sites).
on sites where fertilizers containing immobile nutrients cannot be incorporated, an alternative is to create roughened soil surfaces (seesection 10.1.2, tillage ) prior to fertilizer application.
the remaining deficit to meet long-term nitrogen targets would be approximately 644 lb/ac, which must be supplied through later applications of fertilizer or other carriers of nitrogen (topsoil, compost, biosolids, wood waste, mulch, and nitrogen-fixing plants).
nursery pot culture — this option is only viable in a nursery when plants are being grown for a specific restoration project, and is unique to amf fungi because of their wide host range.
measurements are taken every 6 inches across a small transect perpendicular to the direction of the tractor and spanning the width of the tillage disturbance.
some agricultural spreaders, called fertilizer banders or injectors, are designed to place fertilizer, or other soil amendments including mycorrhizae, at varying depths in the soil.
each container of fertilizer will have a label with a stated "guaranteed analysis" that indicates the percentage of each nutrient contained in the fertilizer (figure 10.3).
hydroseeding equipment can be used to apply fertilizer in the same operation with seeds, tackifiers, and hydromulch (seesection 10.3.2, hydroseeding).
seesection 10.1.3.9 for more information on straw and hay.
verifying the effectiveness of amf inoculation — unlike ecm, amf are not visible to the unaided eye.
this equipment has varying transport capacities, ranging from 25 to 100 yards of material (figure 10.20).
this is a highly effective technique for propagating amf in the nursery and could also be used on the planting site.
ecm species have airborne spores that can reinoculate soils naturally over time, or the spores can be harvested and used to inoculate nursery stock.
an alternative is to deliver several yards of mulch to a planting island in the bucket or shovel of a tractor or excavator.
while this is an extremely high rate, consider the application of ammonium nitrate at 100% first year release, which would supply 769 lb/ac (line a) of immediately available nitrogen.
salt damage can be reduced by mixing fast-release fertilizers at lower concentrations or by applying them during rainy weather.
laboratories can provide a live spore count which is the best measure of inoculum quality.
these nutrients often become immobilized at the soil surface and are very slow to move into the rooting zone where they can be accessed.
the resultant inoculum can then be incorporated into growing media or planting beds before seeds or cuttings are sown.
as discussed in section 5.5.5, many nutrients are tied up in low ph and high ph soils.
finer grade inoculums (figure 10.37b), which are more expensive, may be mixed with water and applied directly onto seeds or as a root dip.
it is often better to concentrate limited resources in key areas where resources can be most effective, rather than spread them across the larger project area and dilute them to the point of having little benefit to reestablishing native vegetation.
for this reason, a high cec soil requires more liming material to raise it to the same ph level.
this is a far greater quantity than if the objective was to increase nutrient supply, which would require 2 inches of compost added to the top 12 inches of soil.
a half point ph difference in this case can result in an increase of over 1,000 lb/ac in application rates.
the end product is stabilized to the point that it is beneficial to plant growth (alexander 2003a, 2003b).
for instance, a lime material passing a 100-mesh screen reacts faster and takes less quantity than material passing a 50-mesh screen.
it is a reasonable assumption that unless the soils are sandy or very rocky, that all nutrients, aside from nitrate or ammonium forms of nitrogen, are relatively unavailable the first year after application.
they are based on laboratory test results of the compost and threshold nitrogen levels obtained from reference sites.
for verification, it is recommended that plant samples be sent to a laboratory where they can also provide a numerical rating of inoculation effectiveness.
on projects where soil disturbance will be minimal, or where healthy topsoil is still present and contains functional communities of beneficial microorganisms, reintroducing the organisms will usually not be necessary.
figure 10.1 — threshold values are determined from reference sites.
first, organic mulches can be applied over a much larger area than sheet mulches.
less materials with high cce (seesection 10.1.6.3) are required as compared to low cce materials.
g n deficit: f - e = 769 lbs/ac minimum amount of n to apply to bring up to threshold figure 10.2 — determining the amount of nitrogen (n) needed to bring soils up to a nitrogen threshold can be calculated from equations shown in this spreadsheet.
for example, incorporating organic matter also loosens compacted soils and roughens soil surfaces.
collect ripe fruiting bodies of mushrooms (figure 10.33b), puffballs, or truffles (figure 10.33c) from beneath healthy plants.
as ratios dip below 15:1, nitrogen becomes available for plant uptake.
this is an effective means of applying seeds and seed covering in one operation.
the valleys become the catch basins for seeds and surface runoff.
the host plant roots provide a convenient substrate for the fungus, and also supply food in the form of simple carbohydrates.
the long awns of the squirreltail seeds (a) show how difficult collecting and handling these seeds can be.
the micro-topography of a roughened surface consists of discontinuous ridges and valleys.
consider placing a plastic covering over the piles to keep moisture out during the winter because wet mulch is harder to apply through a mulch blower than drier mulch.
spores will not easily pass through irrigation injectors or nozzles, and do not move downward or through the soil into the soil with water.
a. b. figure 10.41 — nitrogen-fixing bacteria are commercially available as pure culture inoculant, often in a carrier (a), or can be prepared by collecting nodules off of plants from the wild (b).
as the vegetation develops over the next few years, the ability of the plant community to take up more available nutrients increases and the fertilizer rates would be gradually increased.
if rates exceed 3,500 ms/cm, then diluting the solution or applying the fertilizer during rainy weather is advised.
after the seedlings are planted, mulch can be hand raked at the specified thickness to cover the island.
the quantity of cubic yards of topsoil required per acre can be determined based on the depth of topsoil from figure 10.25.
metamorphic soils reacted positively to both treatments and maintained high permeability rates after three rainfall events.
several small plots using different erosion mats, seed mixes, seed rates and seed-attaching methods were tested to determine how to best meet the revegetation objectives (figure 10.21).
high levels of soluble fertilizers may inhibit their presence.
for example, raising an existing soil ph of 5.5 to ph 6.5 takes nearly twice the amount of lime necessary to raise it to ph 6.0.
this often leads to applying topsoil too thinly across a project site.
fresh piles of wood fiber have the potential to spontaneously ignite in larger piles, creating a fire hazard and potential loss of material.
figure 10.20 — wood fiber mulch is applied on steeper slopes with mulch blowing equipment.
separation of duff and litter from the topsoil prior to topsoil excavation should be considered when the duff and litter are to be used as a native seed source or soil cover.
once root systems hit the hard compacted layer several inches below the loosened surface, plant growth is curtailed.
if the post-construction surface soils have a lower ph than the reference site topsoils, then liming can be used to raise ph. on a project where topsoil is removed and not replaced, the difference between the ph of the topsoil and the subsoil should be determined.
soil compaction and removal of topsoil which is routine during road construction is particularly detrimental to beneficial soil microorganisms.
figure 10.23 — straw blowers range in size from machines which can apply 30 to 60 bales per hour (shown here) to very large straw blowers that can shoot up to 20 tons per hour.
straw, hay, and short-fibered wood products are less likely to be present after the first year.
as a rule, the deeper topsoil is applied, the higher the site productivity will be.
a. c. d. figure 10.39 — nitrogen-fixing bacteria include rhizobium that forms relationships with plants in the legume family including lupines (a), and clovers (b) and frankia that forms relationships with other non-leguminous plants such as snowbrush ceanothus (c), and mountain-avens (d) .
as discussed in previous sections, it is important to understand the characteristics of the reference site topsoils and try to recreate these conditions after construction.
recalculating fertilizer rates using a more realistic rate of 50 lb/ac available nitrogen needed the first year after application (line f), bulk fertilizer application rates would be 1,563 lb/ac (line h).
short-fibered mulches, on the other hand, have smaller pores and form denser seed covers.
they are darker in appearance than fresh sources, but the appearance of the original organic source can still be discerned (e.g., needles or leaves are still identifiable).
the combined c:n of soil and incorporated organic matter gives an indication of how the type and rate of incorporated organic matter will affect the soil c:n. an amended soil with a high c:n will have a longer immobilization period than a soil with a lower c:n. size and shape of organic matter.
a soil with a clay loam texture requires over 3 times more lime to raise the ph from 5.0 to 6.0 than a sandy soil.
application of amf inoculants — because amf spores are relatively large, ensuring that spores come in direct contact with the root systems or seeds is critical.
high levels of soluble fertilizers may inhibit their presence.
when wind is favorable, straw can be shot up to 100 ft.
for long and contiguous terraces, concentrated water from high runoff events can flow down the terraces (assuming they are not completely level), potentially causing gullies.
figure 10.20 — wood fiber mulch is applied on steeper slopes with mulch blowing equipment.
"water soluble" or "available" nutrients do not always remain available or soluble after they are applied to the soil.
with some fungi, the mantle completely covers fragile root tips (figure 10.32a) and acts as a physical barrier from drying, other pests, and toxic soil contaminants.
these features are unsightly and can deliver high quantities of sediment to watercourses.
sowing that is done before mulching can be accomplished through dryland sowing methods or through hydroseeding.
for this reason, many fine-textured materials, such as composts, are actually excellent growing media for weed seed germination and establishment.
10.1.3.9 straw and hay straw and hay are long-fibered mulches used on many revegetation projects for seed cover and erosion control (figure 10.18e).
the high moisture around the stem can be conducive to pathogenic injury.
soil on restoration sites, however, may not contain the proper species of bacteria to form a symbiotic partnership with the plant.
then, rinse and pulverize them in a blender for several minutes to make a slurry.
therefore, use of nitrogen-fixing plants can be an important part of accelerating rehabilitation of degraded land.
the unit consists of three winged ripper tines capable of extending 12 to 34 inches below the draw bar.
these soil bacteria live underground in moist, dark conditions with relatively stable, cool temperatures.
fall application of fertilizers should be done at lower rates and early enough for nutrients to be utilized by the growing vegetation.
therefore inoculant must be introduced in the nursery for nursery-grown plant materials, or introduced at the time of sowing for seeds that are sown directly at the field site.
the quality of the litter for erosion control and longevity varies by the dominant forest or shrub species.
tilling with these objectives requires equipment that mixes soil, such as plows, tillers, disks, chisels, and soil spaders.
when applied within a soil fertility strategy, using fertilizer can be a great tool for revegetation.
this way, inoculant need only be purchased once for each plant species grown, and thereafter, crude inoculant can be made from nodules.
mycorrhizae increase the root surface area, and the fungal hyphae access water and nutrients beyond the roots (figure 10.32a).
because this type of inoculum is made from pure fungal cultures and does not store well, it is rarely available from suppliers.
the excavator in this example can move topsoil in place, shape the cut and fill slopes, and imprint the surface, all with one operation.
this is particularly true for compacted soils and those that have been removed and stockpiled.
determining rates of organic matter needed to improve nutrient status can follow the process outlined for calculating fertilizer rates insection 10.1.1.2 .
this rate was subsequently reduced to 639 lb/ac to compensate for the volume of rock fragments and the shallow incorporation depth (3 inches instead of 7 inches).
the surface had been left rough so that, over time, some of the liming materials would naturally become incorporated into the surface through soil movement.
installing small test plots of varying thicknesses of mulch would be a good means to determine the appropriate thickness for optimum seed germination.
where slopes gradients are gentle and free of rock and debris, wood fiber mulch can be evenly applied with a manure spreader.
figuring out which products will serve your project needs at the right price can be challenging.
in 2003, we applied our findings to the construction project.
visit the plots during the spring and count the number of seeds that are germinating.
good integration of erosion control and revegetation planning can eliminate the need for last minute purchase and application of unknown or undesirable hay or straw sources.
third, as with all slopes being revegetated, concentrated water should be kept off these slopes.
however, if equipment is not available for mixing on steep sites, applying very fine liming materials through hydroseeding equipment is a possible way of raising ph.
in exchange for this free "room-and-board", the mycorrhizal fungus offers benefits to the host plant: increased water and nutrient uptake — beneficial fungi help plants absorb mineral nutrients, especially phosphorus and micronutrients such as zinc and copper.
some native grass species grown for seed production are very difficult to harvest and clean.
the basic components of a manufactured topsoil are the loam borrow, compost, and soil amendments (e.g., fertilizer or lime amendment).
the advantages of fast-release fertilizers are they are relatively inexpensive, easy to handle, immediately available to the plant, and can be applied through a range of fertilizer spreading equipment.
seesection 10.1.5, organic matter amendments, for more information on composts.
figure 10.16 — sheet mulches come in a variety of materials, such as the paper/cardboard product shown in this picture.
spring applications of fast-release fertilizers are more effective than fall application because of the higher nutrient requirements of growing plants during that period (figure 10.6f).
the bacteria live in nodules on roots of the plant.
because disturbance and exposure to direct sunlight may kill these beneficial fungi, soil inoculation must be done as quickly as possible.
figure 10.6 — fertilizers should be applied during seasons, and at rates and formulations that release nutrients when native plants can efficiently draw them from the soil.
the results from this test are reported in a table that includes the quantity of lime needed to raise the soil sample to ph 7.
however, there is no guarantee that the plants will still be colonized when they are planted at the project site.
in the process of removing and reapplying topsoil, soils undergo a loss of 1) soil aggregation, 2) organic nitrogen, 3) arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (amf) inoculum, and 4) microbial biomass carbon (visser and others 1984).
e. once vegetation has become established, plant growth will take place in the fall.
litter from shrub plant communities provides less protection because the leaves are less interlocking.
the process for developing a fertilizer prescription follows these steps: the fertilizer prescription is the basic instructions for ordering and applying fertilizers.
when considering purchasing compost or any other type of organic matter from a manufacturer, it is important to request the latest lab analysis.
on most highly disturbed sites, nitrogen is most likely to be deficient.
if the post-construction surface soils have a lower ph than the reference site topsoils, then liming can be used to raise ph.
the rating system is called calcium carbonate equivalent (cce).
the smp test is well adapted for soils with ph values below 5.8 and containing less than 10% organic matter (mclean 1973).
this section will discuss the agricultural equipment that can be used for wildland revegetation as well as equipment specifically developed for these extreme conditions.
runoff strips capture concentrated runoff into small ponds or catchment basins.
finding host plants on recovered reference sites can give an indication of whether they grow on disturbances, and consequently how much nitrogen will be fixed on the site.
products such as guar and plantago are used with low quantities of hydromulch to bind straw together (manufacturers have stated application rates for this purpose).straw can also be crimped, rolled, or punched into the soil.
the time required to make these trips can sometimes be longer than the actual application of the mulch.
mulching around seedlings results in the greatest benefit on hot and dry sites (typically south and west aspects) and sites with aggressive competing vegetation.
implement must be capable of achieving maximum fracture of compacted soils (minimum 24 inches) in one pass (adapted from wenatchee national forest contract specifications).
10.1.6.4 determine liming rates determining how much liming material to apply is based on these factors: soil texture.
rippers have also been adapted to increase soil lift between tine paths by welding wide metal wings to the bottom of each tine.
they are designed into such revegetation projects as obliterated roads, view corridors, waste areas, and other highly disturbed sites.
it is very important to be sure of the quality of the material.
this is the pounds of nutrient in an acre of soil on the post-construction site.
coarse-textured materials (figure 10.18) have greater longevity than finer-textured materials because coarser materials have less surface area for microbial break down (slick and curtis 1985).
high concentrations of fast-release fertilizers can also affect germination rates (figure 10.4) because of the high soluble salt levels (brooks and blaser 1964; carr and ballard 1979).
crude inoculant is made from nodules collected from roots of nitrogen-fixing plants of the same species to be inoculated.
utilizing periodic soil analysis can give the revegetation specialist a better understanding of the soil nitrogen status.
however, higher nutrient levels are more desirable.
poorly applied erosion mats can result in sheet and rill erosion under the fabric.
in the examples shown in these two figures, the topsoil was removed, leaving a gravelly, sandy loam subsoil at the surface.
optimum environments for decomposition include high moisture, warm temperatures, and available nutrients, all conditions present in most topsoil piles.
it is important that these tests be run by sta laboratories.
these three nutrients are considered most important for long-term site recovery.
in addition, a combination of fertilizers can be easily mixed in the hydroseed tank and applied at relatively even proportions because they are in a solution.
there can be other seeds in the bales that, while not considered weeds by the certifying state, might nevertheless be unwanted on your site.
a healthy population of soil microorganisms can also maintain ecological balance, preventing the onset of major problems from viruses or other pathogens that reside in the soil.
mulch blowing equipment can be used on any slope gradient that can be accessed by foot.
in this analysis, 500 pounds of fertilizer in this analysis would deliver 105 lbs n, 25 lbs p2o5 ,100 lb k2o, 0.1 lbs b, 0.05 lbs cu, and so on.
placing 3 or more tines together (c) can be more effective than one tine, but tine spacing should not be too far apart or soils between the tines will not be shattered (d).
rippers and subsoilers are not very effective in incorporating materials such as fertilizers or organic matter into the soil.
attached to the arm of an excavator, this equipment can reach 35 feet up and down slope and specifically rip targeted areas of compacted soil (figure 10.10).
however, the quality of commercial sources can be variable so it is important to verify the quality of the inoculum.
planting islands will generally occupy less than a quarter to a third of the entire site, leaving the remainder as "inter-island."
loam borrow should have low coarse fragment content, not restrict plant growth, and be weed-free.
if viable seed rates are high in the litter and duff, and it does not contain large material, it can be applied in a variety of ways (e.g., hydroseeder, mulch blowing equipment).
when this happens, immobile nutrients are accessible by roots and nutrient uptake is possible.
to increase the rate of decomposition, the piles should be moved several times a year to add oxygen.
unless the seeds are extremely small, sowing seeds over installed erosion mats is not recommended because larger seeds will hang up in the fabric.
since liming materials are relatively insoluble in water, surface applications of lime, without some degree of soil mixing, renders the lime ineffective for immediate correction of subsoil acidity.
tablets or packets can be placed in the planting hole (figure 10.34b).
seed germination and plant establishment phase — traditionally, fast-release fertilizers have often been applied at high rates in the fall during the seed sowing operation.
soils under thick mulches take longer to warm in the spring, but in the fall, take longer to cool down.
if roadside soils are colder than 70 °f, nutrient release will take longer than what the manufacturer states.
only a fraction of native species are nitrogen-fixing host plants.
the benefits of this practice are erosion control and maintenance of mycorrhizae inoculum through the presence of live roots.
in addition, long-fibered mulches can mitigate the effects of frost heaving at the soil surface (kay 1978), significantly reduce high surface temperatures (slick and curtis 1985), and allow sunlight penetration, which enhances seed germination and seedling establishment.
tests of inoculation effectiveness have shown significant differences between products (c).
conifer seedlings, for example, require very specific ectomycorrhizal fungi for successful inoculation.
inset 10.8 — cation exchange capacity (cec) the capacity of a soil to hold positive ions (referred to as bases or cations) is called the cation exchange capacity (cec).
they also cover how to determine the quality of the plant materials and how to care for them during storage and transportation.
if these materials are not used immediately, they should be placed in small piles and completely covered by plastic to keep the materials dry.
composts are very suitable materials for increasing the water-holding capacity of sandy soils, increasing nutrient supply, and enhancing soil infiltration and permeability rates.
when c:n is greater than 15:1, available nitrogen is immobilized.
erosion mats can perform well as seed covers (see section 10.1.3.8).
where topsoil quantities are limiting, it is important to develop a strategy that addresses the location the topsoil will be spread and the depth at which it will be applied.
once seedlings begin to nodulate, nodules from their roots can serve as the basis for making crude inoculant as described below.
nevertheless, these materials should not be overlooked because they can be a source for seeds and nutrients.
there is also variation in mulches based on species of origin.
to keep testing costs low, only available nitrogen and total nitrogen need to be tested (seesection 5.5 for soil sampling and testing methods).
if undesirable plant species are included in the slash piles, spread of these species is likely to occur when they are processed and applied as a mulch.
maintaining the trial for two years showed that california fescue outperformed blue wild rye.
to make your own crude inoculant, select healthy, vigorous plants of the same species as the plants to be inoculated.
the strategy behind planting islands is to create an ideal growing environment for tree and shrub seedlings that replicates the natural patterns or features observed in the surrounding landscape and plant communities (figure 10.47).
for this reason, a high cec soil requires more liming material to raise it to the same ph level.
incorporating soil improvement strategies into these structures will stabilize the soil and capture runoff water, making them very suitable to the establishment of a range of native vegetation (seesection 10.3.3 and section 10.3.4).
inoculating plants ensures that "nitrogen-fixing" plants form an effective partnership to fix nitrogen.
high c:n materials are also a longer-term energy source to soil organisms that help create a stable soil structure.
excessive moisture can turn the piles into compost and possibly affect seed viability.
generalized curves shown in figure 10.30 were used to determine the amount of limestone to add to raise the ph. on the baseline of the graph, rates of limestone in lb/ac that correspond to the surface soil ph (c = 900) and the target ph (d = 2,800) were determined from ph levels located on the sandy loam curve.
it is best to excavate topsoil when soils are relatively dry.
large undecomposed wood can significantly reduce soil water storage due to low water-holding capacity of the material.
the amount of limestone to apply (e) is 1,900 lb/ac, which is calculated by subtracting 900 (c) from 2,800 (d).
the long stems of these materials create loft, or high porosity, that keeps moisture near the soil surface where seeds are germinating.
the same characteristics that create an optimum environment for seed germination in other mulches are also important to consider when selecting erosion mats.
because these mycorrhizal associations involve unique species of fungi, few commercial inoculants are available and the best option is to use soil from around healthy plants.
if these materials are not used immediately, they should be placed in small piles and completely covered by plastic to keep the materials dry.
generalized curves shown in figure 10.30 were used to determine the amount of limestone to add to raise the ph. on the baseline of the graph, rates of limestone in lb/ac that correspond to the surface soil ph (c = 900) and the target ph (d = 2,800) were determined from ph levels located on the sandy loam curve.
a. b. figure 10.36 — because of their wide host range, amf fungi can be raised on host plants (a) and their roots chopped-up for inoculum (b).
if salvaged in this manner, small piles are created and soil is minimally handled.
when the duff, litter, and seed bank is collected and spread on disturbed sites the environmental conditions for breaking seed dormancy of some species may be met and seeds will germinate.
the thicker erosion mats with the most loft should have better conditions for seedling establishment than thinner materials.
nitrogen-fixing species are usually outplanted in order to help restore fertility and organic matter to the project site.
some manufactured inoculants contain select strains, tested for forming optimally productive partnerships with their host species.
the host plant roots provide a convenient substrate for the fungus, and also supply food in the form of simple carbohydrates.
this type of equipment includes rock rippers, subsoilers, and "winged" subsoilers.
figure 10.24 — soil testing of salvaged topsoil can be used to calculate the thickness to apply in order to meet minimum nitrogen levels.
usually this equipment has a ripping shank or tine that loosens the soil, followed by a tube that drops the fertilizer, and coulters or rollers that close up the furrow.
long, shredded wood fiber, for example, can create long passageways for water.
plays a role in how quickly organic matter breaks down in the soil.
the particle size of the liming material determines how quickly the ph of a soil will increase.
five to ten grams (about 0.2—0.4 ounce) of manufactured inoculant can inoculate about 500 seedlings, usually exceeding the recommended 100,000 bacteria per seedling.
at this release rate, 308 lb/ac of nitrogen would become available the first year after application (line f).
the four guides insection 10.3, installing plant materials, cover the techniques for sowing seed, installing cuttings, and planting seedlings.
on the whole, however, slow-release fertilizers have greater applicability for revegetating disturbed sites than fast-release fertilizers.
these include the type of tillage equipment used, penetration depth, soil moisture during tillage, soil texture, presence of topsoil, and organic matter content.
each plot should be well marked (each corner identified with stakes and permanent labels identifying the litter source) and located where it will not be disturbed.
ecm species have airborne spores that can reinoculate soils naturally over time, or the spores can be harvested and used to inoculate nursery stock.
liming is not an easy operation on drastically disturbed lands.
when purchasing and installing sheet mulches, the following should be considered (after davies 1988a, 1988b): figure 10.15 — erosion mats can be good seed covers.
straw and hay are long-fibered mulches used on many revegetation projects for seed cover and erosion control (figure 10.18e).
identifying the objectives for the project will lead to selecting and effectively using the appropriate equipment to achieve the desired soil conditions (table 10.3).
first, the surface of the soil must be smoothed to a uniform elevation before the mat is placed.
product specifications date of inoculum application will be within one year of production date.
the seeds that are contained in the straw may not always be considered inappropriate for use in revegetation projects.
when litter and duff are collected, they should be matched to the appropriate revegetation site.
if topsoil and organic matter are not available on the project site, spores or commercial inoculants can be used instead.
the simplest excavator attachment is the bucket which can be used to move topsoil or organic matter to concentrated locations and creating mounds or planting islands (see section 10.1.8).
while topsoiling has many beneficial effects for revegetation, topsoiling cannot recreate the original undisturbed soil.
labels can also be obtained from the manufacturer or fertilizer representatives.
the large plants shown in this photograph are lupines, which are nitrogen-fixing (a).
when performed correctly, tillage can increase porosity in the rooting zone, increase infiltration rates, and increase surface roughness.
as soon as possible after collection (within a few hours), put the nodules in a blender with clean, chlorine-free water.
soil — topsoil, humus or duff from beneath ecm host plants can be used for inoculum if done properly.
soil organic matter (in humus form) has a high cec and requires more lime material to raise the ph. percentage of rock fragments.
second, organic aggregate mulches moderate surface soil temperatures, whereas sheet mulches can actually increase surface temperatures.
spring applications also have less risk of damaging vegetation through fertilizer salts because precipitation in the spring is typically frequent enough to wash fertilizers from the foliage.
nitrogen based fertilizers can be applied to offset higher soil c:n and make soil nitrogen available for plant growth.
mycorrhizae increase the root surface area, and the fungal hyphae access water and nutrients beyond the roots (figure 10.32a).
an application hose is positioned where mulch is to be applied and is pneumatically delivered from the mulch bins to the site.
by comparing post-construction nutrient values against threshold values, the nutrient deficit can be estimated for each nutrient.
when plants lack mycorrhizae, they become stunted and sometimes chlorotic ("yellow") in appearance.
more open forest stands on dry, less productive sites will have thinner layers of duff and litter (often less than an inch deep).
10.1.6.2 set ph targets it is important to set a realistic post-construction target ph when considering liming because large quantities of lime are needed for even small changes in soil ph.
this equipment can also be used solely to apply fertilizers, especially after vegetation has become established.
the site was on a very steep slope where incorporating the limestone was not feasible (see section 10.1.6.5).
conifer seedlings, for example, require very specific ectomycorrhizal fungi for successful inoculation.
available forms of phosphorus, for instance, react in the soil to form less soluble compounds; potassium gets bound up in soils with moderate to high proportions of clay; and many of the micronutrients (e.g., zinc, copper, manganese) become unavailable when applied to soils with low ph (seesection 5.5.5).
it is therefore important that mulch be free of large pieces of wood.
for large jobs, using a straw blower is the most practical application method.
the inter-islands will be much less productive than the planting islands.
applying wood fiber mulch — wood fiber mulch is typically applied with mulch-blowing equipment.
for seeding, application rates range from 100 yd3/ac (0.75-inch thickness) to 135 yd3/ac (1.0-inch thickness).
conserving and utilizing healthy topsoil will also help to sustain the natural populations of beneficial microorganisms.
other ectomycorrhizal fungal inoculums are applied at the time of planting and here the objective is to get the inoculum in contact with the plant roots.
the characteristics of mulch materials that make ideal seed coverings are those that protect seeds from drying winds, solar radiation, high evapotranspiration rates, and surface erosion while still allowing seeds to germinate and grow through the mulch into healthy seedlings.
the non-topsoiled areas could be treated with other mitigating measures, such as organic matter incorporation or mulching.
this method is advantageous on steep slopes or soil-faced gabion walls (inset 10.3) where placing seed prior to mat installation is very difficult.
applying too much straw will restrict sunlight and growing space for establishing seedlings.
conserving existing topsoil and organic matter is a key practice to protect existing populations of beneficial microorganisms.
studies have shown that stored topsoil can remain viable from 6 months (claassen and zasoski 1994) to several years (miller and may 1979; visser, fujikawa, and others 1984; visser, griffiths, and others 1984,) but will decrease in viability after 5 years (miller and may 1979;
finer grade inoculums (figure 10.37b), which are more expensive, may be mixed with water and applied directly onto seeds or as a root dip.
there are many examples where, in the urgency of erosion control, straw or hay from unknown sources was applied, resulting in the introduction of weed species.
a high c:n might be beneficial to soil aeration and water movement because it does not break down as fast as material with lower c:n.
nitrogen-fixing bacteria form nodules on roots of certain plants (figure 10.38a) and accumulate nitrogen from the air (figure 10.38b).
the finer the material, the faster soil ph will increase.
a high c:n might be beneficial to soil aeration and water movement because it does not break down as fast as material with lower c:n.
some researchers suggest that very fine textured mulches can actually increase surface evaporation by wicking moisture from the soil to the surface of the mulch (slick and curtis 1985; borland 1990; bainbridge and others 2001).
fertilizers — it is difficult to evenly apply fertilizers through a mulch blower system.
typically, those materials that protect the seeds from drying out but allow light and space for germinating seeds to grow into seedlings will perform the best for revegetation establishment.
if the objective is to restore a site to its original productivity, the placement of topsoil should be at a depth equal to or greater than the topsoil horizon of undisturbed reference sites.
soil inoculum can also be collected under the same plant species adjacent to the project site (figure 10.33a).
signs include: post-planting care — several factors are of primary concern when using inoculants for nitrogen-fixing bacteria: in nature, communities of bacteria, fungi, algae, protozoa, and other microorganisms in the soil make nutrients available to plants, create channels for water and air, maintain soil structure, and cycle nutrients and organic matter.
when litter and duff are collected, they should be matched to the appropriate revegetation site.
general equipment types examples feedstock particle geometry chippers disc chippers, drum chippers whole logs, clean residuals clean edge, two-sided hogs swing hammer, fixed hammer, punch & die, mass rotor wood waste, stumps, land clearing debris coarse, multi-surfaced, fibrous shredders low speed-high torque, high speed wood waste, stumps, land clearing debris coarse, multi-surfaced, fibrous hybrids knife hogs, pan & disc wood waste, stumps, land clearing debris semi-coarse table 10.5 — table of general types of wood waste reduction equipment (modified from re-sourcing associates and cpm consultants 1997).
fertilizers — it is difficult to evenly apply fertilizers through a mulch blower system.
as ratios dip below 15:1, nitrogen becomes available for plant uptake.
wood fiber mulch production — creating mulch from right-of-way clearing woody material requires planning and coordination.
during the assessment phase of the revegetation plan, a topsoil survey should be conducted to determine the depth and quality of the topsoil that will be excavated (see section 5.5.1).
figure 10.43 — integrating soil improvement, site stability, and water harvesting is critical when designing topographic enhancement features.
total n in post-construction soils was 650 lb/ac (c), making these soils deficient by 450 lb/ac.
it is important, therefore, to incorporate liming materials into the soil at the depth where the ph change is desired.
for example, straw from some grain production fields (e.g., rice straw) has seeds of species that are not adapted to wildland environments and therefore will not become established.
products such as guar and plantago are used with low quantities of hydromulch to bind straw together (manufacturers have stated application rates for this purpose).straw can also be crimped, rolled, or punched into the soil.
unlike pathogenic fungi, mycorrhizae will never show signs of root decay and the mycelia around the root will be visible.
a minimum depth that has been shown to control evaporation is one inch (slick and curtis 1985).
mulch can create problems to planted seedlings if it is placed in contact with the plant stem.
the more organic matter that is applied, the longer the immobilization.
this product raises ph faster, and depending on the soil type, can move a short distance into the soil surface.
needles from species such as douglas-fir are shorter and tend to compact, providing less surface stability.
unlike straw, these materials keep their structure or porosity over time, and do not compress with snow or lose fiber strength through decomposition.
at this depth, nitrogen would be out of range of most establishing root systems.
since the installed costs of erosion mats can be very expensive, it is important that the job is done right.
the agents responsible for release of nutrients from organic fertilizers are decomposing soil bacteria.
cation exchange capacity is directly related to the amount of clay and organic matter present in the soil — the higher the clay or organic matter content, the higher the cec.
whichever form is used, care should be taken when handling nitrogen-fixing bacteria inoculants because they are very perishable.
turf reinforcement mats (trm) are materials that are filled with soil when installed to increase surface soil strength (kemp 2006).
for example, if an average of 10 inches of topsoil is required on a project, approximately 1,350 yd3/ac topsoil would be needed.
during the summer or fall, identify plant species and count individual plants in the plots.
there can be other seeds in the bales that, while not considered weeds by the certifying state, might nevertheless be unwanted on your site.
aged organic sources have not typically undergone extensive heating, like composts, and they can contain seeds of undesirable weeds.
hydroseeding equipment, however, is probably the best method for spreading liming materials, especially very fine liming materials.
topsoil layers are typically removed with either the blade of a tractor or excavator bucket.
because of the potential for introducing weeds to your project site, you must be very certain of the species present in the hay or straw you are applying to your site.
the assumption in most of these cases was that short-term control of soil erosion and sediment production outweighed the long-term introduction of undesirable plant species.
so fertilizer granules are uniformly distributed within the soil and accessible by root systems.
several studies have indicated that it can take more than a decade for surface-applied lime (not incorporated) to raise soil ph to a depth of 6 inches (havlin and others 1999).
yet erosion control products and practices that are effective for controlling surface erosion are not always optimal for establishing vegetation.
this is an effective means of applying seeds and seed covering in one operation.
tilling is used to incorporate fertilizers, organic matter, lime, and other amendments evenly throughout the soil, while loosening compacted soils.
in the examples shown in these two figures, the topsoil was removed, leaving a gravelly, sandy loam subsoil at the surface.
in this operation, equipment is brought to each slash pile and materials in these piles are processed into mulch.
when terraces are filled with growing media (topsoil or amended subsoil) and planted, they are referred to as planting pockets (figure 10.44).
the rate at which the metering system delivers seeds can be adjusted and must be calibrated prior to mulching to obtain the desired seed density (seesection 10.3.1, seeding, for seed calibration methods).
rates can be set below 25 lb/ac when applying fertilizer with seeds.
"ammonium" and "nitrate" forms of nitrogen are also indications of fast-release fertilizers.
this equipment meters seeds into the mulch as it is being applied.
placement of seeds at the surface of the gabion wall was problematic.
the time required to make these trips can sometimes be longer than the actual application of the mulch.
nitrogen based fertilizers can be applied to offset higher soil c:n and make soil nitrogen available for plant growth.
mulch blowing equipment can be used on any slope gradient that can be accessed by foot.
the large spaces or pores created by the wood strands allow space, light, and protection for young emerging seedlings (figure 10.13).
however, the timing can result in ineffective and wasteful use of fertilizers (figure 10.6b) (dancer 1975).
this is because finer textured soils and organic matter have a higher propensity to attract and store bases released from liming materials (inset 10.8).
put nodules in a plastic bag or container and place them in a cooler for protection from direct sunlight and heat.
by incorporating several rates of organic matter on plots in disturbed reference sites near the project, the infiltration rates of each treatment could be determined using rainfall simulation equipment.
note: the higher rates used for mulching seedlings are only used in close proximity to the plants.
placement of seeds at the surface of the gabion wall was problematic.
to confirm inoculation, plant roots must be stained so that the fungal hyphae are visible under a microscope (d).
all sites have a minimum, or threshold, level of nutrients that must be met for each plant community to become functioning and self-sustaining (seesection 5.5).
back to top agricultural lime is used when soil ph of a disturbed site needs to be raised to improve plant survival and establishment (see section 5.5.5, ph and salts).
some ectomycorrhizal fungi products can be incorporated into the nursery growing media prior to sowing (figure 10.34a) or a liquid slurry of fungal spores can be applied during the growing season.
by incorporating several rates of organic matter on plots in disturbed reference sites near the project, the infiltration rates of each treatment could be determined using rainfall simulation equipment.
these strategies include: on projects where soil disturbance will be minimal, or where healthy topsoil is still present and contains functional communities of beneficial microorganisms, reintroducing the organisms will usually not be necessary.
the gabion walls were built in the summer of 2003, but the seeds did not germinate until late fall after several rainstorms.
the short-fibered textures typically form a covering that is too thin to maintain moisture around the seeds during germination when the weather is dry.
the resulting equipment is called the "winged" subsoiler (figure 10.8).
it was therefore decided to place the lime on the surface of the soil through hydroseeding operations.
the material must be well-composted, or stable, which can be indirectly determined by a respirometry test or calculated using c:n obtained from laboratory testing of nitrogen and organic matter.
the trial shown in this picture compared straw mat (a and b) with a polywoven mat (c and d).
on the other hand, the spores of amf species are large and released underground and so cannot reinoculate plants very quickly.
good integration of erosion control and revegetation planning can eliminate the need for last minute purchase and application of unknown or undesirable hay or straw sources.
dense stands of ponderosa pine can produce thick layers of litter.
stockpiled topsoil has been compared to "diffuse composting systems" (visser, fujikawa, and others 1984) because, under optimum conditions, organic material in the topsoil will compost.
if the last operation on a construction site is to subsoil or rip soils 1.5 to 2 ft deep and leave the soil surface in a roughened condition prior to revegetation, trackwalking would be more detrimental than beneficial on most soils.
at this new rate, the site would have sufficient first- and second-year supplies of nitrogen, but lack adequate nitrogen the following years.
this equipment also has a set of ripping shanks attached to the tractor that shatters deeper compaction before imprinting.
the potential for compaction is increased with these treatments and the tradeoffs of offsetting surface stability with long-term soil productivity should be weighed.
litter and duff can be applied manually to disturbed sites.
nurseries may inoculate plants; if this service is desired, it must be stated in the seedling-growing contract.
the amount of nitrogen that will be fixed on a site is related to the area of vegetative cover in nitrogen fixing host plants, the productivity of the plants, and factors such as temperature and moisture.
soils should not be too moist during ripping because the tines will slice through the soil, causing very little soil shatter.
erosion control revegetative mats (ecrm) or rolled erosion controlled products (recp) are applied directly to the soil surface for control of sheet erosion and to aid the establishment of vegetation.
during the summer, growth rates slow.
it also compared the growth of blue wild rye(elymus glaucus) and california fescue(festuca californica) (a and c).
long-fibered mulches, such as straw, wood strands, pine needles, and ground or chipped wood, placed at the appropriate thickness, usually meet these characteristics.
typically, those materials that protect the seeds from drying out but allow light and space for germinating seeds to grow into seedlings will perform the best for revegetation establishment.
this rate was subsequently reduced to 639 lb/ac to compensate for the volume of rock fragments and the shallow incorporation depth (3 inches instead of 7 inches).
if salvaged in this manner, small piles are created and soil is minimally handled.
during the assessment phase of the revegetation plan, a topsoil survey should be conducted to determine the depth and quality of the topsoil that will be excavated (see section 5.5.1).
the subsoiler grapple rake (figure 10.10) adds several design features to the excavator bucket.
the high c:n of the sawdust was believed to be a factor in inhibiting the establishment of weedy annuals.
this makes artificial inoculation even more critical.
a low cce material, such as slag, might have a cce of 60, which means that it has 40% less neutralizing capacity.
figure 10.1 gives an example of how a nitrogen threshold value was obtained by evaluating the total soil nitrogen levels from two disturbed reference sites, one considered "fair" revegetation and one considered "poor."
nevertheless, with surface-applied limestone, it should be assumed that soil ph will not change much deeper than 3 inches below the soil surface.
grass and forb plant communities are therefore more suited to these areas.
since heavy equipment is used, trackwalking can compact soils.
all liming materials will raise soil ph, but not at the same level as pure limestone.
the quantity of cubic yards of topsoil required per acre can be determined based on the depth of topsoil from figure 10.25.
the pine straw industry is well developed in this part of the country.
determining minimum topsoil application depths can be based on the minimum amount of nitrogen required to establish a self-maintaining plant community.
the material must be well-composted, or stable, which can be indirectly determined by a respirometry test or calculated using c:n obtained from laboratory testing of nitrogen and organic matter.
liming materials can be mixed on steep slopes using an excavator.
most post-construction sites are in poor condition for plant growth and will require the implementation of mitigating measures if full or even partial revegetation is expected.
rice straw, for instance, is wiry and does not readily shatter, which makes it more difficult to apply as compared to wheat, barley, or oats (kay 1983; jackson and others 1988).
these practices help ensure that plants will become established.
limestone materials are commonly applied in powder form through fertilizer spreaders or hydroseeding equipment.
topsoil layers are typically removed with either the blade of a tractor or excavator bucket.
this is not always possible, especially when topsoil storage space is limited.
pelletized limestone, which is very finely ground material that has been processed into shot-sized particles, is easy to handle and can be used in fertilizer spreaders.
for example, a project objective to increase permeability would require the addition of 6 inches of compost mixed into 24 inches of soil.
when an organic source with high c:n is incorporated into the soil, carbon becomes available as an energy source for decomposing soil organisms.
figure 10.7 — short-term benefits of ripping (using a winged subsoiler) and mulching road surfaces vary by soil type, as shown in rainfall simulation tests on sites in northern idaho.
fine-textured mulches, on the other hand, create a more favorable environment for seed germination because they hold more moisture and are in closer contact with seeds.
rice straw, for instance, is wiry and does not readily shatter, which makes it more difficult to apply as compared to wheat, barley, or oats (kay 1983; jackson and others 1988).
soil — topsoil, humus or duff from beneath ecm host plants can be used for inoculum if done properly.
for example, litter and duff collected from cool, moist sites should not be applied on hot, dry sites.
for instance, ammonium sulfate contains nitrogen and sulfur; triple superphosphate contains phosphorus, sulfur and calcium.
the arm of the excavator can reach 35 to 40 feet on steep cut and fill slopes and work soils that were previously inaccessible to most equipment.
after plant establishment, rates can be increased to account for increased plant utilization above this amount.
unless the seeds are extremely small, sowing seeds over installed erosion mats is not recommended because larger seeds will hang up in the fabric.
arid sites should have slower rates of release than sites with high moisture; cold sites should take longer to release nutrients than warm sites.
fresh, moist compost piles will usually generate heat in the first few days of composting, reaching 140 to 160 °f, which will kill most pathogens and weed seeds (epstein 1997; daugovish and others 2006).
not only does source-identified straw act as a mulch, but it also supplies extra native seeds to the site.
most projects limit topsoil piles to 3 to 6 ft in height.
litter from shrub plant communities provides less protection because the leaves are less interlocking.
sheet mulches are large pieces of non-permeable or slightly permeable materials made from translucent plastic, newspaper, or geotextiles (woven fabrics) that are anchored around planted seedlings (figure 10.16).
soil on restoration sites, however, may not contain the proper species of bacteria to form a symbiotic partnership with the plant.
perennial grasses and forbs do not require high levels of nitrogen for germination and early establishment (reeder and sabey 1987).
nitrogen-fixing nursery stock with nodulated root systems have exhibited faster early growth than seedlings that were not inoculated.
at the end of the assessment, calculate the number of seedlings per known volume or weight of litter material.
microcatchments include a storage basin and berm.
disadvantages are that some nutrients, such as nitrogen, will leach through the soil profile if they are not first taken up by plants or captured by soil microorganisms in the break down of carbon.
the example label for a 50 lb bag of fertilizer in figure 10.3 shows 21% nitrogen (n), which indicates that 10.5 lb of material in the bag is made up of nitrogen (50 * 21/100=10.5).
duff and litter can be collected from adjacent forest- or shrub-dominated sites or salvaged prior to construction.
this equates to 1.5 to 2 tons per acre, depending on the type of straw and its moisture content.
after emergence, some plants become naturally inoculated by airborne spores and grow much larger and healthier than those that lack the fungal symbiont (figure 10.32b).
using a slow-release fertilizer with 8% nitrogen, the amount of bulk fertilizer necessary to bring nitrogen levels to minimum targets is 9,613 lb/ac (769*100/8=9,613), which is an extremely high rate of fertilizer to apply.
lime materials are relatively insoluble and only change the ph of the soil around where they were placed.
converting percentage of nutrient in the lab sample to lb/ac of the nutrient requires multiplying % of nutrient, soil layer thickness, soil bulk density, and fine soil fraction together with a constant (line d).
where runoff strips are on gentle gradients, constructed wetlands may possibly be developed (figure 10.46).
if 40% of the nitrogen became available the first year, 60% would remain for the following years (line e).
visit the plots during the spring and count the number of seeds that are germinating.
to give some idea of decomposition rates, claassen and carey (2004) found that partially composted yard waste with a c:n of 18:1 took over a year for nitrogen to become available under aerobic incubation testing conditions.
sowing that is done before mulching can be accomplished through dryland sowing methods or through hydroseeding.
broadcast fertilizers will accumulate in the depressions of the surface.
back to top beneficial microorganisms are naturally occurring bacteria, fungi, and other microbes that play a crucial role in plant productivity and health.
it also compared the growth of blue wild rye(elymus glaucus) and california fescue(festuca californica) (a and c).
large undecomposed wood can significantly reduce soil water storage due to low water-holding capacity of the material.
there are many examples where, in the urgency of erosion control, straw or hay from unknown sources was applied, resulting in the introduction of weed species.
in natural ecosystems, the root systems of successful plants have several microbial partnerships that allow them to survive and grow even in harsh conditions (figure 10.31).
the potential for compaction is increased with these treatments and the tradeoffs of offsetting surface stability with long-term soil productivity should be weighed.
other fungal symbionts produce antibiotics that provide chemical protection.
mulching for seed covering is critical on sites that have: 1) high evapotranspiration rates during germination, 2) unstable soil surfaces, 3) susceptibility to freeze-thaw, and 4) high soil ph. it is less important on sites where soil surfaces do not dry out during seed germination or on projects where seeds have been covered by soil.
it is important, therefore, to keep mulch several inches away from the stem of planted seedlings.
pelletized limestone, which is very finely ground material that has been processed into shot-sized particles, is easy to handle and can be used in fertilizer spreaders.
the same factors that affect longevity (e.g., texture, c:n, depth) also determine the effectiveness of aggregate mulches in deterring seed germination of unwanted vegetation around the seedling.
taking the time to select the appropriate erosion mats, native species mix, and seed placement techniques is essential for assuring that revegetation is successful.
a study in alberta, canada, for instance, revealed that topsoil had very little respiration or organic decomposition after three years in a stockpile due to the influence of the cold, dry climate (visser, fujikawa, and others 1984).
the distance that straw or hay can be blown depends on the hay blowing equipment, wind conditions during application, straw characteristics, and whether the material is being applied upslope or downslope (cuts or fills).
the end product is stabilized to the point that it is beneficial to plant growth (alexander 2003a, 2003b).
more open forest stands on dry, less productive sites will have thinner layers of duff and litter (often less than an inch deep).
yet within native grasses, some species have better properties as mulches than others.
high moisture and warm temperatures are important for accelerating decomposition rates.
the resultant inoculum can then be incorporated into growing media or planting beds before seeds or cuttings are sown.
if commercial mulch sources are nearby, this can be an economically viable option.
this is one reason why trackwalking has been considered beneficial for erosion control and revegetation because it does create a somewhat better "short-term" growing environment and reduces surface erosion and sedimentation on a very poor site.
visiting with mulch company representatives and viewing the type of products they produce is a good way to determine the types of products you can expect to receive.
organic aggregates are often used in highly visible areas because they are more esthetic in appearance than sheet mulches.
the resulting material is a relatively stable, sanitized product that is very dark brown to black in color.
on southern exposures, heat will build up at the surface of, and directly above, the mulch, creating extremely high temperatures on warm summer days.
k2o is divided by 1.21 to obtain 1.6% k. fertilizers are selected based on whether they contain the nutrients that are deficient on the project site.
in the example described in figure 10.5, the first year release rate of nitrogen from the slow-release organic fertilizer was estimated at 40%.
laboratory for analysis using the ______ standardized test to determine the number of propagules.
note: the higher rates used for mulching seedlings are only used in close proximity to the plants.
since liming materials are relatively insoluble in water, surface applications of lime, without some degree of soil mixing, renders the lime ineffective for immediate correction of subsoil acidity.
a. b. figure 10.40 — the accumulation of nitrogen by n-fixating bacteria is directly related to the cover of nitrogen-fixing host plants on a site.
to account for this, all commercially available liming materials are rated against pure limestone for neutralizing effects.
expose some of the root system of a nodulating plant in the nursery or field (figure 10.41b).
for example, the incorporation of alfalfa hay (c:n =13:1) will decompose quickly, and the effects on soil structure might be short-lived.
smp buffer method — for much greater accuracy, lab testing facilities offer the smp buffer method for determining the lime requirement for a disturbed soil.
to reduce the negative effects associated with very large piles, topsoils should be salvaged dry and kept dry during storage.
since this highway is visible from the rogue river (a designated "wild and scenic" river in southwestern oregon) and is heavily traveled for recreational purposes, it was important that the gabion walls be visually screened using native plants.
forrhizobium, a brown, pink, or red color inside is usually a good indicator that the millions of bacteria in the nodule are actively fixing nitrogen.
wood chips applied at the same rates are less likely to form continuous routes for water drainage because of their shape.
a seal of testing assurance (sta) facility (inset 10.7) will have these reports available while others might not.

frankia partner with non-leguminous plants, such as casuarinas, alders, bitterbrush, and buffaloberry (figure 10.39 c&d), and over 200 different plant species, distributed over eight families.
inoculated plants may establish more quickly with less water, fertilizer, and weed control, thereby reducing installation costs.
it is a good practice to visit the location of the organic sources to determine whether there are undesirable or noxious weeds on or nearby the piles.
wood strands, like straw, form a stable cover with high porosity or loft, characteristics which are important for controlling soil moisture and temperature around the germinating seeds.
it is also important to consider that if cuts and fills are left less compacted, there will be deeper rills and gullies created if concentrated flows of water are directed onto these slopes.
topsoiling has been found to increase plant cover and biomass through an increase in nutrient availability, water-holding capacity, and microbial activity, including mycorrhizae (claassen and zasoski 1994).
using larger transport capacities is one way to significantly cut the time associated with refilling mulch bins.
applying seeds during the mulching operation is accomplished by placing seeds in a "seed metering bin" attached to most mulch-blowing equipment.
many roads are adjacent to streams, lakes, or residential areas which can be affected by runoff or leaching of inappropriately applied fertilizers.
over time, however, these nutrients will become available for plant uptake.
consider placing a plastic covering over the piles to keep moisture out during the winter because wet mulch is harder to apply through a mulch blower than drier mulch.
the primary reason to fertilize is to supply nutrients during periods when plants can take them up for growth.
bailey (2004) found that the application of 3 inches of topsoil over subsoil in eastern washington increased the presence of native species by a factor of four and increased vegetative ground cover the first and second year by 20%.
overall costs are much higher because of the added expenses of transporting these materials to the site.
the mushrooms under this spruce are the fruiting bodies of a beneficial fungus that has formed mycorrhizae on the roots (b).
if these species are present, materials should not be purchased.
on sites where vegetation is expected to take several years to establish (e.g., arid, high elevation sites), it is important to apply a mulch with a longevity of more than one year.
the lack of competing vegetation and the low surface evaporation resulting from the placement of 3 to 4 inches of coarse sawdust resulted in very high soil moisture.
depending on the temperature and rainfall patterns of a site, this could influence seedling establishment.
duff is the dark, decomposed layer directly below the litter layer (leaves and needles are not identifiable in the duff layer) that is high in nutrients and humus.
seedlings can be planted on, or immediately above, berms or obstacles to access captured water.
surface roughening also reduces the potential for fertilizers to move off-slope through erosion.

amf inoculums typically come in a granular form with different grades of fineness.
because of the potential for weed invasion, potential offsite topsoil storage areas should have a weed assessment conducted prior to selection of the site.
liming low ph soils improves plant growth by 1) reducing aluminum toxicity, 2) increasing phosphorus and micronutrient availability, 3) favoring symbiotic and non-symbiotic nitrogen fixation, 4) improving soil structure, and 5) enhancing nitrification (havlin and others 1999).
to reduce the likelihood of seedling damage, follow these practices: when slow-release fertilizers are spread around well-established seedlings (several years after planting), seedlings often respond favorably, especially on highly disturbed sites.
if applied at high enough rates, long fibers can overlap, creating continuous pores that will increase drainage rates.
it is possible to make your own inoculum from spores.
composted organic materials are used for these purposes and are characterized by having low c:n, high nutrient levels, fine textures, and dark colors.
figure 10.45 — fill slope microcatchments take advantage of the low infiltration rates of compacted fill slopes (a) by capturing the runoff from road drainage at the bottom of the fill into topsoil or amended subsoil favorable for plant growth (b).
since fast-release fertilizers are salts, they have a potential to burn foliage and roots, especially when fertilizers are applied at high concentrations or when applied during dry weather (seesection 5.5.5.2).
yet within native grasses, some species have better properties as mulches than others.
short-fibered mulches are effective as an erosion control cover, but are considered inferior to long-fibered mulches for germination and early seedling establishment (kill and foote 1971; meyer and others 1971; kay 1974, 1978, 1983; racey and raitanen 1983;

because only partial decomposition has occurred, c:n is lower than fresh organic matter.
ecm fungi are generally specific to one genus or group of plants whereas the same amf fungus can colonize a wide variety of species.
fresh, moist compost piles will usually generate heat in the first few days of composting, reaching 140 to 160 °f, which will kill most pathogens and weed seeds (epstein 1997; daugovish and others 2006).
tablets and packets are put in the hole during planting.
a study in alberta, canada, for instance, revealed that topsoil had very little respiration or organic decomposition after three years in a stockpile due to the influence of the cold, dry climate (visser, fujikawa, and others 1984).
on harsher sites, 3 by 3 ft or even 4 by 4 ft sheets are necessary to control competing vegetation.

more accurate lab results obtained from the smp buffer method for determining lime requirements can be substituted for values obtained in this graph.
inoculation effectiveness has been shown to vary considerably between different products (figure 10.37c), so it is wise to install tests before purchasing large quantities of a specific product.
multiplying these percentages by the pounds of bulk fertilizer applied per acre will give the quantity of each nutrient applied per acre.
about 50-100 nodules blended in a liter of water is enough to inoculate about 500 seedlings.
these wings are angled upwards so the soil between the tines has greater lift, and therefore greater shatter when the soil drops behind the wing.
these measures will stabilize the straw by burying portions of the stems into the soil and can increase erosion protection because of the more intimate contact of straw with the soil surface.
a soil fertility strategy should also consider the application of topsoil, mulch, compost, wood waste, biosolids, and/or the planting of nitrogen-fixing species.
soils high in clays with high soil moisture have shallower critical depths (andrus and froehlich 1983).
cultured inoculant is purchased from commercial suppliers, seed banks, or sometimes, universities.

high c:n materials, such as uncomposted, shredded wood, bark, or sawdust, will last longer than low c:n materials, such as composted yard materials, because these materials are in the initial stages of the decomposition cycle.
commercially available organic fertilizers, such as fertil-fibert and biosol®, have been processed to remove most moisture, which makes them easier to apply through most fertilizer spreading equipment.
hydroseeding equipment, however, is probably the best method for spreading liming materials, especially very fine liming materials.
as discussed insection 10.1.1, fertilizers, the delayed timing of fertilization reduces the risk of nutrient leaching and increases the probability that nutrients will be available at the levels needed for established plants.
a rule of thumb is that some surface soil (15% to 20%) should be visible through the straw after application (kay 1972, 1983; jackson and others 1988).
if possible, work with a specialist to help with the following: selecting appropriate mycorrhizal partners for the species and outplanting sites; determining the best sources of inoculant and evaluating their effectiveness in the field conditions; and designing outplanting trials to evaluate seedling survival and mycorrhizal performance in the field, and modifying the inoculant sources if improvements are needed.

rock fragments have little or no cec, since they are massive in structure.
the trial shown in this picture compared straw mat (a and b) with a polywoven mat (c and d).
figure 10.21 — small field trials can help select the most appropriate species and materials for a project.
when the ph of the subsoil is significantly lower than the topsoil, liming to raise soil ph to reference topsoil levels (target levels) should be considered.
the quality of the litter for erosion control and longevity varies by the dominant forest or shrub species.
pure culture inoculum — mycorrhizal fungi are available commercially as pure cultures, usually in a peat-based carrier (figure 10.34).
mycorrhizal fungi extend the plant's root system, and extract nutrients and water from the soil.
in addition to providing soil protection and nutrients, litter and duff can also contain dormant, yet viable, seeds from species that make up the forest or shrub plant communities.
in this photograph, seedlings were planted in clumps to mimic the small islands of trees that grew in this geographic area.
on projects where topsoil has been salvaged and reapplied, subsoilers or rippers are the preferred equipment.
live propagules per seedling.
each nodule contains millions of the bacteria that accumulate atmospheric nitrogen and share this nitrogen with the plant.
the smp test is well adapted for soils with ph values below 5.8 and containing less than 10% organic matter (mclean 1973).
the results from this test are reported in a table that includes the quantity of lime needed to raise the soil sample to ph 7.
verifying the effectiveness of ecm inoculation — luckily, it is fairly easy to recognize ecm as the fungi can be seen with the naked eye on the root system.
coarser textured products (figure 10.37a) are meant for incorporation into soil or growing media, and finer-textured products (figure 10.37b) are applied as wettable powders through sprayers or injected into irrigation systems.
fertilizer rates are determined for each deficient nutrient as shown in figure 10.5.
faster growth early can also lead to faster canopy closure, which shades the soil and reduces weed establishment and growth.
organic aggregate mulch — organic aggregates are another group of materials that, when placed thickly around installed plants, will control the establishment of competing vegetation and reduce surface evaporation (figure 10.17).
the fertilizer label will give an indication of how quickly nutrients are released.
these are an expensive form of fertilizer and have not been tested on roadside revegetation conditions.
controlled release fertilizers are preferred because they release small doses of nutrients gradually, compared to the more rapid nutrient release from traditional products.
native hay from seed production fields — one of the byproducts of native grass seed production is the stubble that remains in the fields after seed harvest.
the rating system is called calcium carbonate equivalents (cce).
for example, for sites with annual rainfalls of 12 inches, nitrate could move to a depth of four feet if it was not taken up by plants or soil organisms.
they are composed of such materials as polypropylene, straw, coconut, hay, wood excelsior, and jute.
the distance that straw or hay can be blown depends on the hay blowing equipment, wind conditions during application, straw characteristics, and whether the material is being applied upslope or downslope (cuts or fills).
for this reason, it is important to understand the objectives for mulching and to integrate them into a comprehensive strategy when selecting mulch types and application methods.
this product raises ph faster, and depending on the soil type, can move a short distance into the soil surface.
under dry conditions, there is less potential to compact the soil or destroy soil aggregation.
even on small machines, up to 5 tines can be added to increase soil shatter.
the benefits of this practice are erosion control and maintenance of mycorrhizae inoculum through the presence of live roots.
finer lime materials are more expensive to purchase.
endomycorrhizal species, on the other hand, are broad in range and therefore a general mix of several endomycorrhizal species can be utilized for a broader range of plants.
figuring out which products will serve your project needs at the right price can be challenging.
therefore, on slopes that have been tilled, it is important to redirect any concentrated flow of water that might enter the top of the cut to areas that are designed to handle this water.
more accurate lab results obtained from the smp buffer method for determining lime requirements can be substituted for values obtained in this graph.
very fine materials change ph quicker than coarse materials.
the operation shown in this photograph shows the wood waste material being dropped into a grinder with an excavator (left), and conveyed as mulch to the bucket of a front end loader (right).
healthy, sustainable plant communities are our ultimate goal in roadside revegetation; inoculation can help accelerate the process.
application rates and methods for ectomycorrhizal inoculums will vary by species.
a specific amf is acquired either commercially or from a field site as a starter culture, and then added to a sterile potting medium.
these results led to using california fescue and polywoven erosion mat for the project described in inset 10.3.
identifying the type of waste reduction equipment can narrow the type of mulch produced (table 10.5).
as a rule, the deeper topsoil is applied, the higher the site productivity will be.
water harvesting can result when local topography is modified to capture runoff water and concentrate it in areas where it can be used by plants (see section 5.2) (for background on water harvesting, see fidelibus and bainbridge 2006).the integration of these three components will determine the success of a topographic enhancement design.
the seeds are detached from the stem as it is blown through the equipment, falling to the surface of the soil and covered by the grass stems.
when this is the case, topsoil is trucked offsite to larger storage piles.
constructed wetlands can create favorable habitat for unique flora and fauna.
any extra fertilizer has the potential of being wasted.
a. b. c. figure 10.33 — soil inoculum can be collected from adjacent plants if done carefully (a).
as the bander is pulled through the soil, a line, or band, of fertilizer is created.
rocky soils will require less lime materials to raise ph. depth of liming material.
the rate of limestone for the surface soil was subtracted from the target rate to give the quantity of limestone to add to 7 inches of soil (the depth of incorporation upon which these graphs were based).
at the construction site, seeded mats were attached to the wire mesh at the face of the wall (c) and compost-amended soil was placed behind the screen and lightly tamped.
ecm fungi are generally specific to one genus or group of plants whereas the same amf fungus can colonize a wide variety of species.
tillage alone will not return a soil to its original bulk density or hydrologic function (figure 10.7), nor will the effects of tillage last indefinitely, especially in non-cohesive soils (onstad and others 1984).
since this highway is visible from the rogue river (a designated "wild and scenic" river in southwestern oregon) and is heavily traveled for recreational purposes, it was important that the gabion walls be visually screened using native plants.
the chart is based on measuring ph changes of four soil textural classes as limestone is incorporated into the surface 7 inches of soil (chart modified from havlin and others 1999).
applications of certain herbicides, pesticides, insecticides, fungicides, and nematicides are detrimental to mycorrhizal fungi.
application of endomycorrhizal inoculum to soil surface endomycorrhizal inoculum will be applied at a rate of __________________
while the performance of this new product as a seed cover has not been tested, it has all the characteristics of being an excellent seed cover.
studies have shown that placing fertilizers or liming materials in the planting hole or on the soil surface around seedlings at the time of planting can significantly decrease seedling survival, especially on droughty sites (nursery technical cooperative 2004; jacobs and others 2004; walker 2002).
if commercial mulch sources are nearby, this can be an economically viable option.
organic aggregate mulches consist of shredded or chipped wood derived from bark, wood, branches, sawdust, or lawn clippings applied deeply around seedlings.
without these bacterial partnerships, plants are not able to make direct use of atmospheric nitrogen.
the rating system is called calcium carbonate equivalents (cce).
for example, a project objective to increase permeability would require the addition of 6 inches of compost mixed into 24 inches of soil.
seesection 10.1.3.11 for more information on litter and duff.
this equipment meters seeds into the mulch as it is being applied.
hydroseeders and broadcast fertilizer spreaders, as discussed above, are means of applying the fertilizer evenly over the site, then the fertilizer is tilled into the soil using equipment outlined insection 10.1.2, tillage.
straw and hay are often used on revegetation projects because they are available, comparatively inexpensive, and generally successful in establishing grass and forb plants from seeds.
restricting topsoil excavation operations to dry periods should be considered for large topsoil piles or if topsoil will remain in piles for greater than one year.
there is usually a readily-available source of wood material from project sites situated in forested environments.
two species of nitrogen-fixing bacteria that are important in revegetation arerhizobium and frankia.
to reduce the negative effects associated with very large piles, topsoils should be salvaged dry and kept dry during storage.
as the carbon sources become depleted, the high populations of soil microorganisms die and nitrogen is released for plant growth.
the seed bales are applied to the site through hay blowing equipment.
in addition to providing soil protection and nutrients, litter and duff can also contain dormant, yet viable, seeds from species that make up the forest or shrub plant communities.
if the loam borrow comes from subsoils or parent material, it should be assumed that beneficial soil microorganisms are not present and should be added when the soil is manufactured.
some organic sources have been stored in piles for long periods of time and are partially decomposed.
during this critical period, desirable mulches will: figure 10.13 — long-fibered mulches, like wood strands shown below, create a good growing environment because seeds and seedlings are protected from excessive drying during germination and early seedling establishment.
mulch storage — if wood fiber is stored for long periods of time, the materials should not be placed in piles taller than 10 ft.
unlike pathogenic fungi, mycorrhizae will never show signs of root decay and the mycelia around the root will be visible.
reapplying them to disturbed sites completes several operations at once: 1) adds seeds, 2) covers seeds, and 3) adds a supply of long-term nutrients.
microbial biomass levels and mycorrhizal fungi have been found to be very low in the bottom of large stockpiles (ross and cairns 1981; miller and jastrow 1992).
if disturbance will take place, then other interventions will be necessary to introduce the key microsymbionts for the plants you are trying to establish.
mulch is placed around newly planted or established plants to improve survival and growing conditions by: studies have shown that survival and growth of young trees are significantly increased by applying mulches around seedlings at the time of planting (debyle 1969;
controlled release fertilizers are preferred because they release small doses of nutrients gradually, compared to the more rapid nutrient release from traditional products.
turf reinforcement mats (trm) are materials that are filled with soil when installed to increase surface soil strength (kemp 2006).
when applied correctly, the strands of long-fibered mulch loosely bridge on top of each other, much like "pick-up-sticks," forming large air spaces or pores (figure 10.13).
a conductivity meter can be used to measure the conductivity of the solution (seesection 5.5.5).
application — straw and hay can be spread by hand or with a straw blower.
figure 10.2 shows an example of how nitrogen deficits are calculated based on post-construction soil tests and established threshold levels.
rhizobium grow with some members of the legume family (figure 10.39 a&b), and plants of the elm family.
in this operation, tracked equipment are "walked" up and down cut and fill slopes, leaving a pattern of tractor cleat imprints on the soil surface no deeper than an inch or two deep.
coarse-textured mulches are excellent mulches because they hold very little moisture at the mulch surface, and are therefore poor environments for seed germination of unwanted vegetation.
the variety of available organic sources, unique soil types, and range of climates of the western united states make this difficult.
a low cce material, such as slag, might have a cce of 60, which means that it has 40% less neutralizing capacity.
for these species, the seeds are not harvested, but baled together with the grass stems.
to account for this, all commercially available liming materials are rated against pure limestone for neutralizing effects.
applications of certain herbicides, pesticides, insecticides, fungicides, and nematicides are detrimental to mycorrhizal fungi.
d. slow-release fertilizers (dotted line) release nutrients at a much slower rate.
the seeds that are contained in the straw may not always be considered inappropriate for use in revegetation projects.
early establishment of nitrogen-fixing plants accelerates natural nutrient cycling on the project sites and promotes the establishment of sustainable plant communities.
these guides also cover how to increase gathered wild collections at nurseries to ensure that the revegetation project has sufficient quantities of plant materials.
studies have shown that stored topsoil can remain viable from 6 months (claassen and zasoski 1994) to several years (miller and may 1979; visser, fujikawa, and others 1984; visser, griffiths, and others 1984,) but will decrease in viability after 5 years (miller and may 1979;
large piles should be stored for as short a time as possible.
liming low ph soils improves plant growth by 1) reducing aluminum toxicity, 2) increasing phosphorus and micronutrient availability, 3) favoring symbiotic and non-symbiotic nitrogen fixation, 4) improving soil structure, and 5) enhancing nitrification (havlin and others 1999).
mulches therefore have many functions or roles in the recovery of native vegetation to a disturbed site.
figure 10.14 — hydromulch with tackifier can stabilize the soil surface for up to a year, but does not necessarily create an optimum environment for germinating seeds.
the first year results indicated that there was much better establishment of grasses on the polywoven erosion mat than the straw mat, yet no difference in species growth.
while plants that form this association are sometimes called "nitrogen-fixing plants", the plant itself is not able to fix nitrogen from the air.
materials with greatest longevity are most long-fibered wood mulches, as well as erosion mats made from polypropylene.
the drawbacks to erosion mats are generally not in the product itself, but in how it gets applied to the site.
for example, a 10-inch depth of topsoil would require 1,350 yd3 of topsoil.
these layers are sources of decomposed and partially decomposed organic matter.
because this type of inoculum is made from pure fungal cultures and does not store well, it is rarely available from suppliers.
this would require 4 inches of organic matter be incorporated for every 9 inches of soil.
small seeds can be applied over erosion mats if tackifiers are not used and if the timing is correct so sufficient rain will move it through the erosion mat to the soil surface.
taking the time to select the appropriate erosion mats, native species mix, and seed placement techniques is essential for assuring that revegetation is successful.
frankia partner with non-leguminous plants, such as casuarinas, alders, bitterbrush, and buffaloberry (figure 10.39 c&d), and over 200 different plant species, distributed over eight families.
for example, if nitrogen, phosphorus, and boron are deficient, only fertilizers that contain these nutrients need be considered.
since nutrients have varying degrees of mobility (nitrogen is highly mobile; phosphorus and many micronutrients are relatively immobile), how fertilizers are applied will determine how accessible nutrients are to the root system.
in figure 10.48, compost is mixed to a depth of 3 feet by an excavator in irregular shaped planting islands.
in addition, application of fast-release fertilizers at this time can potentially pollute water sources.
it is important for the revegetation specialist to learn how to develop fertilizer prescriptions that integrate short- and long-term site fertility goals with water quality objectives.
collect ripe fruiting bodies of mushrooms (figure 10.33b), puffballs, or truffles (figure 10.33c) from beneath healthy plants.
where topsoil quantities are limiting, it is important to develop a strategy that addresses the location the topsoil will be spread and the depth at which it will be applied.
again, there is little research on amf inoculation effectiveness on roadside revegetation sites.
these are suggested settings and should not be applied without first monitoring the results of the equipment on the project soils.
figure 10.30 — this chart can be used to approximate the liming application rates for disturbed soils.
these results led to using california fescue and polywoven erosion mat for the project described in inset 10.3.
the effectiveness of sheet mulches increases with the size of the sheets.
mulch is pneumatically delivered to the site through an application hose which can reach several hundred feet up steep slopes (a) with still enough force for ample delivery of mulch (b).
this often leads to applying topsoil too thinly across a project site.
this equipment fractured over 80% of the compaction in several operational tests, as compared to 18% to 43% for rock rippers and 38% for brush rakes.
figure 10.19 — large mulching operations require access and working space.
mulch thicknesses of 3 inches have been found to reduce soil temperatures below mulch layers by 8 to 10 °f (slick and curtis 1985; steinfeld 2004), which can benefit the growth of seedlings on very hot sites.
decomposition of organic matter in stored topsoil will reduce microbial biomass essential for nitrogen cycling (ross and cairns 1981) and fine roots that store mycorrhizal inoculum (miller and may 1979; miller and jastrow 1992).
because amf spores are so small and fragile, they are mixed with a carrier such as vermiculite or calcined clay to aid in application.
straw is often preferred over hay because it generally contains fewer undesirable seeds.
these fungi have wide host ranges and are found on most wild and cultivated grasses and annual crops, most tropical plants, and some temperate tree species including cedars, alders, and maples.
table 10.10 — liming materials are rated by how well they neutralize the soil using pure limestone as the baseline of 100%.
inoculated plants may establish more quickly with less water, fertilizer, and weed control, thereby reducing installation costs.
planting pockets must have adequate soil depth to store intercepted water and support establishment of planted seedlings.
threshold values can be determined by comparing soil tests from several disturbed and undisturbed reference sites (seechapter 4).
be clear what "weed free" means when you purchase these materials.
figure 10.42 — after successful inoculation, nitrogen-fixing bacteria will multiply on the root system as plants grow.
a. b. figure 10.35 — ectomycorrhizae are visible on plant root systems as white or colored structures with a cottony or felt-like texture.
this would require 4 inches of organic matter be incorporated for every 9 inches of soil.
if weeds are observed during the field survey, it should be assumed that the seeds of these species are present in the topsoil and these areas should be avoided.
the composition, or makeup, of the fertilizer is called the fertilizer analysis.
these are optimum rates because they do not account for the time it takes to travel to the mulch source, load the mulch bin, and travel back to the application site.
soil texture plays an important role in lime requirements because the higher the clay content, the more lime must be added to the soil.
disturbed reference sites should range from poor success to good.
under topsoil storage conditions, this material will undergo some decomposition, releasing nutrients.
slow- and fast-release fertilizers can be combined to provide short- and long-term nutrient requirements (figure 10.6 e and f).
microbial biomass levels and mycorrhizal fungi have been found to be very low in the bottom of large stockpiles (ross and cairns 1981; miller and jastrow 1992).
applying seeds during the mulching operation is accomplished by placing seeds in a "seed metering bin" attached to most mulch-blowing equipment.
for large jobs, using a straw blower is the most practical application method.
in some cases, fertilizer applications can be reduced by half or more due to the increased nutrient uptake by mycorrhizal fungi.
for example, a 10-inch depth of topsoil would require 1,350 yd3 of topsoil.
the seeded bales are applied directly to the site through straw blowing equipment, accomplishing seeding and mulching in one operation (figures 10.22 and 10.23).
the resulting material is a relatively stable, sanitized product that is very dark brown to black in color.
the depth of topsoil application is generally based on the amount of topsoil available and the desired productivity of the site after application.
most fresh and aged organic sources have c:n greater than 15:1 (table 10.8) and will immobilize nitrogen for some period of time when incorporated into the soil.
establish test plots at sites that are representative of each revegetation unit (these can be reference sites).
coarse grade products (figure 10.37a) are mixed in the soil prior to sowing seed.
soil compaction and removal of topsoil which is routine during road construction is particularly detrimental to beneficial soil microorganisms.
to increase the rate of decomposition, the piles should be moved several times a year to add oxygen.
design criteria for determining the distance between terraces include slope gradient, rainfall intensities, and infiltration rates.
if nitrogen is applied, ammonium-n is better used by the plant than nitrate-n (landis 1989).
lime material composition.
wood strands are delivered in different size bales and applied by hand or through straw blowing equipment (figure 10.23).
slow-release fertilizers come in either organic or inorganic forms.
also, beneficial bacteria and fungi do not survive in soil in the absence of their host plants and so are killed during soil removal and stockpiling.
the drawbacks to erosion mats are generally not in the product itself, but in how it gets applied to the site.
the rate at which the metering system delivers seeds can be adjusted and must be calibrated prior to mulching to obtain the desired seed density (seesection 10.3.1, seeding, for seed calibration methods).
the percentage of p in the bag in figure 10.3 is actually 2.2%, not 5% (5.0%/2.29=2.2).
seed growers identify straw bales by genetic source, so it is important to be sure that the source-identified bales are appropriate for the geographic area of the project site.
these coatings include sulfur (e.g., sulfur-coated urea) and polymers.
purchasing straw and hay — the drawbacks to using straw and hay are that these materials can contain seeds from undesirable species, are susceptible to wind movement, have limited application distance, and decompose in a relatively short time compared to other mulches.
under dry conditions, there is less potential to compact the soil or destroy soil aggregation.
coarser-textured products (a) can be incorporated into soil or growing media, whereas finer-textured products can be sprayed like a wettable powder (b).
a total soil nitrogen (n) 0.025 % from soil test of post construction soils — gr/l, ppm, mg/kg, ug/g divide by 10,000 for % b thickness of soil layer 0.5 feet the thickness of soil represented in (a) c soil bulk density 1.4 gr/cc unless known, use 1.5 for compacted subsoils, 1.3 for undisturbed soils, 0.9 for light soils such as pumice d fine soil fraction 70 % 100% minus the rock fragment content — from estimates made from sieved soil prior to sending to lab e n in soil layer:
operating equipment on the contour (cross slope) is limited to gentler slopes (table 10.4).
application rates depend on factors such as length and diameter of hose, blowing equipment, elevation rise, and dimension of the area being covered.
selecting the appropriate organic matter, soil texture, and soil amendments for manufactured topsoil will increase the success of the project.
this was a guess based on the manufacturer's estimates of 55% release, but because it was being applied to a semi-arid site where decomposition of the fertilizer would be slow, the rate was dropped to 40% (line d in 10.5).
compost must be free of weed seeds and vegetative material that propagate weedy plants (e.g., blackberry canes).
these materials will then provide a source of nitrogen to the soil.
subsoilers and rippers are best used for projects that consist of gentle terrain or obliterated road sections.
collection of needles and duff should be done during the summer and fall, when the litter and duff are completely dry.
for these species, the seeds are not harvested, but baled together with the grass stems.
the critical depth changes for soil type and tine configuration.
this example illustrates the difficulty in developing fertilizer prescriptions to meet long-term nutrient targets.
not only do microorganisms compete with plants for nitrogen, they store it in their cell walls, making it unavailable for plant growth for long periods of time.
these may not be with optimal or highly productive bacterial partners, and it may take months or even years on highly disturbed sites.
if these species are present, materials should not be purchased.
amf inoculums typically come in a granular form with different grades of fineness.
mulching is also less critical on sites that have low evapotranspiration rates or high summer rainfall.
for 500 seedlings, about 5 liters of water is used.
back to top mulch is defined as a protective material placed on the soil surface to prevent evaporation, moderate surface temperatures, prevent weed establishment, enrich the soil, and reduce erosion.
practices include protecting seedlings from animal browsing, installing shade cards, irrigating, and installing tree shelters.
however, it should be noted that these rates were developed for 70 °f soil temperatures (rose 2002), which are higher than soil temperatures in the western united states during the spring and fall when roots and foliage are growing.
nitrogen-fixing bacteria form nodules on roots of certain plants (figure 10.38a) and accumulate nitrogen from the air (figure 10.38b).
nevertheless, these materials should not be overlooked because they can be a source for seeds and nutrients.
as soil gradually moves into the depressions over time (through water erosion or surface ravel), the broadcast fertilizers will become covered with soil.
because they contain living cultures of bacteria, these inoculants are perishable and should be kept in cool, dark conditions, such as inside a refrigerator.
tilling is often done to roughen the soil surface for erosion control and to create a more optimum seedbed (seesection 5.6.7).
appropriate beneficial microorganism can be reintroduced by "inoculating" seeds as they are sown in the field or in the nursery, or by introducing the microorganism in the planting hole.
imprinting methods that are tractor-based are restricted by slope gradients.
the bag also contains 0.02 % boron (b), which indicates that there is 0.01 lb boron in the bag.
the species affected byfrankia are called "actinorhizal" plants (table 10.11).
how they actually release on-site will vary from site to site, depending on temperature, moisture, and whether the fertilizer was placed on the surface or incorporated into the soil.
the storage basin, created by terraces or berms, can be improved for plant growth with soil tillage and incorporation of soil amendments.
unless species that propagate vegetatively are used in these structures (seesection 10.2.2), care must be taken to avoid planting where sediment will bury the seedling.
when these same materials are composted, c:n approaches or even falls below 15:1.
slow-release fertilizers are more appropriate for seed sowing in the fall because much of the fertilizer should last through the winter, releasing nutrients in the spring (figure 10.6d).
warm temperatures and high moisture, conditions conducive to plant growth, are also favorable for the break down of organic fertilizers.
when these same materials are composted, c:n approaches or even falls below 15:1.
fertilizer type and form is also important.
the resulting heat generated in the process sanitizes the material.
because amf spores are so small and fragile, they are mixed with a carrier such as vermiculite or calcined clay to aid in application.
endomycorrhizal species, on the other hand, are broad in range and therefore a general mix of several endomycorrhizal species can be utilized for a broader range of plants.
tables 10.1 and 10.2 give analysis values for many common fertilizers.
scarification is the shallow loosening of the soil surface using brush blades, harrows, chains, disks, and chisels.
they are formed from soil or woody debris (logs), or manufactured products such as straw waddles (figure 10.45) or compost berms.
seed growers identify straw bales by genetic source, so it is important to be sure that the source-identified bales are appropriate for the geographic area of the project site.
this practice has some risks, because fertilizers release salts which can damage roots.
it is a good practice to visit the location of the organic sources to determine whether there are undesirable or noxious weeds on or nearby the piles.
when two or more tines are placed together on a toolbar, they work in tandem to more effectively break up compaction.
a minimum depth that has been shown to control evaporation is one inch (slick and curtis 1985).
first, the surface of the soil must be smoothed to a uniform elevation before the mat is placed.
the longevity of an organic aggregate mulch also depends on the application thickness — the thicker the layer of mulch, the longer it will last.
fast-release fertilizers — fast-release fertilizers are highly soluble fertilizer salts that dissolve rapidly and move quickly into the soil during rainstorms or snowmelt.
figure 10.47 — most planting islands are designed to mimic the natural surrounding environment of the project site.
observing erosional patterns on unvegetated road cuts near the project site can give an indication of approximate spacing for benches (see section 5.6.8).
figure 10.12 shows a makeshift imprinter, which is simply 4 strips of angle iron welded to a bucket to create a pattern of 3-inch deep impressions.
this equipment is tractor-drawn and limited to gentle slope gradients (5h:1v or greater) and soils low in rock fragments.
hose lengths can be attached to extend the delivery of mulch up to 400 ft.
