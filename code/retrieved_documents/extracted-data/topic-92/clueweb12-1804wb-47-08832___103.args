it is built with fossil fuels from mining and fabrication to delivery.
the average cost of a natural gas pipeline is one million dollars per mile, and we have 200,000 miles of natural gas pipeline, which we can’t re-use because they are composed of metal that would become brittle and leak, as well as the incorrect diameter to maximize hydrogen throughput.
after 620 miles, 8 percent of the hydrogen has been used to move it through the pipeline.31 conclusion at some point along the chain of making, putting energy in, storing, and delivering the hydrogen, we will have used more energy than we can get back, and this doesn’t count the energy used to make fuel cells, storage tanks, delivery systems, and vehicles.32 when fusion can make cheap hydrogen, when reliable long-lasting nanotube fuel cells exist, and when light-weight leak-proof carbon-fiber polymer-lined storage tanks and pipelines can be made inexpensively, then we can consider building the hydrogen economy infrastructure.

the problem is, it’s very hard to distribute the heat into the gas hydrate layer.
in fact, fossil fuel depletion may not be the tipping point of ecological disaster – the burning of it has changed the chemistry of the atmosphere and oceans, which could bring on sudden climate change and extreme weather: another ice age, droughts and floods, powerful hurricanes and storms – perhaps even another permian-level extinction, with 90% of species vanishing (including us).

offshore windmills are a hazard to navigation of freighters and other ships.
although a 6,000 dry ton per day biorefinery would have 33% lower costs than a 2,000 ton factory, the price of gas and diesel limits the distance the biofuel refinery can be from farms, since the bales are large in volume but low in density, which limits how many bales can be loaded onto a truck and transported economically.
hay is a dangerous commodity — it can spontaneously combust, and once on fire, can’t be extinguished, leading to fire loss and increased fire insurance costs.

this can happen at a microscopic level which is only detected when a pipe bursts.
wind blows the strongest when customer demand is the weakest in denmark, where some of the world’s largest wind farms exist, wind blows the hardest when consumer demand is the lowest, so denmark ends up selling its extra electricity to other countries for pennies, and then when demand is up, buys electricity back at much higher prices.
