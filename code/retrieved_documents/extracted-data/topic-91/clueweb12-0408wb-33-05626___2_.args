the results of our experiments show that the proposed approach has a comparable performance to that of random forests, with the added advantage of being applicable to any base-level algorithm without the need to randomize the latter.they derive their strength from two aspects: using random subsamples of the training data (as in bagging) and randomizing the algorithm for learning base-level classifiers (decision trees).7th international symposium on intelligent data analysis, ljubljana 2007 7th international symposium on intelligent data analysis, ljubljana 2007 combining bagging and random subspaces to create better ensembles author: panče panov, jožef stefan institute published: oct. 8, 2007,  recorded: september 2007,   views: 305 categories top » computer science » machine learning » ensemble methods turn off the lights you might be experiencing some problems with your video player.log in | register | new user register sign in location: academic organisations » jožef stefan institute » 7th international symposium on intelligent data analysis, ljubljana 2007 - home - browse lectures - people - conferences - academic organisations - eu supported - about us - blog 7th international symposium on intelligent data analysis, ljubljana 2007 combining bagging and random subspaces to create better ensembles author: panče panov, jožef stefan institute published: oct. 8, 2007, recorded: september 2007, views: 305 categories - top » computer science » machine learning » ensemble methods turn off the lights you might be experiencing some problems with your video player.if you have found a problem with this lecture or would like to send us extra material, articles, exercises, etc., please use ourticket system to describe your request and upload the data.summary 13:25 further work related content report a problem or upload files if you have found a problem with this lecture or would like to send us extra material, articles, exercises, etc., please use ourticket system to describe your request and upload the data.enter your e-mail into the 'cc' field, and we will keep you updated with your request's status.
