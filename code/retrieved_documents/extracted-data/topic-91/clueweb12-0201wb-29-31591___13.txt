crfs outperform both memms and hmms on a number of real-world tasks in many fields, including bioinformatics, computational linguistics and speech recognition.
the primary advantage  of crfs over hidden markov models is their conditional nature, resulting in the  relaxation of the independence assumptions required by hmms in order to ensure  tractable inference.
in spite of this additional power, exact learning and inference algorithms for  semi-crfs are polynomial-time—often only a small constant factor slower  than conventional crfs.
therefore they have to make simplifying, often unrealistic assumptions on the  conditional independence of observations given the motion class labels and  cannot accommodate overlapping features or long term contextual dependencies in  the observation sequence.
