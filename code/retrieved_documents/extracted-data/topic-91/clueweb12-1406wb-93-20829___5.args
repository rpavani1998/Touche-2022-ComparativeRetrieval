those entites in the training data which the model was unable to capture (i.e., the model mis-classifies those entites) have their weights boosted.

the result is then a panel of models used to make a decision on new data by combining the ``expertise'' of each model in such a way that the more accurate experts carry more weight.
a weak learning algorithm is one that is only somewhat better than random guessing in terms of error rates (i.e., the error rate is just below 50%).

this model building followed by boosting is repeated until the specific generated model performs no better than random.
an example might be decision trees of depth 1 (i.e., decision stumps).
