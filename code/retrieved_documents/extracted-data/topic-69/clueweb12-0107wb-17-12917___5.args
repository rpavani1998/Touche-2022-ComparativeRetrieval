my ali-frazier fight didn't turn out as i had hoped.
and if all those press releases from ea were even half-true, thenkk2000 could pull it off.
it looked like something out ofsoul calibur (complete with a colored inertia trail) and had me scratching my head as to why it would be in a boxing sim.
that was probably the most fun i had playing this game, but it was short-lived because of all the flaws i mentioned above and the fact that all create-a-player features get old.
i anxiously rushed frazier and proceeded with a flurry of rights and lefts that were sure, i thought, to do damage and leave him stunned.
and again, the result was not what i expected because half my punches (as lethal as they were) completely missed their target, even at point blank range.
i won the fight, but it was a hollow victory.
but what actually happened was that after a vicious right hook, frazier came back immediately with a right hook of his own.
as the game intro winds down we see in-game footage of ali pulverizing an unidentified boxer.
arcade boxing fans should get a dreamcast (if you don't already have one) and get ready 2 rumble.
i didn't think much of it then so i just backed off and decided to try out the signature moves mapped onto the four c-buttons.
to its credit, black ops has created some excellent-looking 3d representations of boxing's greats but i wasted little time in choosing muhammad ali with joe frazier as my opponent and caesar's palace as the battleground.
as the game intro winds down we see in-game footage of ali pulverizing an unidentified boxer.
and while watching muhammad ali, the greatest boxer in history, pulling off a move like this is one thing, seeing frazier do a back flip after the punch is another and i decided i had enough.
while it may come off as below-average as compared to other gamers, it worked into the career mode wonderfully.
it's obviously supposed to showcase the game (and ali), but with the slow overall look of the action and the horrible collision detection, it actually becomes an omen for what is to come.
i've seen just about all of them on highlight films and they've always been touted as "the battle of the century" and, to be honest, a few of them actually lived up to the hype.
it was supposed to be the first true boxing simulation, allowing me to play as the best fighters to ever grace the boxing ring.
i was dying to see some kind of vicious flurry of blows or something characteristic of ali, instead what i saw was a ridiculous,mortal kombat-style uppercut.
all the boxers, yes all 25 of them, fought with all the pepper of a loaf of bread and had almost identical animations.

i've seen just about all of them on highlight films and they've always been touted as "the battle of the century" and, to be honest, a few of them actually lived up to the hype.
i was pleasantly surprised to see ali pull off his trademark showboating and punches, but what bothered me about those moves was how little they actually helped.
and i was left to wait for the motion-captured animation to end and get pummeled, because i was left totally open for an attack.
what managed to save the game though was its create-a-player feature and the career mode.
true boxing fans should definitely stay away.
the feel of vicious punches was missing, the characters moved too slowly, and none of the fighters distinguished themselves.
i'm sure that black ops thought this too when they finished their design document, but from the conception phase to the production phase, they seemed to have gotten off-track in a big way.
i won the fight, but it was a hollow victory.
ea went out and secured the license for all the great boxers (sans iron mike) and put them in the game.
casual boxing fans dying to take on the boxing world as your favorite boxer should rent this game first.
it's apparent right from the beginning that kk2000 wants to be a sim.
i could create a boxer, train him, and build him up into a championship contender.
i could only tell them apart by their signature moves and that got old quickly.
once i got past the introductions and got the blessing of mills lane (who looks and sounds like the real thing), the fight began.

i know the lineup in this games makes it extremely tempting, but the resulting game is a chore to play and will only disappoint.
the only true representative from the boxing world was mills lane (how sad is that?).kk2000 is an improvement over the originalkk, which says more about the sheer mediocrity ofkk than about any greatness of its sequel.

kk2000 could have been a very good game, but everything starting from the graphics engine to the game mechanics is so bungled that it leaveskk2000 down for the count.- published november 9, 1999 amazon.com recommendations
kk2000 lacked damn near every-thing i saw in those legendary fights with the exception of the fighters themselves.
before i knew it, my punch meter was full and i knew that i could do some kind of "super punch.
if you're dying for a boxing fix, then own the playstation version.

the playstation version includes 50 boxers compared to the n64's 25 and is a much truer simulation than the n64 version.
kk2000 becomes an example of disregarding the player for the sake of landing a license; i would wager that thekk engine had long existed before the licenses were secured and was ported over from some generic boxing game.

add a point system (to tally your performance during a bout) and a training mode, and you have the makings of a great boxing game.

whatever was in the game to add realism was negated by the over-the-top arcade elements.
they used a new face wrapping technology that allows for realistic-looking facial textures to be used for each boxer and black ops copied each boxer's signature moves for even more authenticity.

unfortunately, videogame publishers have not been too cooperative.
anticipation was high and, i must admit, so were my expectations.
i used every punch available and lit into frazier with a vengeance.
it was here that i was not paying attention and frazier caught me with a vicious roundhouse punch (a punch that is performed by hitting the punch button while holding down the r button).
after choosing other boxers, i found nothing new that i didn't experience with my first fight.
when i finally was able to block, i absorbed frazier's assault and proceeded to launch an assault of my own.
when i tried it again, we wound up exchanging punches again to the point where i thought i watching a digital version ofrock'em sock'em robots.
