with larger tubs, often holding 50 to 80 gallons of water (at 8 pounds per gallon), the framing and subfloor may need to be reinforced to support the total weight of the tub, water, and bathers.
because they are handmade, they have uneven faces and vary in color and texture from tile to tile, giving a floor a rustic appearance (figure 6-31).
small chips can be repaired with special sealers, but scratches and burns are permanent.
a ventilating fan must overcome the resistance, called “static pressure,” created by the ductwork, including transitions, elbows, and the wall or roof cap.
use of doormats and frequent sweeping to remove abrasives from the floor will help prolong the finish.
penetrating sealers have the advantage of easy refinishing of worn spots, whereas surface coatings need to be stripped before being reapplied.
energy-efficient models capture waste heat from the motor and pump to provide a modest degree of supplemental heat, while others use a conventional electrical heating element that can maintain the water temperature indefinitely.
although these paints resist chipping, nicks are difficult to touch up and blend in.

these are either site-mixed from a bag or installed by a specialty subcontractor.
it is important to have solidly built drawers, since they get a lot of use and abuse.
typical installations include: backerboard on walls: cbus can go directly over studs at 16 inches on-center or over drywall, and it is fastened with 1 1/2 -inch galvanized roofing nails or special self-countersinking galvanized screws at 6 to 8 inches on-center.
the type and amount of filler largely determines the hardness, stain resistance, and overall durability of the product.
because there is no standardized testing, figuring out which models perform well is difficult.
if the cold water fails or the tempered water is still too hot for any reason, the unit will shut off the flow.
a tile sold for use on floors will not necessarily have a hard scratch-resistant glaze, however.
in addition to providing a visual focal point, durable and easy-to-clean counters are critical for both hygiene and efficiency.
also, with some types of membrane, the contractor can offset the sealant-filled “soft joints” in the tile, so they do not have to fall directly over the crack or control joint in a concrete slab.
while this strategy is helpful, it is not always reliable and can cause other problems: noncompliance: many homeowners turn the thermostats up to increase supply.
neoangle showers: neoangle showers are popular space savers, but the showering area is reduced in size due to the cut-off corner.
for best performance use a heavy-duty sheet membrane, such as 40-mil chloraloy (noble company), which is designed for use in shower pans and similar applications.
the faucet spout in a kitchen should be high enough to accommodate large pots and long enough to reach all the basins in a multi basin model.
weep holes around the bottom of the drain, surrounded by pea gravel or pieces of broken tile, allow any water that accumulates to drain away (seefigure 6-42).
operating properties gravity-flush toilets this is the traditional method, which relies on water dropping from the tank to cleanse the bowl and start a siphon action in the trapway.
walkways, which may have a work counter on one side, should be at least 36 inches wide and should not cross the work triangle (seefigure 6-1).
on walls, 16-inch on-center framing with 2x4s or steel studs is usually adequate.
full-overlay doors also need careful adjustment, since they have only about an 1/8-inch gap to the next door.
one type, called epoxy-emulsion grout, mixes a two-part epoxy with portland cement and sand.
in general, mastics are the least expensive setting material and provide the least strength and flexibility.
the substrate must be very flat, since mastic is troweled on thin and cannot bridge low spots or uneven joints.
it is also useful with questionable substrates such as existing tile, sheet vinyl, or plastic laminate, all of which are suitable for epoxy as long as they are sound and the surfaces are roughed up.
we found that some brands (including kohler™) can list stunning prices for small replacement parts for faucets, cartridges, and handles - df.

a manual override allows normal operation of the fan for other bathroom uses.
between coats, fabricators typically reinforce tub and shower walls and floors with blocks of wood or corrugated cardboard.
handmade pavers, on the other hand, tend to be relatively soft, unglazed, nonvitreous tiles, so they are not suitable for wet interior applications or outdoors in areas subject to freeze/thaw cycles.
a shower pan must be completely watertight and able to hold pooled water should the drain get clogged.
unsuitable substrates that should not be used under tile include oriented-strand board (osb), lower grades of plywood with voids, and interior grade plywoods such as lauan.
the most common method to support the tub bottom and dampen vibration is to set the tub onto several small mounds of wet plaster or mortar mix that compress and conform to the shape of the tub bottom as it is installed.
lever-action handles work well for doors and faucets.
another option for floors are honed or thermal finished granite tiles, which are more commonly used outdoors.
from there, work typically flows to the sink and food prep area, then on to the cooktop or oven, and eating area.
to prevent moisture from passing through the tile and substrate to the plywood or wood framing, a moisture barrier is required in areas subject to high moisture levels or occasional wetting, such as tub surrounds and kitchen counters.

around the perimeter of a room or wherever tile meets a different material or abuts restraining surfaces, such as curbs, columns, or pipes.
one of the premium manufacturers of fiberglass tubs, aqua glass, uses a layer of rigid polyurethane foam between fiberglass coats, creating a stiffer assembly that helps the tub retain heat and deadens sound.
select grade 3 or higher where scratching of the tile surface is a concern.
some store three or more gallons in the tank to create greater pressure, but only let 1.6 gallons drain in each flush.
with high-powered fans, multi speed controls are best so the fan speed (and noise) can be lowered when full power is not required.
because solid surfacing is nonporous, stains do not penetrate and it will not support mold or bacterial growth.
also apply thinset mortar to only one small section at a timeâ€”no larger than the area that can be tiled before the thinset skins over.
in general, they provide excellent resistance against stains, scratches, chips, and fading.
unglazed tiles show the natural color of the clay, although some unglazed mosaics have pigment added to the clay.

to accommodate a seated user, below-counter knee space should be a minimum of 30 inches wide, 27 inches high in front, and 19 inches deep, with a minimum 9-inch-high toe space, which will accommodate most wheelchair footrests.
the tiles will stain, however, so they should be sealed with surface sealers where that is a concern (the material is too dense for penetrating oil sealers).
the plywood should be free of internal voids such as underlayment grade, cc-plugged, or plugged crossbands , and if tiling directly to plywood, it should have a sanded face free of voids, surface resin, or other surface defects.
also if a chip is not repaired quickly, water can penetrate to the backing and cause the damage to spread.
mix the tile grout by hand or with a paddle bit run at slow speed (air bubbles from fast mixing will weaker the mix).
a tile sold for use on floors will not necessarily have a hard scratch-resistant glaze, however.
doors for showers: shower doors must open into the bathroom, not into the shower stall.
also avoid steel sinks with a polished finish, which is difficult to maintain.
the new granite and quartz “engineered stone” composites, on the other hand, are nearly indestructible.
well-made cultured marble, however, treated with reasonable care, can provide years of satisfactory service.
where the tub rim meets tile at a wall or the top of the surround, use a flexible caulk rather than grout, which will crack as the tub flexes, and expands and contracts with temperature changes.
in this case, create soft joints on both sides of the crack or joint (figure 6-38), using a flexible sealant instead of grout.
to guarantee that any trapped water will drain properly, the membrane is placed on a layer of latex-modified mortar sloped 1/4 inch per foot toward the drain.

the material has no gel coat or layers to chip or crack and has color all the way through.
white and light colors show stains the most.
the honed finish must be sealed to prevent permanent staining of the porous marble.
because porcelain is impervious to water absorption and because the mounting sheet can interfere with the bond, it should be installed with a polymer-modified thinset mortar made for use with porcelain.
in general, the longer the clay is fired and the higher the temperature, the denser and stronger the tile will be and the more impervious to water absorption.
irregular-shaped handmade tiles need some adhesive “back buttered” directly to the tile to obtain proper coverage.

tough stains as well as minor scratches or burns can be buffed out of a matte finish with an abrasive cleanser and scotch-brite pad, or wet sanded with very fine sandpaper (start with 1000-grit and use coarser grits as needed).
use of doormats and frequent sweeping to remove abrasives from the floor will help prolong the finish.
if homeowners use abrasive cleansers and pads, over time the finish will dull.
these dense, thick tiles have through-color, making them very durable and suitable for heavy traffic as well as wet or exterior applications.
the most effective way to remove the moisture and contaminants from a cooktop is with an overhead range hood vented to the outdoors.
with gravity flush toilets, it is harder for designers to achieve a sufficient head of water without the height of a standard tank, although redesigning other components has overcome this in at least some models.
light-colored glazes tend to be harder than dark colors and conceal scratches better.
competing with cement backerboard, gypsum products such as georgia pacific’s dens-shield® are designed as tile substrates for damp areas.
the optimal location of grab bars will depend on the users’ specific needs, such as whether they will be sitting or standing and which types of movements they can and cannot perform.

of the two, granite is much more durable and stain-resistant, and is unharmed by mild acids that will etch marble and limestone.
compression valves are the old standby used in traditional two-handle faucets.
widely used in commercial settings, these toilets have a sealed chamber in the tank that fills after each flush, using the home’s water pressure to compress the air trapped inside.
finally, look for securely installed corner blocks or stretchers across the top of the cabinet to hold it square during shipping and installation some high-end cabinets have a full-size top panel to reinforce the top of the box.
where countertop areas of two work centers (e.g., sink, refrigerator, food preparation) overlap, the minimum counter frontage between the centers should equal the longest of the required two lengths plus 12 inches.
the other has dry polymers blended into the dry mix at the factory so only water is added on site.
better quality cabinets use medium-density fiberboard (mdf), and the best generally use 1/2- to 5/8-inch plywood.
agglomerates usually cost less than natural stone, but have many of the same virtues and limitations as their natural counterparts.
these are good for less critical areas that are only occasionally wetted, such as countertops, tub surrounds, and some floors.
polished granite tiles are suitable for kitchen and bath walls, floors, or countertops.
the minimum access space should be the full length of the shower by 36 inches.
the thin gel coat can be damaged, but it is relatively easy to repair with gel-coat repair kits sold in marine and automotive stores.
in addition, gas cooktops produce combustion by-products, including carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, nitrous oxide, and carbon monoxide (see “combustion appliances,” ).
a non shrinking grout such as sonogrout 10k (sonneborn) is best since it will not leave gaps as it dries.

if necessary, the clear floor space may include up to 12 inches of knee space under an adjacent sink.
no major walkway should pass though the triangle, and no corner of an island or peninsula should intersect the triangle by more than 12 inches.
finally, it is critical that the installer leave the required expansion joints at the room perimeter, tub lips, and other places the tile is restrainedâthe source of many tile callbacks.
for example, while it is legal to place bathroom lighting circuits downstream from the gfci outlet, it is unwise since anything that trips the gfci will also plunge the bathroom into darkness.
clearances: allow at least 24 inches of clearance between a cooking surface and a protected surface above, such as a range hood, or 30 inches to an unprotected surface.
for best results, maintain the room temperature between 50°f and 80°f during grouting and curing.

pullout spray spouts are also very convenient, but avoid those with flimsy plastic hoses.
with tile counters, a flexible sealant such as color caulk (color caulk, colton, ca) should be used to seal between the sink and tile.
but the lighter, less rigid substrate does not dampen noise as well and is more likely to chip if a heavy object is dropped.
with tile, use a plywood spacer to raise the flange to the height of the tile.
where possible, provide natural lighting as well from a window or skylight area equal to at least 10% of the floor area.
although a ceramic tile installation is not completely waterproof without the addition of a waterproofing membrane, the tile itself, along with the cement backerboards and thinset mortars used in quality installations, are unaffected by water.
types & choices of drawer slides all drawer slides, even with the same rating, are not alike.
backerboard on floors and countertops: cbus are bonded to the plywood with a layer of latex- or acrylic-modified thinset (figure 6-34 and figure 6-35).
many cabinet manufacturers buy doors and drawer fronts from large specialty door manufacturers, so they may not reflect the overall quality of the cabinets.
do not build steps leading to a bathtub or raised tub platform.
the most common method to support the tub bottom and dampen vibration is to set the tub onto several small mounds of wet plaster or mortar mix that compress and conform to the shape of the tub bottom as it is installed.
although worn marble can be cleaned and re polished, a nonglossy honed finish is a better choice for kitchen floors and counters.
