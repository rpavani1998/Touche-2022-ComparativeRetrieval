just a little confused though, since they started the new "the cleveland show" where cleveland (ofc) has gotten his own show now, are they gonna continue having him in family guy?
not that family guy doesn't do the same thing from time to time, but they do know how to mock reality better than any show ever.

has to be the most random cartoon ever.
futurama is just a sister show of simpsons (same creator/writer)
the simpsons have become somewhat  formulaic like most sitcoms end up being...
he did make an appearance in the last episode though when they broke his tub again, so i'm sure we'll see him again once in a while.
nothing beats the simpsons.
nah i don't know i think simpsons had there time
