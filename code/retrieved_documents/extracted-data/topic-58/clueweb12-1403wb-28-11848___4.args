it will make good impression on viewers to see few good episodes consecutively week by week.
impressed, thought it was going to be simply downhill for a little while.
reply brilliant lets keep it over 9 mil get it back to 10 mil and we will finally see simpsons beating family guy again….
fox was third overall for the night and second among the 18 – 49 demographic.
reply santos l. halper 16 november 2009 at 10:27 pm # pretty good episode.
it’s surely one of the best (if not the best) episode in new season.
really happy that f.g lost to simpsons much better ratings that last season great site!reply yeah!
really happy that f.g lost to simpsons much better ratings that last season great site!
this was fresh episode after almost half a month… anyway, we will see if this high rate trend will continue in the next few episodes, my highest hopes… reply pleco 18 november 2009 at 3:29 am # good episode.
first what you need to know is that between simpsons and family guy have been a great competition since the family guy started as a show on fox.
sherlock holmes had his dr. moriarty, mountain dew has its mellow yellow, even maggie has that baby with the one eyebrow.”
this makes the episode the second highest rated this season, behind ‘bart gets a ‘z’ which had 9.32 million viewers last month.
last night’s episode ‘the devil wears nada’ had a total of 9.04 million viewers.
and just to note, i wish all the luck to family guy, but as long as they are direct competition to the simpsons, i can’t say that i would like to see them in the air instead of simpsons… reply fliz 18 november 2009 at 5:37 pm # @pleco – just like lisa said in 1f18, “everybody needs a nemesis.
it was a great episode too, though carl was too harsh to homer – reminds me of how harsh paul is to barry in chucklevision reply homermarge 17 november 2009 at 3:36 pm # awesome ratings, awesome episode!
i’m very happy with this numbers, and i’m so glad that simpsons finally got higher rates that the family guy!!!
i don’t think that f.g. is bad show (although i don’t like kind of art, or the way gags are presented in show), but i surely like simpsons much, much more, and i can say that i’m really proud on the simpsons when i see that their ratings are better than family guys.
reply awesome. season 21 is shaping up to be a great.

also the level of detail that is now in episodes, like the backgrounds etc really adds something new.

this makes me so happy.

i hope that rates are not this high just because simpsons made a little two-week break.
i suspect awesome ratings, sound stuff.
i’m happy to hear that it beat fg.
impressed, thought it was going to be simply downhill for a little while.
reason for that is surely cause f.g. made simpsons ratings much lower, they literally took over over 1/4 (or even more) of old viewers from the simpsons.

i agree with mr tim, carl was harsh to homer.

well done!reply pretty good episode.
i say we be glad both shows are doing great so they will be on for years to come.
the simpsons figures were helped by the overrun of the preceding football match but kept it on top for the night.
it’s surely one of the best (if not the best) episode in new season.
it will stabilize ratings, and hopefully will make real break through after few not-so-great seasons, just what this show needs!reply the episode was ok not the best so far but still ok my overall score is 7.7/10 name (required) mail (will not be published) (required) website rate: them, robot view results | polls archiveloading ...
the cleveland show followed with 7.01 million viewers, while a usually-dominant family guy had 8.28 million viewers at 9:00 (yes, it was a new episode too).
very funny episode hopefully now fox will keep going with the simpsons!
