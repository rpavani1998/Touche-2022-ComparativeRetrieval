it is estimated that with a single battery charge, the audi e-tron can cover more than 86miles; while it can achieve top speeds of 90mph and race from 0-62mph in 11.2seconds.
the audi a3 e-tron is a five-seat electric vehicle based on a production audi a3 that features a permanent magnet synchronous motor with output of 60kw and peak output of 85kw. its maximum torque is 270nm; while its energy storage comes from a lithium-ion battery that stores 26.5kwh of usable energy at 380volts and weighs 300kilograms.
the vehicle places the emphasis on the driver, who can choose between three different driver profile modes.
there’s dynamic mode, with the electric motor delivering its full power, with the air conditioner also working in full; auto mode, where both systems are throttled back to extend range; and efficiency mode, which is designed for maximum range with the electric motor limited to 50kw. in addition, the driver can influence energy recovery by choosing from four recuperation levels.
this means that when the driver applies pressure to the brake, an electromagnetic brake boost pressurises the hydraulic wheel brakes with the electric motor acting as a generator and recovering energy.

the vehicle places the emphasis on the driver, who can choose between three different driver profile modes.
at the lowest level, the audi a3 e-tron can glide freely when the driver releases the accelerator; while at the highest level, the car brakes strongly and the electric motor acts as a generator.
