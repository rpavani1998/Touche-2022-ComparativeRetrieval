audi does utility all this talk about driving dynamics is a little beside the point, though, as a utility vehicle — especially an audi utility vehicle — is meant to be a little bit more about the experience of riding in the vehicle than operating the machinery.
and i think you'll agree it's got something none of the other german or japanese compact crossovers have, and that's an ability to appeal to awide range of people looking for a premium utility vehicle with few compromises.
the power tailgate is broad and helps promote a low liftover height into the cargo compartment.
this system might sound like a gimmick, but the difference in the way the q5 behaves is immediately noticeable whenever you switch from mode to mode.
there is no price discount just because it has a tall roof and a clamshell hatch.
but there could be a more affordable version of the q5 on the way, as the audi people tell us candidly that the newfound appreciation among americans for the price of gasoline (and all things automotive in general) has made it likely that we'll soon see this crossover with the turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 with its 211 hp and 253 lb-ft of torque.
my only dynamic gripe is that the q5 could've benefited from more rear-bias within its awd system — like the so-not-like-an-audi s5 so obviously has.
the stability control remains active and grabs the front brakes very aggressively — the sort of anti-rollover thing you find in any tall utility vehicle — but it still turns a speed of 61.9 mph.
there's even a special sensor that recalibrates the stability control when the electronics detect that the roof rack is being used, since the vehicle's center of gravity has changed.

and as a utility vehicle should be, the 2009 audi q5 is a little miracle of clever utility.
there's none of the carved-from-carbon-steel, heavy-footed german thing that makes theaudi q7 feel like a hummer in a hugo boss suit.
and thanks to electronics that help configure the q5's power, handling and control feel for the sporting driver, this audi also tries to deliver the personalized performance of the new coupe-style crossovers like the bmw x6 and forthcoming acura zdx.
for all this, though, audi's strength continues to be simple transportation, vehicles that take you down the road and deliver you safely.
the seats are great and three-zone air-conditioning is standard.
we like the new terrain mode, which gives you a true three-dimensional view of the oncoming road using terrain data originally recorded by the space shuttle.
for all this, though, the 2009 audi q5 makes sense to us in a way that few other crossovers do.
under braking, the q5 stops from 60 mph in 117 feet, and the brakes are effective and fade-free on every stop, while dynamic mode makes a slight bit of difference in reducing brake dive.
instead they are what they were meant to be, sedans that have been stretched and folded into a slightly different shape.

somehow the a4's newly rearranged drivetrain components and the latest torque split for the all-wheel-drive system (40 percent front/60 percent rear) seem to make a more noticeable difference in this 4,327-pound package than the 3,870-pound 2008 audi a4 sedan we last tested.
the u.s.-specification q5 also comes already equipped with a towing package as standard equipment, and it's rated for 4,400 pounds, which is 900 pounds more than the best of its competition.
it's stylish, luxurious and powerful, yet this is an audi that's content to be itself, rather than striving to be an alternative to a bmw or a mercedes-benz or even a porsche.
there are spaces for 1-liter water bottles in every door and a thermo-controlled cupholder in the center console.
this system might sound like a gimmick, but the difference in the way the q5 behaves is immediately noticeable whenever you switch from mode to mode.
these are fine pieces, sparkling evidence of audi's ability to think laterally and develop examples of unexpectedly useful technology, a tradition that began with the inline-5 engine, moved on into all-wheel drive and has since popularized everything from direct fuel injection to led running lights.
there is no price discount just because it has a tall roof and a clamshell hatch.
there are levers in the cargo area to flip down the second-row seats for loading convenience.
the audi vector none of this matters when you're rolling down the road, because the q5 brings the refinement of an audi to the whole highway proposition.
the manufacturer provided edmunds this vehicle for the purposes of evaluation.
the q5's electronics configure throttle response, transmission shift points, steering effort and suspension setting according to four different parameters: comfort, automatic, dynamic and individual.

the stability control remains active and grabs the front brakes very aggressively — the sort of anti-rollover thing you find in any tall utility vehicle — but it still turns a speed of 61.9 mph.
the field of view is commanding, obstructed only by the outside rearview mirrors, devices that seem to grow ever larger by federal mandate, which is one reason why you never see anyone turn their head to check a vehicle's blind spot before changing lanes (much less use the turn signal).
unlike some of its natural competitors, it successfully walks the tightrope between too-boring luxury and too-harsh performance.
scaled up from the platform of the audi a4 sedan, the q5 measures 182 inches overall, 74.8 inches wide and 65.2 inches high.
through the slalom, the q5 proves surprisingly well balanced, and it turns into the gates crisply with a sensation of nicely weighted steering — very different from any audi of only a few years ago.

there's blind-spot protection warning.
the 3.2-liter v6 is more than sufficient to propel the 4,300-pound all-wheel-drive q5, and the multimode transmission is well matched with the output.
we noticed a distinct difference in steering effort between the comfort and dynamic modes.

of course, this attribute could also be its undoing, as it could earn criticism for being neither smooth nor fun.
bottom lineall things to all people, only in a good way.
these are fine pieces, sparkling evidence of audi's ability to think laterally and develop examples of unexpectedly useful technology, a tradition that began with the inline-5 engine, moved on into all-wheel drive and has since popularized everything from direct fuel injection to led running lights.
when it came to acceleration, we discovered a half-second difference in quarter-mile time between automatic mode with the stability control engaged and dynamic mode with the stability control switched off.

indeed, the q5 affords 101.5 cubic feet of living space, with 29.1 cubic feet of cargo capacity behind the second seat and 67.3 cubic feet with the second seat folded.
it's a couple inches longer than a bmw x3, land rover lr2 and mercedes-benz glk, roughly the same size as an infiniti ex35 andvolvo xc60, and a handful of inches shorter than a lexus rx 350.

maybe this is a lesson that crossovers are not part-time utility boxes.

we found ourselves looking closely at the $37,200 price of a base-model q5 and wondering what it would be like, while simultaneously scanning this vehicle's options list and wondering what we'd delete (to some, the drive select system and 19-inch wheels seemed likely targets).

you don't have to twist it hard enough to get peak output, as the standard six-speed automatic sweeps you along on the broad crest of the torque curve.
as always, the aesthetic experience is wonderful, as the combination of high-quality, soft-touch materials, design architecture that doesn't try to visually intimidate you, and a sound driving position really set any audi apart from the competition.
in comparison, the lexus rx 350 has 100.9 cubic feet of interior passenger space, 40 cubic feet of cargo capacity behind the second seat and 80.3 cubic feet of capacity when the second seat is folded.
the steering isn't too light (unlike like that of pre-2009 audi products), and the nifty comfort/auto/dynamic/individual meta-controller offers palpable differences in vehicle behavior.
as with any crossover, there is a lot of weight to move around, but the 3.2-liter audi v6 does a good job of it.

you don't have to twist it hard enough to get peak output, as the standard six-speed automatic sweeps you along on the broad crest of the torque curve.
there's still a teeny-weeny bit of understeer on the limit (and non-defeat stability control), so a slight sharpening up wouldn't hurt it otherwise.
of course, if you're looking for some kind of premium flagship, then the audi guys will wave you over to the midengine r8 sports car or perhaps the s5 coupe or even the q7 v10 turbodiesel sport-utility.
considering the q5 is meant to belong to the class of relatively compact crossovers, it's difficult to rationalize when anaudi a6 sedan is staring you in the face for the same price.

the q5 also incorporates the new third-generation mmi interface for the navigation and infotainment systems, so good in its combination of layout and controls that the new bmw idrive is simply a pretty frank copy.
it's a couple inches longer than a bmw x3, land rover lr2 and mercedes-benz glk, roughly the same size as an infiniti ex35 andvolvo xc60, and a handful of inches shorter than a lexus rx 350.
the ride is supple for a crossover, even with the optional 19-inch 235/55r19 goodyear ls2 tires, and the overall message is refinement instead of ersatz off-road capability.
we like the new terrain mode, which gives you a true three-dimensional view of the oncoming road using terrain data originally recorded by the space shuttle.
around the skid pad, the q5 records 0.80g in dynamic, and while the stability control remained active at the limit even when switched off, it intervenes very precisely, first trimming speed with brake applications before chopping the throttle.
