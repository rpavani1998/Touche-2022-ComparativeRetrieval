physical therapy appears to be more effective than medical care alone for reducing disability in some patients, but the magnitude of this possible benefit is minimal.
[22] the active approach used by the physical therapy staff may be responsible for the relatively better 6-month disability outcomes experienced by the physical therapy patients.
chiropractors at the study site use the same general type of spinal manipulation taught in most chiropractic schools and used by most chiropractors in the united states.
cherkin et a [l9] reported no differences between chiropractic and mckenzie physical therapy groups during 2 years of follow-up in terms of pain and disability, and these groups had only slightly better outcomes and much greater costs than did patients in the control group receiving only an educational booklet.
the authors of a well-designed observational study concluded that among patients with low back pain of less than 10 weeks duration seen by primary care physicians, chiropractors, and orthopedic surgeons, pain and functional status outcomes were similar at 6 months, and costs were higher for patients of orthopedic surgeons and chiropractors.

the authors of review papers and treatment guidelines have concluded that acetaminophen, [5,14] nsaids, [ 5,11,14,28,49] muscle relaxants, [11,49] conditioning exercises and certain aerobic activities, [5] and spinal manipulation [5,40] may provide shortterm benefit for patients with acute low back pain; nsaids, [ 49] exercise therapy, [19,49] and spinal manipulation [49] may be of some benefit for patients with chronic low back pain.
[ 36,49] adverse reactions are much more frequent in patients taking medications than in patients receiving nonmedication comparison treatments.
medical and chiropractic care without physical therapy or physical modalities yielded similar improvements in pain severity and disability after 6 months of follow-up.
[10,12] the medical providers prescribe nsaids, muscle relaxants, and narcotic analgesics, which is the typical treatment approach used by primary care physicians for patients with low back pain.
medical providers, chiropractors, and physical therapists outside this network may differ in their approaches to low back pain care; and patients under fee-for-service, workers’ compensation, personal injury, and other reimbursement models may differ in ways that affect treatment outcomes.
physical therapy appears to be more effective than medical care alone for reducing disability in some patients after 6 months, but the magnitude of this possible benefit is not large.
conclusions: after 6 months of follow-up, chiropractic care and medical care for low back pain were comparable in their effectiveness.
also, patients who chose not to be randomly assigned may differ from participants on factors that modify treatment effects.
a recent randomized clinical trial comparing osteopathic care with standard medical care in amanaged care setting found equivalent pain and disability outcomes among patients with subacute (3 weeks to 6months) low back pain after 12 weeks of care, but there was greater prescription medication use in the medical care
nevertheless, our study population is similar to other outpatient low back pain populations in terms of average baseline level of back pain [9,29,30] and baseline level of disability resulting from back pain.

[8 ] the findings from prior studies are consistent with our results showing relatively small differences between medical, chiropractic, and physical therapy care.
[38] concluded that acute pain patients were better with chiropractic at 3 weeks; chronic patients were better with physical therapy at 3 weeks; and there were no differences between groups at 6 months.
the slightly better 6-month disability outcomes observed for physical therapy patients in our study are consistent with findings reported recently from physical therapy intervention studies for subacute and chronic low back pain.
assessment of the costs and potential risks associated with each treatment strategy would be helpful in more fully understanding the roles of medical providers, chiropractors, and physical therapists in the treatment of low back pain.
overall, there are only small differences in low back pain outcomes between the treatment groups in this population of largely subacute and chronic pain patients.
[21] because many of the medical care with physical therapy patients in our study did not receive physical therapy, the intention-to-treat analysis may have underestimated the magnitude of this effect.
physical therapy yielded somewhat better 6-month disability outcomes than did medical care alone (1.26, 0.20-2.32).

- six hundred eighty-one patients presenting to a managed care facility were randomly assigned to medical care with and without physical therapy and chiropractic care with and without physical modalities; 95.7% were followed up through 6 months.
the mean changes in low back pain intensity and disability of participants in the medical and chiropractic care-only groups were similar at each follow-up assessment (adjusted mean differences at 6 months for most severe pain, 0.27, 95% confidence interval, -0.32-0.86; average pain, 0.22, -0.25-0.69; and disability, 0.75, -0.29-1.79).
findings from a national network of physical therapy practices showed that the combination of modalities and exercise is the most frequently used treatment strategy for patients with lumbar impairments.

[27] although this study also showed managed care and fee-for-service reimbursement do not appreciably affect utilization patterns, [27] an earlier survey of physical therapists demonstrated differences in treatment preferences and visit frequency by practice setting.
[34] in patients with chronic pain, physical therapy and medically supervised exercise were found to be better than unsupervised exercise in terms of pain intensity, functional status, and cost per sick day after 12 months following 3 months of therapy in norway.
the findings suggest that physical therapy patients may have greater reductions in disability, on average, than do patients in the medical care-only group from 6 weeks to 6 months, resulting in relatively better 6-month disability outcomes; however, these small differences may be chance findings and may not persist with continued follow- up.
key points - a randomized clinical trial was conducted among low back pain patients to compare the effectiveness of medical and chiropractic care; to assess the effectiveness of physical therapy among medical patients; and to assess the effectiveness of physical modalities among chiropractic patients.
[48] the greater value of supervised exercise for patients with chronic low back pain is also supported by another recent trial that followed patients for 2 years.

[42,43] reported no differences between chiropractic and physical therapy patients at 6 months or 1 year in terms of pain, function, cost, or sick leave, although chiropractic was slightly more favorable for patients with episodes of less than a week and physical therapy more favorable for patients with episodes of more than a month.
[7,29,39,44,47] however, differences on other unmeasured factors and treatment effects that may be relatively larger in certain patient subgroups could potentially limit the studys generalizability.
