hybrid cars combine a conventional petrol engine with an electric motor.
most can run in electric-only mode, which means zero-emissions.

electric and hybrid cars are in the department for transport’s a or b rating bands – the tops bands – for being the most environmentally friendly of today’s cars.

they can also attract lowertax bandings than petrol counterparts, and are usually exempt from schemes such as london's congestion charge.
however, a channel 4 study of hybrid vehicles explains there are different hybrid systems, which use different combinations of energy sources.
that said, experts say that it may cost less to maintain a hybrid car, compared with petrol or diesel, due to decreased wear and tear on the engine and braking system.
this means their co2 emissions are below 100g/km (band a) or between 101 and 120g/km (band b).
this is particularly beneficial in cities and during stop-start driving at low-speeds.

however, most experts agree that cars powered by hydrogen will not arrive for another 10 to 20 years.

this can help to reduce running costs over the life of the car.
in addition, hybrid battery packs are designed to last for the lifetime of the vehicle, which is somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000 miles.
but, thechannel 4 study says, 'overall, given the high purchase costs compared to a mainstream car, a comparable diesel-engine model is often cheaper to run – and emits less carbon dioxide.'
the future hydrogen fuel cell technology is on the horizon and could eventually offer a greener alternative to today’s hybrid car.
they can also attract lowertax bandings than petrol counterparts, and are usually exempt from schemes such as london's congestion charge.
plus, the first hydrogen-powered cars are likely to use more than one energy source, so they’ll be considered hybrid cars too.
when it comes to maintenance, a hybrid doesn't tend to cost any more than a conventional car, but dealer service centres can charge a little more for servicing hybrid cars.

the rating guide runs from a through to g. disadvantages some of the disadvantages of using a hybrid car include the following: they can be expensive to buy compared with conventional cars hybrids are not as cost-efficient for people doing mainly motorway mileage driving in cities can sap the batteries, which means the petrol engine has to take over boot space can be limited as space is taken by the electric power-train and batteries battery toxicity is a concern, though today's hybrids use recyclable nimh batteries, not nicad counting the cost hybrid cars are popular, and are therefore holding their resale values at present.
the car has a computer system which decides which energy source to use at different times, based on maximizing efficiency.
as cruising speeds are reached, the electric motor is turned off, leaving petrol power only.
when it comes to maintenance, a hybrid doesn't tend to cost any more than a conventional car, but dealer service centres can charge a little more for servicing hybrid cars.
as the driver starts to slow down – and this is the clever bit – the electric motor becomes a generator and transfers the kinetic energy of the car into the battery as electric power.

the study says, 'the honda insight, for example, will use the petrol engine only when moving off from rest and at low speeds, but when accelerating, its computer asks the electric motor to chip in with extra help.
this enables them to deliver improved fuel economy and reduced carbon dioxide emissions.

whatever type of car you chose, privilege can help you find the right car insurance.
hybrid cars use both a petrol engine and electric motors, and the energy used by the electric motors is stored in rechargeable batteries.
