the left-hand dial in the instrument panel indicates the percentage of power used or recovered during phases of braking or deceleration.
this frees up a gigantic 1501 litre compartment that is easy to load.
the large grab handle on the centre console enables them to find the ideal position for a comfortable journey.
this “high voltage” stop & start system with a generous output of 8 kw can also generate the electricity needed for operation of the electric motor under all circumstances if required (four wheel drive mode).
three different scales indicate the battery status: charge, eco (optimal operating range), power. suppliers to develop its hybrid4 technology, the psa peugeot citroën group has teamed up with suppliers offering the best know-how in each field.
since diesel engines consume less fuel than petrol engines, they are the ideal choice for this type of hybridization.
hybrid technology uses two power trains which can operate alternately or simultaneously: - the hdi diesel engine operates in its most optimal operating window on longer, out-of-town journeys.
a real breakthrough in terms of improved fuel consumption and co2 emissions, dynamic performance levels, four wheel drive, electric only mode, etc, the hybrid4 technology brings a number of benefits without any compromises.
the 3008 hybrid4 therefore stands out by its visual signature, but also by the fact that it is the first 3008 to receive the marque’s new badge on its bonnet.
here too, the presence of a “hobby” lower tailgate, and the wide black and chrome protective trims on the lower section, illustrate the “outdoor” feel of this crossover.
the choice of architecture was also guided by the search for optimal efficiency and consistency.
high-voltage battery pack the ni-mh (nickel metal hydride) batteries are located under the boot sill, near the electric motor.
combined with the folding front passenger seat, the 3008 hybrid4 offers a perfectly flat floor from the hobby to the fascia panel.
the 3008 hybrid4 thus offers a new and highly technological approach to motoring, combining renewed driving enjoyment with a very low level of co2 emissions.
a viable technical and economic solution the rear installation of the vehicle’s “electric components” provides a new technical and economic solution.
distinctive materials are deployed throughout to accentuate the crossover feel and explore new avenues of expression.
inside the car too, the hybridization of concepts opens up unsuspected possibilities.
in the future, and for markets where diesel is less popular, a petrol combustion engine may also serve as the base for hybrid4 type hybridization.
the driver can apply this mode to drive discreetly around town or demonstrate the silence of the vehicle in electric mode, etc, - four-wheel drive mode (4wd) instructs both power trains to operate together as far as possible; the rear wheels are then driven by the electric motor and the front wheels by the hdi diesel engine.
the ring of the steering wheel bearing the signature “hybrid4” hy for its part adds a touch of exclusivity to the car.
here, the external style successfully evokes the vehicle’s high innovative content.
in the medium term, this battery technology remains the most appropriate in terms of cost and industrialisation for vehicles produced in large volumes.
this accentuates the imposing height of the waistline, which with its exclusive 17’’ oltis alloy wheels and black waist moulding, contributes to the sense of strength apparent in the vehicle as a whole.
secondly, this architecture is achieved by means of the use of a simple and compact rear module containing the electric motor, its ancillary equipment and also the rear drive train and suspension.
the end result is a crossover with a length of 4.36 m, four wheel drive, a maximum power output of 200 bhp, fuel consumption in the combined cycle of only 3.8 litres/100 km and emissions of 99 g/km!
combined with the folding front passenger seat, the 3008 hybrid4 offers a perfectly flat floor from the hobby to the fascia panel.
this high-voltage battery pack comes in addition to the standard 12v battery under the bonnet, which carries on performing its normal duties.
the ptmu is an electronic controller that automatically manages the different operating modes of the hdi diesel engine and electric motor in a very innovative way for the driver, helping optimise fuel consumption.
hybrid technology uses two power trains which can operate alternately or simultaneously: - the hdi diesel engine operates in its most optimal operating window on longer, out-of-town journeys.
at the front, peugeot’s stylistic codes have been adapted to the car’s generous dimensions to mark a break with what has gone before.
on higher specification versions, emissions can rise to 104 or 108 g/km of co2 in the combined cycle.
the driver can apply this mode to drive discreetly around town or demonstrate the silence of the vehicle in electric mode, etc, - four-wheel drive mode (4wd) instructs both power trains to operate together as far as possible; the rear wheels are then driven by the electric motor and the front wheels by the hdi diesel engine.
energy recovery an energy recovery system (when the electric motor becomes a generator) enables kinetic energy to be transformed into electrical energy to recharge the ni-mh batteries during deceleration (release of the accelerator and braking).
the 3008 hybrid4 therefore stands out by its visual signature, but also by the fact that it is the first 3008 to receive the marque’s new badge on its bonnet.
the design of the multi-arm rear suspension is the fruit of all of the marque’s expertise in this field, bearing in mind that the same technology is also employed on the 407, recognised for its excellent driveability, road holding and comfort.
in the future, and for markets where diesel is less popular, a petrol combustion engine may also serve as the base for hybrid4 type hybridization.
peugeot’s choice of the diesel hybrid demonstrates that it is possible to combine uncompromising environmental demands with driving sensations not previously available in a hybrid vehicle.
from the boot, a rear seat folding system, controlled by switches mounted on the load area side trims, allows the seats in the second row to be folded automatically, as if by magic.
changeover from the hdi diesel engine to the electric motor occurs automatically, thanks to astop & start system which places the hdi diesel engine in standby and restarts it as and when conditions require (accelerator pedal usage, low battery charge level, etc), - the two power sources also complement each other in certain driving conditions (“boost” effect during strong acceleration, when overtaking another vehicle, for example).
inside its roomy architecture and the driving position bears all the hallmarks of a top-of-the-range coupé, or even an aircraft cockpit.
lastly, a latest-generation satellite navigation system helps to guide users on their travels.
at the rear, the curved wings blend seamlessly with the hi-tech lights.
offering peace of mind, safety and driveability, four-wheel drive accentuates the vehicle’s dynamic character.
the new peugeot 3008 hybrid4 stands out due to its cutting-edge technology, allowing a seamless combination of responsible driving and driving enjoyment, but also by its specific styling.
this “high voltage” stop & start system with a generous output of 8 kw can also generate the electricity needed for operation of the electric motor under all circumstances if required (four wheel drive mode).
at the end of 2010, peugeot will continue in this vein by becoming the first manufacturer to launch a latest-generation 100% electric vehicle in europe, the peugeot i0n.
it enhances this technological ambience in the same way as the 7’’ colour display which provides information on the energy flows.
four wheel drive this original layout allows the possibility of four wheel drive: the hdi diesel engine under the bonnet drives the front wheels, while the electric motor (in the rear drive train) drives the rear wheels.
man-machine interface a 7’’ 16/9 colour screen or a multi-function display, according to the car’s specification, informs the driver in real time of the operating status of the hybrid power train and the battery charge status by means of an 8 bar electronic gauge system.
this successful crossover results from the hybridization of several motoring concepts: suv, saloon, compact mpv, coupé… added to this are the benefits of hybrid4, which in the present case and for the first time combines diesel and electric power to offer the perfect response to customer expectations: “ecological” four wheel drive, controlled power, a high level of safety, assured modularity and a new driving sensation, all within an environmentally responsible approach.
combined with a raised and dominating driving position it has everything in place to reward its drivers and offer a range of new driving sensations not previously found in a hybrid vehicle.
these sensations are enhanced further by the general ambience of the passenger compartment: high-tech and exclusive.
it also allows the 3008 hybrid4 to be recognised by the integration of familiar features.
on the 3008 hybrid4, these components have been made as small as possible to optimise the installation in the vehicle.
the “hybrid” power train basically combines a diesel engine and an electric motor.
enables the driver to choose between four different operating modes: - “auto” mode: the electronics automatically control the entire system, including transitions between the hdi diesel engine and the electric motor.
an expansive fascia panel, controls within easy hand’s reach and an ergonomic centre console clearly separate the territory of the pilot.
combined with a raised and dominating driving position it has everything in place to reward its drivers and offer a range of new driving sensations not previously found in a hybrid vehicle.
the performance of the hybrid4 is therefore directly comparable to that obtained with a single hdi diesel engine of a much higher capacity, with good levels of responsiveness backed by a real breakthrough in terms of reduced fuel consumption and co2 emissions (around 35% less in the combined cycle for equivalent performance).
in terms of performance, the 3008 hybrid4 can benefit from the combined power of the hdi diesel engine and electric motor during acceleration, for an immediate surge in power (“boost” function).
in this case, activation of the hdi diesel engine is programmed to coincide with more sustained phases of acceleration.
firstly, it avoids the need for any major redesign of the engine compartment, while also allowing a better weight distribution.
driving pleasure contrary to current beliefs, the use of hybrid technology also offers improved driving freedom and introduces new benefits at several levels: - high performance combined with excellent driveability, - freedom and simplicity of use with the possibility of choosing four different operating modes: zev, 4wd, sport, auto, - silent operation, with the possibility of driving in electric only mode, - peace of mind offered by the safety inherent in four wheel drive, - environmental friendliness with emissions starting from 99 g/km of co2.
driving aids: high-tech equipment for safety and driving enjoyment comfortably seated behind the steering wheel, drivers will note among the equipment at their disposal certain references to the world of aviation.
peugeot’s choice of the diesel hybrid demonstrates that it is possible to combine uncompromising environmental demands with driving sensations until now not available in a hybrid vehicle.
this recovery system enables the driver to use “free” energy and reduce fuel consumption accordingly.
a diesel engine still remains the most efficient and versatile choice to power any vehicle, - the electric motor takes over from the hdi diesel engine in phases of lower power demands, particularly when starting up or driving at low speed and decelerating (energy recovery).
the customer benefits are immediate with a high level specification and a reduction of 35% in fuel consumption, a real breakthrough for a car of this size and performance.
secondly, this architecture is achieved by means of the use of a simple and compact rear module containing the electric motor, its ancillary equipment and also the rear drive train and suspension.
this brings about significant gains in fuel consumption and emissions in urban conditions.
with a 3008 benefiting from hybrid4 technology, the aim is to appeal to customers who expect not only environmental-friendliness and technological sophistication, but also real driving enjoyment.
here, the external style successfully evokes the vehicle’s high innovative content.
simplicity of use from a functional point of view, a selection knob on the centre console enables the driver to choose between four different operating modes: - “auto” mode: the electronics automatically control the entire system, including transitions between the hdi diesel engine and the electric motor.
they also benefit from numerous storage spaces, particularly in the rear floor and the generous centre console at the front.
by launching the world’s first full diesel hybrid vehicle, the 3008 hybrid4, peugeot will create a new type of vehicle in terms of freedom of use and driving enjoyment.
with the 3008 hybrid4 crossover, the environmentally-friendly combination of diesel and electric power also paves the way for: - 4 wheel drive, - a maximum power of 200 bhp, - zev mode (zero emission vehicle), - 3.8 litres/100 km, with 99 g/km of co2.
the ptmu is an electronic controller that automatically manages the different operating modes of the hdi diesel engine and electric motor in a very innovative way for the driver, helping optimise fuel consumption.
technical details of the 3008 hybrid4 at the front the 2.0 litre hdi fap 120 kw (163 bhp) diesel engine with a capacity of 1997 cm³, this euro 5 engine develops a maximum power of 120 kw at 3750 rpm and a maximum torque of 300 nm at 1580 rpm.
finally, multiple impressions emanate from the style of the car: tranquil strength, contained power, controlled dynamism… comfort: driving and sharing interior ambience:
the electric motor and its ancillary equipment (inverter, converter, etc) are fitted at the rear of the vehicle.
since diesel engines consume less fuel than petrol engines, they are the ideal choice for this type of hybridization.
it must also provide new driving sensations, improved driveability and improved driving enjoyment.
energy recovery an energy recovery system (when the electric motor becomes a generator) enables kinetic energy to be transformed into electrical energy to recharge the ni-mh batteries during deceleration (release of the accelerator and braking).
in the final analysis, the 3008 hybrid4 is a crossover with an exceptional technological content offering unique versatility and safety, unrivalled driving pleasure and co2 emissions of a very low level.
in terms of performance, the 3008 hybrid4 can benefit from the combined power of the hdi diesel engine and electric motor during acceleration, for an immediate surge in power (“boost” function).

these include the jukebox function, linked to the presence of a hard disc, the gsm function, a usb connector, a dvd player, the bluetooth®system and also a graphic interface which shows city buildings in “full 3d”.
in keeping with the notion of the hybridization of genres, the car’s passenger compartment is a new source of surprise and emotion.
the hdi diesel engine is linked to an electronically-controlled manual six-speed sequential gearbox: - its electronic control enables significant savings in fuel consumption, in automatic mode, compared to a traditional automatic gearbox or even a traditional manual gearbox, - it offers real driving enjoyment gained from the possibility of choosing the gear change mode at any time - manual or automatic - with the gear lever or via controls behind the steering wheel.
for example, to ensure that drivers need never take their eyes from the road, in the manner of a fighter plane, essential driving information is projected onto a retractable transparent panel which cleverly extends from the instrument panel visor.
this accentuates the imposing height of the waistline, which with its exclusive 17’’ oltis alloy wheels and black waist moulding, contributes to the sense of strength apparent in the vehicle as a whole.
similarly, the electric parking brake (fse) coupled with the hill assist function, facilitates the driver’s manoeuvres and optimises space in place of the manual hand brake.
the rear module of the hybrid4 system also includes a multi-arm rear suspension system providing the guarantee of excellent road holding.
this level of performance gives the 3008 hybrid4 record-breaking credentials in terms of the co2 emissions/ maximum power ratio.
an expansive fascia panel, controls within easy hand’s reach and an ergonomic centre console clearly separate the territory of the pilot.

similarly, sanyo has provided its extensive knowledge in the field of ni-mh high-voltage batteries .
the hybrid4 strategy capitalising on the best know-how hybrid4 technology is based on the combined use of the best technologies developed by peugeot’s engineers: diesel engine, electric motor, second-generationstop & start and an electronically-controlled sequential manual gearbox.
driving enjoyment for the next generation for peugeot, the legitimacy of this technology goes well beyond its eco-efficiency.
on higher specification versions, emissions can rise to 104 or 108 g/km of co2 in the combined cycle.
it also leaves intact the possibility of using larger capacity engines.
pursuing this common sense approach of capitalising on the best existing components and expertise, it was only natural to use the electronically-controlled 6-speed manual gearbox (mcp), not only for its engine management capabilities but also for its optimisation of fuel consumption.
virtuous association an obvious association adapting hybrid4 technology to the 3008 crossover makes obvious sense.
the maximum combined power output can then reach 147 kw (200 bhp) through the addition of 120 kw (163 bhp) from the 2.0 litre hdi fap diesel engine and the temporary peak of the electric motor (27 kw, or 37 bhp).
the costs of the rear module are, therefore, reduced because of the technical possibility of deploying hybrid4 technology in different segments, on different body shapes, etc, regardless of the type of combustion engine used.
this high-voltage battery pack comes in addition to the standard 12v battery under the bonnet, which carries on performing its normal duties.

here too, the presence of a “hobby” lower tailgate, and the wide black and chrome protective trims on the lower section, illustrate the “outdoor” feel of this crossover.
indeed hybrid4 technology, at low speed, allows all-terrain capabilities equivalent to those of an suv: the driver will no longer be worried by the prospect of a muddy path or a snowbound uphill drive to the ski resort; - “sport” mode favours quicker gear changes at higher engine speeds than normal mode.
a maximum torque of 500 nm is available, split 300 nm at the front from the hdi diesel engine and a maximum of 200 nm at the rear generated by the electric motor.
based on the manufacturer’s technical specifications, bosch has provided its expertise with respect to the electric motor, the power electronics, the reversible high-voltage alternator (stt) and other systems managing the dialogue between these components and the braking and trajectory correction systems (abs and esp).
in terms of “vehicle dynamics”, the esp of the 3008 hybrid4 incorporates an “improved traction control system” (asr) able to exploit the car’s four wheel drive capabilities to the full on challenging surfaces.
the inverter controls the torque of the electric motor by regulating the current from the high-voltage battery pack.

the vehicle then becomes a “city run-around” par excellence thanks to the total absence of noise and emissions.
the left-hand dial in the instrument panel indicates the percentage of power used or recovered during phases of braking or deceleration.
this allows optimal driving with a mix of low fuel consumption and dynamic driveability, - “zev” mode (zero emission vehicle) provides access to an extensive all-electric mode.
the large grab handle on the centre console enables them to find the ideal position for a comfortable journey.
the performance of the hybrid4 is therefore directly comparable to that obtained with a single hdi diesel engine of a much higher capacity, with good levels of responsiveness backed by a real breakthrough in terms of reduced fuel consumption and co2 emissions (around 35% less in the combined cycle for equivalent performance).
thanks to its intelligent multiflex interior and clever integration of the batteries and the special rear suspension, the 3008 hybrid4 can also be transformed to offer a considerable load capacity under the parcel shelf of 420 litres (362 dm3 vda), with 66 litres (29 dm3 vda) consisting of storage under the boot floor.

the inverter controls the torque of the electric motor by regulating the current from the high-voltage battery pack.
they also benefit from numerous storage spaces, particularly in the rear floor and the generous centre console at the front.
offering peace of mind, safety and driveability, four-wheel drive accentuates the vehicle’s dynamic character.
the hdi diesel engine is linked to an electronically-controlled manual six-speed sequential gearbox: - its electronic control enables significant savings in fuel consumption, in automatic mode, compared to a traditional automatic gearbox or even a traditional manual gearbox, - it offers real driving enjoyment gained from the possibility of choosing the gear change mode at any time - manual or automatic - with the gear lever or via controls behind the steering wheel.
it also enables the hdi diesel engine to be restarted instantly, “transparently” for the driver, when necessary.
to obtain this level of performance it uses the latest generation eccs ( extreme conventional combustion system) combustion chamber design, a variable-geometry low-inertia turbocharger, a high-pressure injection pump allowing a maximum pressure of 2000 bar in the common rail and solenoid injectors with eight apertures.
an inverter and a converter are used to control the electric power.
lastly, a latest-generation satellite navigation system helps to guide users on their travels.
the originality of this design helps visually to seat the rear of the vehicle.
in the medium term, this battery technology remains the most appropriate in terms of cost and industrialisation for vehicles produced in large volumes.
in the same perspective, a second-generationstop & start system is used.
in terms of road holding, this innovative power train is well served by the chassis, recognised for its dynamic qualities.
finally, multiple impressions emanate from the style of the car: tranquil strength, contained power, controlled dynamism… comfort: driving and sharing interior ambience:
changeover from the hdi diesel engine to the electric motor occurs automatically, thanks to astop & start system which places the hdi diesel engine in standby and restarts it as and when conditions require (accelerator pedal usage, low battery charge level, etc), - the two power sources also complement each other in certain driving conditions (“boost” effect during strong acceleration, when overtaking another vehicle, for example).
high-voltage battery pack the ni-mh (nickel metal hydride) batteries are located under the boot sill, near the electric motor.
peugeot connect services offered with wipcom 3d will also be accessible.
in this case, activation of the hdi diesel engine is programmed to coincide with more sustained phases of acceleration.
this results in smooth gear changes for optimum comfort.
at the front, peugeot’s stylistic codes have been adapted to the car’s generous dimensions to mark a break with what has gone before.
the “hybrid” power train basically combines a diesel engine and an electric motor.
since everything is controlled electronically (“by wire ”) with no mechanical link between the front and the rear, this system has many advantages over a “traditional” integral mechanical transmission system (with a prop shafts): - no architectural constraints affecting layout and style within the passenger compartment (interior capacity preserved); - 4x4 and environmental-friendliness are no longer contradicting terms.
the large front grille helps to define the vehicle’s status and off-road character, with its two distinctive chrome bars it is reminiscent of those found in the world of the suv.
this results in smooth gear changes for optimum comfort.
in this mode, the notion of “controlled power” comes into its own: coupling of the diesel engine with the electric motor provides more dynamic performance, optimally distributed and transmitted to the road by the four wheel drive for a level of stability and driveability that will appeal to all motoring enthusiasts.
the headlamps display a renewed expressiveness, with the integration of a bar of leds providing a daytime lighting function and accentuating the car’s visual appeal.
the electric motor and its ancillary equipment (inverter, converter, etc) are fitted at the rear of the vehicle.
it enhances this technological ambience in the same way as the 7’’ colour display which provides information on the energy flows.
it also enables the hdi diesel engine to be restarted instantly, “transparently” for the driver, when necessary.
peugeot connect services offered with wipcom 3d will also be accessible.
in terms of “vehicle dynamics”, the esp of the 3008 hybrid4 incorporates an “improved traction control system” (asr) able to exploit the car’s four wheel drive capabilities to the full on challenging surfaces.
this results in a number of advantages not only in terms of customer benefits but also from the standpoint of the project’s economic and industrial model.
this requires the high-voltage batteries to be sufficiently charged.
the rear spoiler, two-tone with a high gloss black section, helps to differentiate the 3008 hybrid4 from other models in the range, as do the chrome badges which decorate the sides and rear of the car.
the hobby type lower tailgate opens to reveal a boot with a flat floor equipped with longitudinal securing rings that inspire quality and strength.
wipcom 3d includes all the benefits of the marque’s existing satellite navigation systems.
with their exceptional efficiency, hdi fap diesel engines - thermodynamically more efficient than a petrol engine and offering like-for-like fuel consumption of 30% less - are clearly the best internal combustion engine choice.
operation of the bmp6 is even more enjoyable with hybrid4 technology insofar as the rear electric motor becomes active during gear changes.
the headlamps display a renewed expressiveness, with the integration of a bar of leds providing a daytime lighting function and accentuating the car’s visual appeal.
the lower front panel further reinforces these off road aspirations, thanks in particular to the black quarter bumpers aligned with the headlamps.
this brings about significant gains in fuel consumption and emissions in urban conditions.
indeed, as well as the social benefit of a steep reduction in fuel consumption, the level of performance provided by this technology will delight even the most demanding customers in terms of road holding, responsiveness, driveability and peace of mind, regardless of road conditions, with the possibility of enjoying silent operation in town in all-electric mode.
at the rear rear suspension to ensure a dynamic performance on a par with the marque’s road holding standards over a very varied range of vehicles (mid-range mpvs, top of the range body shapes, etc), the rear electric module, transferable across several different platforms, comprises a multi-arm rear suspension within which are housed the electric motor and the reduction gearbox.
the 3008 hybrid4 thus offers a new and highly technological approach to motoring, combining renewed driving enjoyment with a very low level of co2 emissions.
indeed hybrid4 technology, at low speed, allows all-terrain capabilities equivalent to those of an suv: the driver will no longer be worried by the prospect of a muddy path or a snowbound uphill drive to the ski resort; - “sport” mode favours quicker gear changes at higher engine speeds than normal mode.
this recovery system enables the driver to use “free” energy and reduce fuel consumption accordingly.
this allows optimal driving with a mix of low fuel consumption and dynamic driveability, - “zev” mode (zero emission vehicle) provides access to an extensive all-electric mode.
from the side, the window surrounds are edged with chrome in the upper section.
based on the manufacturer’s technical specifications, bosch has provided its expertise with respect to the electric motor, the power electronics, the reversible high-voltage alternator (stt) and other systems managing the dialogue between these components and the braking and trajectory correction systems (abs and esp).
the large front grille helps to define the vehicle’s status and off-road character, with its two distinctive chrome bars it is reminiscent of those found in the world of the suv.
four wheel drive this original layout allows the possibility of four wheel drive: the hdi diesel engine under the bonnet drives the front wheels, while the electric motor (in the rear drive train) drives the rear wheels.
the maximum combined power output can then reach 147 kw (200 bhp) through the addition of 120 kw (163 bhp) from the 2.0 litre hdi fap diesel engine and the temporary peak of the electric motor (27 kw, or 37 bhp).
similarly, sanyo has provided its extensive knowledge in the field of ni-mh high-voltage batteries .
with a 3008 benefiting from hybrid4 technology, the aim is to appeal to customers who expect not only environmental-friendliness and technological sophistication, but also real driving enjoyment.
from the boot, a rear seat folding system, controlled by switches mounted on the load area side trims, allows the seats in the second row to be folded automatically, as if by magic.
