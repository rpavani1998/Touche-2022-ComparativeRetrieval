generally, the more fuel-efficient a vehicle is, the better it is from a global warming standpoint.
epa ghg score: while the diesel jetta might appear to be a global warming laggard based on the previous comparison, the epa ghg score puts these emissions into a broader context.
when comparing diesels and hybrids, consumers should just be aware that “performance” in the categories of air pollution, global warming pollution and oil dependence are not merely a function of the vehicle’s fuel economy, but rather also a function of its emissions control system and even of the fuel’s chemical makeup.
comparing the environmental performance of diesels and hybrids miles per gallon (mpg): the mpg ratings for the civic hybrid are about 13% better than the diesel jetta in highway driving (45 versus 40 mpg) and 38% better in city driving (40 versus 29).
air pollution: epa also provides a similar score for comparing vehicles based on air pollution emissions.
the ghg score ranks all vehicles on a scale of 1 to 10.
note, there are no diesel and hybrid models that allow for a pure apples-to-apples comparison on every major attribute; we chose these models for their popularity and market comparability.
air pollution: epa also provides a similar score for comparing vehicles based on air pollution emissions.
this characteristic of diesel fuel is why using a fuel economy comparison between gasoline and diesel vehicles to determine global warming benefits can be misleading.
while there are other secondary global warming pollution factors for autos, the pollution a vehicle puts into the atmosphere is largely proportional to the amount of fuel the vehicle burns.
if a diesel vehicle consumes 25 percent less fuel than a gasoline powered vehicle, for example, its global warming benefit would in reality only be about 15 percent better than the gasoline vehicle.
thus, from an oil security standpoint, merely examining the fuel economy of a diesel vehicle doesn’t capture the full picture.
according to the joint u.s. epa-doe website,www.fueleconomy.gov, approximately 13 percent more crude oil is required to produce a gallon of diesel fuel than to produce a gallon of gasoline.
conclusion environmentally speaking, today’s diesels are a significant improvement over their recent ancestors and can offer notable fuel economy improvements over conventional gasoline vehicles.
oil dependence: comparison of petroleum consumption estimates show that the diesel jetta consumes about 45 percent more petroleum than the civic hybrid.
on a full fuel cycle basis (that is, incorporating not only the emissions at the vehicle itself, but also the emissions related to the extraction, refining and transporting of the fuel from wellhead to pump), the burning of diesel fuel emits roughly 13 percent more co2 per gallon of fuel burned than does burning a gallon of gasoline.

comparing the global warming emissions per mile, or carbon footprint, allows a direct comparison between two vehicles, while the epa greenhouse gas score shows how a vehicle relates to the rest of the fleet.
both the diesel jetta and civic hybrid are top scorers when compared to all other available vehicles in the showroom.

according to the joint u.s. epa-doe website,www.fueleconomy.gov, approximately 13 percent more crude oil is required to produce a gallon of diesel fuel than to produce a gallon of gasoline.
this reflects the benefits of hybridization in city driving and the strong fuel economy performance of diesel engines at sustained highway speeds.
epa-doe website www.fueleconomy.gov includes annual carbon footprint estimates, as well as annual crude oil consumption estimates and air pollution scores for every make and model on its site, allowing you to compare gasoline, diesel, and hybrid-electric vehicles side by side.
like some of their hybrid counterparts they also offer impressive fuel economy compared to many conventional vehicles on the road.
diesel fuel, in addition to containing more energy per gallon than gasoline, also has comparably higher carbon content.
global warming pollution: the mpg values help you determine how far you can go on a gallon of fuel, but more information is needed to accurately determine the global warming impact of a vehicle.
let’s dig in… under the hood: diesel fuel economy one of the biggest draws of diesel technology is their impressive fuel economy.
it should be noted that a vehicle’s fuel economy is highly dependent on manufacturers design decisions.

while diesels offer impressive fuel economy and have made improvements to their smog-forming emissions performance, efficient hybrids offer comparable (if not better) fuel economy, while still besting diesels on both the smog and global warming pollution fronts.

different fuels have unique concentrations of carbon, in a similar way that, say, different types of soda contain different amounts of sugar.
as we’ll see shortly, however, the impressive fuel economy numbers of diesels don’t tell the whole story when it comes to assessing other attributes such as global warming, or oil dependence performance, or air pollution.
it should be noted that a vehicle’s fuel economy is highly dependent on manufacturers design decisions.
however, the exceedingly impressive tailpipe emissions and fuel economy performance of today’s most popular hybrids allow them to outperform their diesel counterparts.
oil dependence: comparison of petroleum consumption estimates show that the diesel jetta consumes about 45 percent more petroleum than the civic hybrid.
the carbon footprint provides an estimate of the annual greenhouse gas pollution, measure in carbon dioxide equivalents (co2-equivalent), from each vehicle model based on both the energy efficiency of the vehicle, the carbon content of the fuel being used, and driving 15,000 miles annually.

meeting the “bin 5” standard is a significant achievement for diesels which, because of the diesel combustion process, produces high levels of nox and pm in the engine cylinders.

for example, the diesel jetta could have a better mpg, but the vehicle designers chose to achieve higher acceleration rather than better fuel economy.
overall, the hybrid civic (42 mpg) out-performs the diesel jetta (33 mpg) in combined city and highway fuel economy by 27 percent.
the civic hybrid emits an estimated 4.4 tons of co2-equivalent per year, while the jetta releases 6.4 tons per year, or approximately 45 percent more global warming emissions.

first, the compression ignition combustion process that occurs inside diesel engine cylinders is more efficient than the spark ignition process that occurs in gasoline engine cylinders, wasting less energy as the fuel is converted into mechanical motion.
using our previous example, a diesel vehicle that consumes 25 percent less fuel than a gasoline-powered vehicle would, in fact, consume only 15 percent less crude oil than the gasoline vehicle.

while this is a good general rule, it is important to note that using fuel economies to compare the global warming performance of two vehicles is only applicable when the two vehicles operate on the same fuel.
