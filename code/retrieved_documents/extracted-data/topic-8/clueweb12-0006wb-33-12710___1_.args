the way we assign data to feedname depends on whether we are using php or cgi as the intermediary.in addition to receiving the user data, we need to define a variable to hold the data.on the next page, we will look atthe php version of this setup and see how we can code the program to allow command-line execution and debugging.if we use cgi, we will need to import the cgi and cgitb libraries, enablecgitb, and then assign the data from cgi.if you are at all uncomfortable with the cgi library, i encourage you to read [link url=/od/cgiformswithpython/ss/pycgitut1.htm] my tutorial on programming cgi with python.if cgi is used for this program, the application should have a 'cgi' suffix instead of the usual 'py'.previous next - this is not the beginning - the python bang line - the tasks this python program must do - holding the user data in python with cgi - holding the user data in python with php - defining the first python function - reading the rss feed as a python file object - using a python iterator - calling python's function, retrieving the feed address related articles - part 2: getting feed information from the data file with python - rssreader.cgi - python cgi for an rss reader - python cgi - programming cgi with python - how to program cgi in python - installing a guestbook - build your own - using forms and cgi explore python must reads most popular - what is python?previous this is not the beginning the python bang line the tasks this python program must do holding the user data in python with cgi holding the user data in python with php defining the first python function reading the rss feed as a python file object using a python iterator calling python's function, retrieving the feed address next part 2: getting feed information from the data file with python rssreader.cgi - python cgi for an rss reader python cgi - programming cgi with python - how to program cgi in python installing a guestbook - buildfieldstorage to a dictionary from which we will cull the feedname by its html name value, 'selection'.
