those languages are needed in the vast majority of programming jobs, so people who see coding as a means to a paycheck rather than a passion will (quite reasonably) learn one of them and work in it.these tools pulled in website visitors, increased visibility of hubspot, and helped us get some interesting data that we used to benefit our core business.these tools pulled in website visitors, increased visibility of hubspot, and helped us get some interesting data that we used to benefit our core business.it is a personal choice based on the qualities of a language that appeal to you (verbosity and strong typing in my case) and that work for you in terms of your own productivity.although it’s perfectly possible to write good code in php, it’s much easier to write great code in python .if the product can grow, the language is scalable, talent is available in wide swaths of the community, and there is robust third party development (frameworks, open source, cms, etc) then i would say go with what you know best.i'm not a programmer myself, but do dabble in it sometimes and the idea that php have lots of open source and freely available code, makes you want to go back to it again and again.any experienced developer that can create great software can likely also write really good software in php.any experienced developer that can create great software can likely also write really good software in php.yes, it’s nice to know that there are thousands of hosting providers out there that all support php, and that you can get hosting really cheap as a result.in fact, many of the biggest open source projects out there, that you might consider leveraging, are based on php.yes, php sometimes probably involves a bit more programming *sometimes*, but i find that the python programmer is one who is a)lazy and b)enjoys coming up with impossible to track down code using highly ingenious solutions to solve the most menial problems ever.however, the more i work in python it appears the maintainability of a python application will be much easier.they won't apply for a job at a company using python because it would be a waste of time for them to invest in learning the language.other costs, as you mentioned, are minimal compared with the cost of learning new languages and frameworks for a single founder.
