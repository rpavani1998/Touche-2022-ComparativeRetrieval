wrapping up between the acid and javascript testing and our real world usage tests, we can say without a doubt that we would recommend virtually any of these browsers other than internet explorer.
internet explorer really dragged in these tests: several times  during the tests, an error box popped up asking to stop running them as they  were making the application run slowly.
it consistently came in last place for each of the tests and was by far the worst performing browser in the acid3 test.
dromaeo offers several sets of tests and  we opted for the full range, which takes over a half hour to run.

even though  firefox didn’t make it to 100 and chrome had failed the  ‘linktest,’ these browsers at least seemed to run the test in the  same amount of time as safari.
just as in the tests,  ie is tangibly slower in common use and sometimes creates problems with viewing  sites as they were intended.

acid2 is designed to expose browsers and  applications that inaccurately render simpler web content, particularly tests  for w3c html and css compliance that should be common on the web.
firefox was perpetually middling and came in third place in half of the tests while reaching second place the other half, never completely winning any one test.
as seen with dromaeo  and firefox, there was no home field advantage for safari.
if we were to give report cards as a result of the test, safari would earn the top mark of an a+ while chrome and firefox would each receive an a. internet explorer, though, clearly earned an f. speed testing with javascript many major web properties rely on javascript to accurately render the user environment.
upon allowing the add-on to load and re-running the test it  progressed to 20/100, but still failed.
surprisingly, firefox was in a distant third place, and the results for internet explorer barely registered.
because of its prevalence in modern web-browsing, our speed tests focused on  the browsers' ability to quickly render javascript code.
we  didn’t design this article to bash against microsoft, but their product  truly is second class compared to the competition.
either  is very lightweight and has an extremely simple user interface that gets out of  the way when possible.
this is especially true given the rapid shift in market share from internet explorer's one-time dominance: according to statcounter, internet explorer currently commands just 61 percent of the browser market, while firefox has climbed to second place with 30 percent market share and the last 9 percent shared between chrome, opera, safari and smaller rivals.
it builds upon acid2 and stresses compliance with the dom (document object model) and javascript, the latter of which is crucial to most modern web apps like google docs.
the results  for this test are expressed in the number of test runs per second, so the  higher the score the better.
firefox, safari, and chrome all came in  at around 2,000 milliseconds, but chrome just barely claimed the win while  internet explorer took over 8,000 milliseconds to finish.
because of its prevalence in modern web-browsing, our speed tests focused on the browsers' ability to quickly render javascript code.
the bad - internet explorer uniformly bad in all tests.
all testing was done under actual usage scenarios with other applications running in the background.
the first time ie ran acid3, it stated that it needed to run an add-on called msxml 3.0 and it made it to 12/100 with some random graphical errors.
chrome and firefox produced very similar results but reached second and third places respectively.
we can honestly say weve never seen a software application all but beg to stop a test.

chrome did in fact win this test, but safari took a close second.
it's interesting to note  the internet explorer generated the most consistent sample of scores at 1.5  percent variance or less and chrome and safari generated the most scattered  scores, at around 4 percent variance.
other browsers completed the tests, but the gaps were wide: firefox appropriately edged out chrome by about 30 points, but safari took the crown and more than doubled firefoxs score.

all four  browsers passed the acid2 test with no issues, errors, or delays, though it was  originally launched in 2005 and has been used as a target for accuracy even by  microsoft, which until recent years had not felt compelled to fully support w3c. acid3, however, was a 2008 update to acid2 and was considerably more  of a challenge for our four contestants.
they may have garnered less than 5 percent of the global browser market, but they're both excellent browsers that deserve more.
acid2 is designed to expose browsers and applications that inaccurately render simpler web content, particularly tests for w3c html and css compliance that should be common on the web.
google of course uses the v8 javascript engine in chrome, so we anticipated a slanted result here as well.
personal usage thoughts while not the champion, the new firefox 3.5 is still noticeably faster in daily browsing than the previous 3.1 edition.
again, the results are measured in milliseconds, so the lower the score the better.
these tests verify that browsers  are compliant with major web standards including w3c, html 4.0, xml 1.0, xhtml  1.1, and dom and ecma standards.
what left little mystery was internet explorer's habitual lack of performance.
firefox came close at 93/100; chrome, which also uses a modern  webkit engine, matched apple at 100/100 but unusually produced an error stating  that the "linktest failed.
we tried running smaller sets of  tests, but each batch resulted in at least one error that prevented internet  explorer from completing the run.
firefox was perpetually  middling and came in third place in half of the tests while reaching second  place the other half, never completely winning any one test.
all of our testing was conducted on anotebook connected to a wi-fi network to simulate real world usage.

- firefox best with add-ons.
this can  largely be pinned on safari's nitro engine, which is touted as better optimized  than chrome's and also has the advantage of the fairly lean webkit rendering  engine to back it up.

if you havent tried one of these browsers before, we would highly recommend giving one or both of them a go for a solid week -- though mac users will likely have already spent their fair share of time with apple's software, which can't be said for windows users and chrome.

with the latest versions of apples safari and mozillas firefox recently released, it became time for a browser comparison to test whether or not improvements in standards and raw speed have made a difference.

there are no redeeming qualities to the software's performance or ability  to draw websites, and it's bad enough that we would recommend any other browser  over internet explorer unless it's absolutely required.
