and there are few games and no children's or educational software of any description available for linux, for example (although some dos and ms windows software can be run under the linux dos and windows emulators).
if this ploy were to fail, microsoft could kill off most competing operating systems simply by buying them up.
together with supporting utilities and tools from the gnu free software foundation, the end result was a fully fledged unix-like operating system which he dubbed linux (linus's unix).

some versions are intended for typical office use while others are more suited to programmers but the important thing is that you can always add software and utilities to make your system do what you want it to do.
having the source code allows you to compile your own kernel just the way you want it, or to suit the needs of your hardware or application.
i want to get things done with my computers and i want to trust and rely on them - and that simply means a 100% reliable operating system: linux is that operating system.
it has all the facilities, features and tools you would expect of a commercial unix and some significant plus points - it will run on ordinary low-cost pcs, software for linux is mostly free and commercial software is inexpensive, support is excellent and ongoing
now that most pcs have cd-rom drives, increasingly popular are the linux cd-rom distribtions and these are a great way to get linux.
given the chance, microsoft will kill off all other operating systems - including linux.

it has all the facilities, features and tools you would expect of a commercial unix and some significant plus points - it will run on ordinary low-cost pcs, software for linux is mostly free and commercial software is inexpensive, support is excellent and ongoing development is certainly dynamic!
on its own, the linux kernel can't be used for very much - it's a bit like having ms-dos but without the command.com shell and all the utilities such as attrib, scandisk, format and so on, that make it do something useful.
commercial vendors may make a small charge for distributing it (eg, on cd-rom media for example) but they must comply with the terms of the gpl.
cd-rom installation is the best way to go - it's fast and very professional install programs are now included on the disk.
microsoft is here to stay and so is linux and rather than one camp slagging off the other, maybe we should just accept the two operating systems can co-exist quite happily - windows nt4 and linux in many ways integrate well.
hat has a very polished and painless install procedure from its cd-rom (i use red hat linux version 5.1 on my dell laptop) and so does s.u.
microsoft is not to be trusted.
forabout £2 plus postage you get a cd-rom packed with 500-600 mbytes of linux executables, kernels, software and documentation; the charge just covers the cost of the cd media.

pcs using the intel 386 cpu and upwards, digital alphas, macintoshes, sun sparcs, ataris, amigas and even the 3com palm pilot, although it is probably true to say most linux systems are based on intel pcs, as this is the cheapest and most popular computer system around.
but it is important the computer user has a choice - how dull and boring it would be if all we had were microsoft operating systems; no mac os, no vms, no as400, no flavours of unix, no atari tos, no amigados.

source code is always available - you'll never get this with commercial unix implementations costing thousands of pounds, never mind anything from microsoft!.
incidentally, buying a cd-rom can work out cheaper than your dial-up phone bills if your internet connection is via modem.
i have never known linux itself crash, although x-servers occasionally hang if they are abused.
i want to get things done with my computers and i want to trust and rely on them - and that simply means a 100% reliable operating system: linux is that operating system.
if you've got a network connection at work, university or whatever, this is the cheapest way of getting linux - it costs you absolutely nothing except for some space on your hard disk or maybe a box of floppies!
very similar to unix, it can run on a number of different platforms - ibm-compatible pcs using the intel 386 cpu and upwards, digital alphas, macintoshes, sun sparcs, ataris, amigas and even the 3com palm pilot, although it is probably true to say most linux systems are based on intel pcs, as this is the cheapest and most popular computer system around.
but let no-one be deluded - microsoft's ultimate goal is total world domination in both operating systems and applications software, both on the desktop and in the corporate server market, making serious inroads into territory previously the sole preserve of mainframes and unix.
together with a typical range of application packages (which require huge amounts of disk space), windows also costs a lot of money.
linux users know they are using something far better than windows and they just get on with enjoying it!

cd-rom installation is the best way to go - it's fast and very professional install programs are now included on the disk.
if you want a printed manual, multiple cd-rom sets in jewel cases, then you can pay anything from £20 to £50 but it still represents incredibly good value compared with what you get from 'you-know-who'.
development is driven by the needs of its own users, not some marketing department seeking fresh sources of revenue.

ok, the range and variety of applications software available for the linux operating system is nowhere near as broad as that for microsoft windows but as more and more serious computer users are turning to linux, the number of packages is increasing.
the current generation of operating systems from microsoft demand ever faster pentium cpus, lots of ram and increasing amounts of hard disk space; linux will run well on an old 386 box even with x-windows - imagine what it can do when it runs on a 500mhz pentium iii pc, or even better, a 700mhz dec alpha axp system ...!

microsoft windows is relatively slow, unstable, is much less well-documented at a technical level and is such a mess internally that ms daren't fix the bugs for fear of either introducing more bugs or preventing existing applications that have been written around the bugs from working properly.
microsoft is not to be trusted.
distributions vary in what they offer, in the range of software provided and in the ease of installation but all will give you a fully-functional linux system when installed.
i have never known linux itself crash, although x-servers occasionally hang if they are abused.
also, if you have a computer that has neither a cd-rom drive nor an internet connection, a floppy installation is the only way to get linux onto the system.
it is the thin edge of the wedge - next, browsers are becoming part of ms windows and, left unchecked, microsoft will then begin creating its own standards and foisting them onto the internet community, creating a different kind of network that will slowly but inexorably squeeze out other operating systems.
in the same way there will always be people who are quite happy with a ford mondeo or vauxhall cavalier, rather than something a bit classier.

and now dell, hewlett-packard and even ibm have seen the light and are actively supporting linux by investing in linux distribution vendors, offering it as a factory-installed alternative to microsoft winodws and providing support for linux in the corporate workplace.
the day when you can go out and buy shrink-wrapped software for linux off the shelf at the local branch of w h smith, take it home and install it like a windows program is still some way off.
well, it's all there for the asking on the 'net - usenet newsgroups, informative web pages, ftp sites galore, completelinux cd's for £2.00 ....

it is fast & efficient - equalling and in many cases exceeding the performance of other unixes such as solaris.
here microsoft must tread carefully - seeking to dominate the world software arena will lead to an ever dwindling variety as this giant sucks up all before it.
now that most pcs have cd-rom drives, increasingly popular are the linux cd-rom distribtions and these are a great way to get linux.
this will never happen to linux - it is owned by a community, not a company or software house, and there is no way anyone (no, not even microsoft) can stifle it by buying it.
it is probably correct to say the amount of software available for linux is fast catching up with that for the macintosh.
