the linux community will talk about the free or low-cost nature  of linux.
one could also argue that window - even nt - was not designed for  multi-user environments and the the need to protect users - and programs - from  each other.
the number of applications does not matter - it's whether the particular applications needed by the user are available that makes a difference.
given the pace of development in the linux world, microsoft's document  will be obsolete very soon.
linux as a desktop operating system makes no sense.
access  control lists (acls) are also in development and in a testing mode.
given the pace of development in the linux world, microsoft's document will be obsolete very soon.
a look at microsoft's 'linux myths' this week microsoft took the gloves off and put up this page about  "the five linux myths."
shortly linux will have three such file systems, however.
this is the nt that isyears late?
this seems a  little strange, given the large number of high profile, linux-based web sites  out there.
delivering a scalable system is a complex task and it's not clear that the linux community can solve these issues easily or quickly.2.2 delivered quite a few improvements; 2.4 will deliver quite a few more.
a user would  end up with a system that has fewer applications, is more complex to use and  manage, and is less intuitive.
many users find a linux desktop to  be most sensible, and many more will with each new release of the system.
nonetheless, it is important.
microsoft also claims that linux high-availability and clustering are "immature," which has a certain basis in truth.
linux lacks a commercial quality journaling file system.
it points at places where work needs to be done.
administrators cannot delegate administrative privileges: a user who needs any administrative capability must be made a full administrator, which compromises best security practices.
linux security is all-or-nothing.
we also humbly suggest the lwn security page as a central place to look to  keep up on security issues.
therefore, commercial support services for linux will be fee-based and will likely be priced at a premium....as opposed to the wonderful free support services for windows nt...
asynchronous i/o is being worked on, and can also be done now via threads - there is disagreement over whether other approaches such as completion ports truly provide better performance.
for some  users, linux will make a better desktop, for others it "makes no  sense."
it's important to understand that licensing cost is only a small part of the overall decision-making process for customers.
there is some truth here.
the largest file size linux supports is 2 gb versus 16 terabytes (tb) for windows nt 4.0.
they also fail to note that a number of the performance  problems found then have since been fixed.
they must sign up for their distribution's security announcement list, and apply the updated packages when they are released.
this is made complex due to the fact that there isn't a central location for security issues to be reported and fixed.
the linux community continues to promise major smp and  performance improvements.
microsoft, of course, completely avoids the issue of freedom, since they  have no answer to that one.
the  number of applications does not matter - it's whether the particular  applications needed by the user are available that makes a difference.
the linux kernel has increasing support  for capabilities, which provide the sort of fine-grained privileges needed, but  support for capabilities at the user level will be a while in coming.
for some users, linux will make a better desktop, for others it "makes no sense."
they cite the june pc week benchmarks which did indeed show nt  performing better.
the document makes a number of points, some of which are better than  others.
this is certainly not the last that we will hear from them.
in addition, linux does not support many of the  modern operating system features that windows nt 4.0 has pioneered such as  asynchronous i/o, completion ports, and fine-grained kernel locks.
it would appear that the long-awaited microsoft counteroffensive has begun.
the file size limit  is real (on 32-bit systems), and is a bit of a thorny problem - the 2.4 kernel  will not fix it.
microsoft also claims that linux high-availability and clustering are  "immature," which has a certain basis in truth.
the time gets significant when there are large numbers  of systems to update, but that is true of nt "service packs" as well.
...as opposed to the  wonderful free support services for windows nt... linux is a higher risk option than windows nt.
let's look at a few of them.
many users find a linux desktop to be most sensible, and many more will with each new release of the system.
on performance: the linux community claims to have improved performance and  scalability in the latest versions of the linux kernel (2.2), however it's  clear that linux remains inferior to the windows nt® 4.0 operating system.
the linux swap file is limited to 128 mb ram.
there is little here that is not well on the way toward being  solved.
the linux community likes to talk about linux as a stable and reliable operating system, yet there is no real world data or metrics and very limited customer evidence to back up these claims.

the "superuser" model has a  number of problems, and utilities like "sudo" are a sort of fragile  kludge made necessary by this model.
the document makes a number of points, some of which are better than others.
all systems are vulnerable to security issues, however it's important to note that linux uses the same security model as the original unix implementations- a model that was not designed from the ground up to be secure.
microsoft's claims of lower cost of ownership  for nt fly in the face of the experience of large numbers of system and network  administrators.
the linux community will talk about the free or low-cost nature of linux.
for now it is true that mainstream linux contains some  performance problems.
linux clustering is  also highly successful in many situations.

the linux swap  file is limited to 128 mb ram.
microsoft makes no mention of the difference in turnaround times - linux bugs are fixed much more quickly.
the swap file limit claim is simply false as of 2.2.0 (and even with previous versions one could use multiple swap files).
