as (again, i believe, but may be wrong) all the hardware is designed by apple, it all just 'works' together much better, whereas with a pc, the mainboard may be from one company, graphics card another... soundcard a different one still, etc... not necessarily all totally compatible).
after all, no one knows everything and you may have the answer that someone needs.
the biggest problem is the soft of course, what can you say when there is even no decent file manager for mac (i mean like total commander), finder just beats the £%$ out of me whats good about mac is that when you buy one, you buy a computer that works, you dont have to worry about anything.

it's a good platform for development and designing as well, yet the pc is no worse i think..
7- ultimate pc's are much better, esspecially security wise i have used both windows pc's, and mac's in the past and found that even a free antivirus installed on a windows pc is better than a mac os, even with their own security systems.
if you use linux at all, the command line stuff on mac is very similar, due to being unix based (i believe, although tech guys, correct me if i am wrong!)
i am a hard core pc fan, so i would tell you everything thats wrong with a mac but since your not a gamer, thats a different story.
another reason for few mac posts might be because of the percentage of ms windows computers in use compared to macs.
it might be that mac users would be more likely to go to centres of knowledge that are geared to them.

once you get used to them, they work really well, less clunky than many pcs *
this is from past incidents that have happen to me or friends of mine.

pc experience: pc guru operating system: windows 7- home premium i currently use both, windows and apple for my work and i must say i really am swaying towards the mac, its a very simple interface thats easy to grasp the mac touch pad is genuis and works fantastic for me in cs5 and things just work, say plug in my canon photo printer, no disc just plug it in apple auto found all needed drivers and installed them so by the time i was read to print my first page it had all self installed and was work a treat!

where windows and any security systems mainly built for windows uses md5 signature identification.
most of us here may not have the large knowledge-base that exists on dedicated mac forums.
this means the identifying, and deleting of the viruses is 100% effective and 120% more effective than a mac's security.
not alot of programs work on it and your can't upgrade most macs if the need comes up.
macs until a few years ago were very hard to get help with and software too, but as people have stated it is getting better.
i think it be cool to have both a pc and a mac pc experience: very experienced operating system: xp home-windows 7 home premium tootech i deleted your post because i deleted the sollynaljesony post for adding spam.
that could be a reason why mac users wouldn't post here.

took perhaps 6 to 8 weeks to get used to my mac, course i don't know it a well as i did windows, but i don't need to.
