so i think that's enough for comparing these two if you are a developer then laptop will be pretty frustrating to work with.
i rarely use my laptop, only if i'm not at home.
i guess it's partly true because almost everyone i know uses a laptop instead of a proper desktop pc.
however, many are not aware of the health hazards that using a laptop presents.
but i still find them more useful for email and internet surfing.
however, laptops are great when i travel (when i pretend i'm doing work, when i'm actually watching a film =p) i do find that when i'm working or watching a film, after a while my back/neck just starts to ache.
in fact it would be wrong to refer to some of them as "laptops" - a few of my friends have ones with massive 17" screens and weigh over 9 lbs.
using them placed on your lap for even half an hour would fry your private parts and might stop the blood circulation on your legs as well.
(of course, as head of it, i have 6 computers, both pcs and macs, running windows, os/x and linux - but my laptop is still my main comp).
if i'm working, i prefer to work on a desktop.
the other thing is, you can get a really nice beefed up desktop for very little money.
laptop of course, is ceap, portable, and i love it...
i must be old fashioned because i choose the desktop.
the small screens (in majority) and tiny closely set keyboards are not exactly ergonomic either.
i will always prefer desktops because they are so much easier to upgrade and parts are cheaper for them then laptops.
laptop don't have good graphic card.
however, for sheer practicality, i will say i prefer laptops.
but i would definitely buy a desktop for a wider flat screen monitor and for speed .i think both are complimentary and can't outdo much .
it's worked well for me.
if i am working with dreamweaver, photoshop and other programs running, i'll take my loaded desktop thanks.
as you say we use them sitting and lying in awkward positions.
due to it's portability, a lot of people work with a laptop in awkward positions - lying on the bed, hunched over it on a park bench and so on.
i cannot play a game that need fast graphic card in my laptop.
it's quite affordable to have a lappie with 3gb or 4gb ram, which translates to a speedy performer.
both desktop and laptop have different function.
personally i prefer my my extremely fast desktop pc, with the ergonomic microsoft keyboard and wide 22" flat screen monitor.
in the office, however, there are desktop machines for everyone, and those that travel a lot have laptops as well.
i guess the main reason is that they are so handy - they take up little space and are portable.
if you'll be using it in the same place 85% of the time or more, i'd say get a nice desktop and a cheap and/or refurbished laptop that you'll use just on occasion and traveling.
i guess the only disadvantage is that i cannot lug it around with me all the time but then neither do most of my friends using a laptop.
the graphics cards in the laptops now are sufficient for gaming as well, so i am not lacking at all.
i prefer pc over laptop as i like wide screens which laptops cant provide it sucks, because i really like laptops, but your arguments are 100% on, which is why i rarely if ever use mine (and why i got it cheap, just for travel in the first place).
i would like a laptop eventually, when i have the money because it would mean i could watch tv and surf the net.
moreover, ram nowadays is cheap.
you can screw you wrist, shoulders and back up at a desktop bad enough.
laptop is good for professionals while desktop is better for students and medium person being of cheaper accessories.
using them like that for hours together is bound to show in increased back and neck stress.
most notebook users have no idea what they're doing to themselves.
