tcl/tk script which allows setting the acpi cpu performance state using a graphical interface under linux.
the ps/2 port does not currently support sharing.
they often use specialized hardware, hence finding a driver can be more difficult.
they use certain hardware such as pcmcia cards, infrared and bluetooth ports, wireless lan, lcd displays, batteries, docking stations.
the main problem is that is a bit difficult to set up, and if you're going wrong with the commandssvgatextmode or restoretextmode some results on thelcd might be frightening.
as mentioned in the introduction laptops sometimes have less resources if you compare them to desktops.
ibam (intelligent battery monitor) is an advanced battery monitor for laptops, which uses statistical and adaptive linear methods to provide accurate estimations of minutes of battery left or of the time needed until full recharge.
from the mobile-update page (modified by wh): discharge the battery.
they may even declare the warranty void.
the kernel can be configured with "yes" to "apm support" and "enable console blanking using apm" (section "general setup").
put the mount points into /etc/fstab but use the "noauto" flag to prevent them from being mounted automatically with themount -a flag.
it is modified to read battery status information using the new acpi kernel module, making it much more accurate and reliable than the old apm method.
if none of the above helps, you may try to run a start-up-script, which has to run at the end of the boot process.
in x mode, the same effect can be obtained with "xset +dpms" (enable dpms function) and "xset s blank" (enable screen blanking).
plug in a usb mouse and check that your mouse has been correctly sensed by the kernel.
reboot the system and install the rest of the distribution, you may now use all the advanced features such aspcmcia, ppp and others.
