compared to children up to 12 years of age, adolescents (13–20 years) suffered more injuries and adults (>20 years) fewer injuries.
an α level of 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
the overall injury risk was increased among  beginners (or 2.72; 2.12 to 3.47), children (or 1.72; 1.41 to 2.13),  adolescents (or 2.16; 1.72 to 2.66) and non-nordic skiers (or 1.80; 1.37 to  2.36).
the target number  interviewed corresponded to the expected injury count from each resort,  estimated from injury surveillance data from the previous years.3 the  interviews were conducted at the entry of the bottom main ski lift at each  resort.
this is when most users enter the area, and the main lifts  serve to feed a number of other lifts, which take the skiers further into the  mountain area to ski the runs available.
as a control group, uninjured skiers and snowboarders were interviewed in  the same eight ski resorts during the same season (n=2992).
adjusted  for other factors, telemark skiers had a 70% higher risk for shoulder injuries  compared to snowboarders, while there was no significant difference between  snowboarders and alpine skiers.
the results from a crude and adjusted logistic regression analysis of the  relationship between any injury and the potential risk factors are shown in table 2.

the authors found that alpine skiers had about 2.5 times the risk  of snowboarders and telemark skiers.
snowboarders had a higher overall injury risk than skiers (or 2.11; 1.81  to 2.46).
previous section next section discussion
according to the authors' definition, an injury is whatever was reported to and  registered by the ski patrol.
beginners were at a higher risk of injuries compared to the intermediate, good and expert skiers (or ranging from 2.12 to 3.47), and non-nordic skiers were at a higher risk than the nordic skiers (or 1.37 to 2.36).
view this table: in a new window table 4 distribution of injured body region related to skiing equipment (n=3170).
in the present study, the authors found that  snowboarders had twice the overall injury risk of alpine and telemark skiers,  and a three times higher risk for potentially severe injuries.
in this study, the proportion of shoulder injuries was highest among  telemark skiers (20%) compared to alpine and snowboarders (11% each).
crude analyses of injury risk concerning lower leg fractures, knee injuries  and shoulder injuries did not differ more than 15% from the adjusted analyses,  thus there is a low degree of confounding.
the results  of these studies showed that injury risk factors were quite consistent between  less and potentially more severe cases, which means that a reporting bias was  unlikely.
data showed that children younger  than 13 years had a four times higher risk than adolescents, and 11 times  higher risk than adults.
objective to determine the risk factors among skiers and snowboarders.
previous section next section ski patrols at eight major norwegian ski resorts registered injuries during the 2002 winter season (geilo, hafjell, trysil, norefjell, hovden, oppdal, hemsedal and ålsheia).
such patients were  defined as potentially severe cases.
a standard form was used to record personal data (age, gender, nationality), as well as information on the type of equipment (alpine skis, telemark skis (which permit a turning technique with free heel lift), snowboard, sleigh or other), use of helmet (yes/no), previous ski school attendance (yes/no), rented or own equipment (yes/no) and skiing ability.
injury  as a result of collision was seen more frequently among the alpine skiers  (15.6%) than in the other disciplines (9.5%).
for knee injuries (table 6), the authors found the highest risk among  females, beginners, alpine skiers and non-nordic skiers/boarders.
to study the relationships between potential risk factors and injury, the  authors chose a multiple logistic regression model with injury as the dependent  variable, and equipment, age, gender, ability, nationality, used rented  equipment, attended skiing instruction and helmet use as the adjustment  factors.
the idea that beginners are  at higher risk, is well established in the literature, but the risk estimates  have been inconsistent, varying from 1.6 to 7 times higher risk.9,–,11 13  14 whether the female skiers and snowboarders have the same injury risk and  distribution as the men is controversial.
skiing ability was classified into four categories (beginner, intermediate,  good or expert) based on self-reported performance of turns.12
however, during the 1990s, telemark skiing and, in particular, snowboarding gained popularity.3 the injury risk is high,2 and serious injuries are common in both skiers and snowboarders.4,–,6
for lower leg fractures (table 5), beginners had a risk 2.5 times higher,  compared to non-beginners, and children under 12 years had a risk four times  higher than in adolescents and eleven times than in adult skiers.
an uninjured control group (n=2992) was obtained at the same resorts.
the high lower leg fracture rate among children is an issue which  needs to be addressed, as release bindings alone do not seem to have solved the  problem in this age group.
langranet al7 found that tibia/fibula  fractures represented 5% of injuries to alpine skiers and 0.5% among  snowboarders.
although the authors do not know how a stressful injury situation may  have affected how skiers report their skiing ability or ski instruction, most  other factors could be observed directly by the ski patrol.
from a multiple logistic regression analysis of the relationship between the potentially severe injuries and controls, the authors detected that beginners (or 2.50, 2.08 to 3.33; p> don't forget to sign up for content alerts so you keep up to date with all the articles as they are published.
the authors also found that adults and children have a significantly higher  risk of shoulder injuries than adolescents.
in addition, the  ski patrol recorded whether the injury occurred in prepared runs, in the  snowboard park, off-piste (outside groomed runs), while taking the ski lift or  getting on/off.
recall bias is not likely to have been a significant factor, since  interviews were done on the spot, usually within a few minutes after the  injury.
thus, downhill winter sports injuries represent a significant concern.

age, nationality, skiing ability and the type of equipment were the  significant risk factors.
previous section next section limitations recent studies on the risk factors of skiing and snowboarding injury have  to some extent been inconclusive because they lack an appropriate control group  or the number of injuries has been too small for multivariate analyses.
the anatomical location (head, neck, shoulder, etc.) and injury type was recorded (classified as fracture, dislocation, sprain, contusion, skin wound or illness), as well as whether the patient needed transportation to a physician or hospital for further evaluation and treatment.
to study the relationships between potential risk factors and injury, the authors chose a multiple logistic regression model with injury as the dependent variable, and equipment, age, gender, ability, nationality, used rented equipment, attended skiing instruction and helmet use as the adjustment factors.

alpine skiers (or 2.65; 1.47 to 4.80), beginners (or 2.50; 1.61 to  3.85), children (or 11.1; 6.7 to 20.0) and adolescents (or 4.17; 2.44 to 7.14)  were prone to lower leg fractures.
nevertheless, lower leg fractures are still  common in young alpine skiers (17% of all injuries in alpine skiers up to 12  years old).
potential confounding  by type of run or weekday of injury may have been accounted for, at least in  part, by factors adjusted for in the analysis, for example, nationality, skiing  ability, rented equipment and skiing instruction.

however, the authors did  see a 67% higher risk for knee injuries among female skiers and snowboarders,  as well as a 46% lower risk for shoulder injuries and 32% lower risk for head  injuries.
the authors are indebted to the ski patrols at the various resorts for  recording injuries and interviewing the control group.

obtaining a control group representative of all  skiers and snowboarders at risk is another difficult task.
the results from a crude and adjusted logistic regression analysis of the relationship between any injury and the potential risk factors are shown in table 2.
rented equipment and skiing instruction did not seem to influence the  overall risk of injury, while skiing instruction decreased the risk of  potentially severe injuries.

the injury often occurs as a combination  of compressive loading and twisting of the knee.19 this mechanism is typical in  the alpine skiing discipline, when the skier loses balance or the ski edge  catches during a turn.20 21 upper limb and head injuries are often associated  with falling from a jump.22 23 thus, more cautious skiing may be an explanation  for why female skiers and snowboarders have a lower risk for upper limb and  head/neck injuries.
the injury pattern varied between the three  disciplines, snowboarding, alpine and telemark skiing, reflecting the inherent  differences in user technique and equipment design.
the study was based on anonymised data from the norwegian  ski lift association injury and marketing research databases, and ethical  approval was not required by the regional committee for medical research ethics.
in fact,  alpine skiers had more than twice the risk of knee injuries compared to  snowboarders, and also a significantly higher risk than telemark skiers.

sacco et al24 found that alpine skiers and snowboarders were  equally prone to injury in an evaluation of skiing and snowboarding injuries  admitted to the local level 1 trauma center over a 6-year period, but without  any control material their conclusion is difficult to interpret.
for patients with multiple injuries (less  than 1%), each injury was recorded as a separate case.
injury type and risk factors (age, gender, nationality, skill level, equipment, helmet use, ski school attendance, rented or own equipment) were recorded.
knee injuries occurred more frequently among alpine skiers (or 1.82; 1.39 to 2.38), females (or 1.67; 1.38 to 2.03) and beginners (or 3.13; 2.50 to 3.85).
some authors claim that the injury rate for shoulder injuries is quite  similar between disciplines,7 26,–,28 while others have found a much  higher incidence among snowboarders than alpine skiers.29 30 these conclusions  are mostly based on studies without control groups.
the adjusted ors were then compared with the crude ors, and the difference  did not exceed 20%.
in this study, the authors found a 19% lower  overall injury risk for female skiers and snowboarders in the crude analysis,  but this was not significant in the adjusted model.
