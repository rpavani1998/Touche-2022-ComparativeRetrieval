plus, the microgrocer model allowsin.gredients to easily open in more austin neighborhoods without displacing existing buildings or requiring excess surface parking that displaces livable space.
as the environment changes, so may the best choice.

and while iadore farmers’ markets, more often than not my schedule isn’t compatible with market days and times (unfortunately).
having lots of yummy fresh eggs is such a wonderful treat, but before you put up your coop, determine whether raising chickens is right for you.

fruits and veggies listed in “the dirty dozen” tend to be pretty “chemically” and are best to avoid when they aren’t available as organic.
the most important thing is to do a bit of research, and make your decision based on the facts.
last week the city of san francisco’s solid waste and recycling program,recology, collected its millionth ton of food scraps from household kitchens and businesses across the city.
the answer’s pretty complex, with many factors to consider…and it really depends on where you live, so answers will be different for people in different parts of the country.
but at some point in time, even if it’s 35 years later, that non-recyclable plastic will have to go to a landfill.
what’s more, in.gredients‘ future shoppers can find cool projects to work on by visiting the burlap bag’s blog - a great way to make use of the meanwhile beforein.gredients ‘ manor road storefront goes live!
however, if you’re not up for such a project, a well-timed trip to thrift store could win you a great tree and the satisfaction that it wont be seeing the landfill this year.
it will also never deviate from its path even if what it “chooses” doesn’t make sense given the bigger picture.
what’s more, i’ve found that even my favorite small, local grocery stores don’t have a great selection of local and organic produce.
it also doesn’t take any fossil fuel to go and grab the tree from the attic, so it’s definitely an energy-saver.
let me clarify – it’ll be easier to eat it because it’ll be easier to find it!
for some folks the fake tree will always be the better option because of geographic location, budget, and transportation among other reasons.
not all fake trees need be store-bought pvc saplings from china.
a little creativity and thinking out side the box could introduce some new and exciting holiday traditions!
what’s more, it’s a great way to use leftover roast chicken or turkey!
but the window of opportunity to get at these farm-fresh goodies will be significantly wider, so no fret if you can’t make it to market day.
you can decrease your likelihood of chowing down on pesticides by using the ewg’s shopper’s guide to pesticides in produce.
but if you have to go to the bathroom food may need to wait… that is, unless the house is on fire.
the most important thing is to do a bit of research, and make your decision based on the facts.

real trees contain no harmful chemicals, are 100% biodegradable, “locally-sourced” (local in this case is “grown in the us and canada”), and provide an added benefit of storing carbon while they are growing.
additionally, the carbon storage feature on real trees is great, but it’s counterproductive if trees are cut down.
you could do this by cutting down your own tree near your home, or asking the tree vendor which kind is the most “local.”
given this flow, the program will never consider if the house is on fire and will burn up.
you’re still limited by the behaviors you’ve learned, but are more free to choose which behavior best fits your current environment.
trees are pretty heavy, so this could demand a hefty amount of fossil fuel.

some fruits and vegetables carry with them more pesticide contamination than others.
if you’re hungry, go get food.
it’s easy to make, relatively quick, and makes a delicious warm meal for a winter day.
most are made of pvc plastic, so they aren’t recyclable.
the beauty of this recipe: if you live in central texas, you can get all the “fixins” for this salad locally, because as y’all know, ’tis the season for persimmons and pecans!
it also doesn’t take any fossil fuel to go and grab the tree from the attic, so it’s definitely an energy-saver.
as i’m an eco-friendly kind of gal, it’s been a personal goal of mine for some time to go local and organic, but it’s been tough going.
as the title of this post says, we’re a “grocery store in scope” and a “convenience store in scale” – meaning we’ll offer a broad selection of food (dairy, meat, produce, breads, household cleaners, …) in a dense, efficient space.
josiah and lauren lowe, the burlap bag’s founders, are all about sustainability – and their blog has some great ideas for preparing for sustainable living, including tutorials on how to make suchin.gredients-handy things as diy spice shakers, diy vegetable broth, and diy room air-freshener.
it’s hard to say “term a” is more important than “term b” because in the real world few things are so cut-and-dry.
once trees are dead they don’t use any co2, so they won’t be removing any more carbon from the air.
the store’s stocked with artisan crafts as well as locally-made creative gifts and home decor.
most of the time when we think of “specialty store” we think of a small store offering organic spices and nuts and herbs.
but at some point in time, even if it’s 35 years later, that non-recyclable plastic will have to go to a landfill.
where does it come from, what are the ethos of the producer and the rest of the supply chain, are there alternative options we can compare it to…and, like in behavioral programming, make a calculated decision based on the decisions unique environment and the variables within it.

you could give it to goodwill, the salvation army, or maybe put it on craigslist.
better yet, you could buy a living tree with roots intact and plant it post-christmas.

to get a program tobehave a particular way it has to be programmed to pick exactly the right path.
christmas trees, which are usually firs or pines, need to be hauled to parts of the country where these species don’t grow.

in fact, some of the farms with booths at central texas farmers’ markets are the ones whose produce we’ll be carrying.
in its classic model the computer was programmed to make a “choice” given a set of rules that are obeyed.

if anything changed, a program wasn’t equipped to adapt.
this is great if the computer is, for example, playing chess – it just needs to know the few million possible configurations, play out every game to the end in its head, and choose the move that means it’s most likely to win.
fake trees: benefits and drawbacks fake trees can last for decades, which is a great considering nothing is going to waste during its life-span.
the national christmas tree association (ncta) says that real trees, hands-down, are better for the environment.
for a fake tree, this could be tricky.
so naturally, i’m really excited about the fact that when in.gredients debuts, it’ll be like having a supplementary farmers’ market on call 7 days a week.
we’ll have between one and “a couple to a few” options for every product we carry.

check out “the clean 15″ though, where you’ll find some safer, less contaminated options.

farmers’ markets seem to be the best bet in the hunt for seasonal/local/organic.

if so, you’ll be delightfully surprised to learn of austin’s the burlap bag (502 west 30th street).
not all fake trees need be store-bought pvc saplings from china.
think of us as a grocery store for all your basics – milk, vinegar, toothpaste, flour, dishwashing detergent – as well as some “special” things like beer, wine, chicken feed, seeds, etc.
terms like organic, beyond-organic, biodynamic, local, heirloom, sustainable, green, natural, free-range, cage-free, pastured, grass-fed, grass-finished, gmo, chemical, big-ag, and toxic are thrown around.
for example, if you’re hungry, get some food – unless you have to go to the bathroom, and in that case go to the bathroom first.
we want to be a neighborhood store.
whether you chose a fake tree, real tree, (or no tree?) this year, knowing the facts will help you arrive at the best eco-friendly solution.
a little creativity and thinking out side the box could introduce some new and exciting holiday traditions!
theenvironmental working group (ewg) says that you should still eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, because their health benefits out-weigh the risk of pesticide exposure.
you could give it to goodwill, the salvation army, or maybe put it on craigslist.
one of the things i’ve become most excited about in anticipation of thein.gredients store opening: it’ll be so much easier to eat seasonal, local, organic/natural, produce.
however, for any tree, real or fake, you have think about where it will go at the end of its life cycle.
we want to make it easy for you to find ingredients and easy for you to do things with those ingredients.
for this caldo verderecipe (from allrecipes.com), you’ll need these veggies from your local farmer: kale, potatoes, onion, and garlic.
aside from farm-fresh veggies, you’ll need some olive oil and linguica sausage.
often times, a non-certified organic small farm may be a better environmental steward than a large national organic brand.
option: while sausage is traditional in this dish, it can be left out for a delicious vegan soup!
however, for any tree, real or fake, you have think about where it will go at the end of its life cycle.
the absence of one million tons of food scraps “saved 2.7 million cubic yards of landfill space and produced 600,000 cubic yards of finished compost.”
fake trees can last for decades, which is a great considering nothing is going to waste during its life-span.
once trees are dead they don’t use any co2, so they won’t be removing any more carbon from the air.
i think we’re all too familiar with the fact that the vast majority of produce available at most grocery stores isn’t locally sourced (in part due to the constant consumer demand for non-seasonal produce) – something that kind of gets me down.
additionally, the carbon storage feature on real trees is great, but it’s counterproductive if trees are cut down.

the idea is to simplify grocery shopping.
that’s a whoppingone million tons of solid waste that’s been spared from the landfill and put to good use rejuvenating local soil as compost.
