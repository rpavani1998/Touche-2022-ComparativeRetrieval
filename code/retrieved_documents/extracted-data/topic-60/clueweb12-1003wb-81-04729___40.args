why don't we have a great national team.... soccer is a very physical sport.
we are so much more respected now than we were 10 years ago but stupid articles like this are a weak attempt to keep our image at mediocre.
went to america to study for two years and was both surprised and disappointed, football-wise.
a while back, chelsea was spending 172m gbp (278.4m usd) on player wages...that's 27 players...over 10m per player average on a team.
we didn't score and were duly eliminated, losing our best chance in a long time to make it to the semi-finals.
plus they have qualified and for the last 5 world cups.
they don't understand football because they lack the ability to see beyond the shell.
i for one would do anything to send my youngest son overseas.
you cant measure success only by winning the world cup because you will always be a failure.
we are poor at soccer because we are not sufficiently technical let alone necessarily.
they missed the mark by not marketing hardcore rivalries that already existed in cities like seattle and portland.
i was just an average kid, but i wrote a report about pele in sixth grade, used to practice all the time against the back of my garage and the local kickboard, and dreamed of being a professional soccer player.
every game has to have the heart and devotion of the players for it to become a success.
it's no different than bowling or darts...tell me dale earnhardt could have ran a mile without a marlboro.
finally, if you think athleticism is an issue than you don't even understand the sport.
plenty of people are sons and grandsons of immigrants from many other places with great soccer teams.
if i want to see bad acting, i'll go watch a movie with january jones.
that's how other countries operate kasonde june 17th, 2011 9:05 pm et one more thing the usa dont need to find start player like pele or diego they need hard working and hungry players.
they would shout yes, everyone was very excited.
the current fa was good in terms of getting the association to point where it is today but in terms of making it global powerhouse,they fall short.
if they are carried off on a stretcher they should be off at least 5 minutes (again player safety) and more likely 10.
after all, i love the us and have always supported their national team.
we are much better than we were 10 years ago with almost all of our players playing in the best leagues in the world here in england or elsewhere in europe.
politics are a huge problem in ussf.
his lack of allowing "creative play" and "1 2 quick one touch passing triangulation and penetration is obvious and very alarming at this level.
never mind colleage sport, it's in the streets where the big names of the sport are made.
what you need is culture, culture that countries like malaysia or india lack with soccer and have plenty of in crickett....
a while back, chelsea was spending 172m gbp (278.4m usd) on player wages...that's 27 players...over 10m per player average on a team.
just assuming that those 32 american clubs are on par with england's in terms of youth development (which they obviously aren't) this means that american clubs are responsible for approximately 20 times as many people (1/3 number of clubs and 6 times the population) another factor is price.
americans play on groomed, immaculate fields and play without passion or creativity.
my concern for the usmnt is that they do well when they have faith in themselves but once they stop believing they lose.
no sponsors, no coverage, no money equals no sport.
it needs to be more earthy and authentic to life.
i don't call that a sign of a bad team.
freddy adu is perfect example.
providing opinion and in-depth analysis as well as a left field look at all things competitive.
germany is good example of country that did not produce the most talented player but they are mos successful than argentina, portugal and spain which have produced more talented players
they also like sports that have a lot of time outs.
2) they tried to market the game to the soccer moms and kids, instead of to the rabid soccer fans that either grew up or spent time overseas, and hardcore supporters groups.
the us is not going to walk in and win, it takes an investment in the future with youth soccer which is being done now in order to have any success.
also, as a benfica fan myself i would like to express my deep admiration of adu's talent.
this sport has taken hold finally because of the efforts of the last team to play in the world cup with that last minute win to qualify for the next round.
not to mention, major league soccer is picking up steam and a soccer game is a real event in seattle, portland and philly.
if you look at cities like portland, fans are coming to see the army, and learning about the game.
soccer requires a skill and finess that can not be made up for with raw athletic ability.
living in london, i can tell you that no english person was happy to have to play us in the wc last year and everyone was happy to come out of it with a 1-1 draw.
you see networks, corporate sponsors, and fans get half-heartedly behind the sport, but the money is nowhere near what it needs to be.
as a left back i can run, attach the ball in the air and tackle all day, but i have nothing approaching the skill and deft touch of the midfielders.
went to america to study for two years and was both surprised and disappointed, football-wise.
we are much better than we were 10 years ago with almost all of our players playing in the best leagues in the world here in england or elsewhere in europe.
they certainly wouldn't do it if they didn't think anyone was going to watch it.
specifically, bradley does not possess player evaluation and game management skills.
they now have some fine ball players playing over at inter and schalke, players who know to caress the football.
joe shoulders june 19th, 2011 7:44 pm et the nonsense about soccer not being taken seriously by the american public is way off.
we didn't score and were duly eliminated, losing our best chance in a long time to make it to the semi-finals.
1) when they built the league 20 years ago, they didn't focus on already football-rabid towns.
soccer has to compete with american football, baseball, and basketball for the best athletes.
he always takes the "safe" road.
and let's not forget that we beat spain, the number ranked team in the world, and were up on brazil 2-0 on a couple of beautiful goals, at the 2009 confederations cup.
long balls are not high percentage passes, for just like in basketball, the closer you are to your target, the more likely you are to hit it.
not great journalism by any means.
the rest of the time there was an inordinate amount of long balls send to altidor and others.
it was so much standing around waiting for guys to stop rolling around like a 5 year old that got pushed over.
we're just as good as england, as we proved in the world cup i recently wrote an article on soccer in the us.
just give it some more time, the us will get there, oguchi onyewu in portugal you will win!
i have a few boys, but my youngest who is 6 adores the sport, and those that see him play know he has a future in it.
someone who will improve the us on the tactical & technical departments and enable them find what their identity is as team because i'm not sure the us team know what it is.
and those teams are a bunch of low-class, red-card getting, complaining players who would not make it on another team – because of politics they make the team.
he belongs to benfica of portugal but spent the last season on loan in the turkish second division.
the usa has been the best team in concacaf for the past decade, though mexico is making a big comeback in that respect.
while it may not be at the at spain's or germany's level, that doesn't make us bad.
after holding season tickets in the army for 4 years.
i wonder if the journalist who wrote this knows that the us women soccer team is actually a force to reckon with.
we've had many brazilian soccer idols playing for the team such as ronaldo, rivellino and socrates and nowadays we're trying to bring back carlos tevez who played for corithians during 2005 season and also we have adriano.
6) americans love competitive sports and soccer is very competitive and like most sports in the usa it about heart, determination and have star player(s )to lead the team to glory and have supporting players who help the key players 7) the only problem is that the usa have not found a playing style that suits them, they like most team's the world they have not adopted soccer into their culture.
they would shout yes, everyone was very excited.
in my view there is one key factor which means america will never be a force in world football, and it is quite a simple one.
the problem is the mentality, is to get the children to dream of playing soccer, finding teammates, the infrastructure, local clubs who will take in those children and train them, see them as an investment, to later sell them.
with the amount of talented athelets on highschools and universities usa should easily be able to develop to it's full potencial in soccer...but as you say, the problem is not with the athelets, it is with the mentalities.
if play is stopped for an "injury" the player should be required to stay off the turf for 2 minutes (after all they are hurt are they not?).
great post pedro, as a portuguese citizen myself i also share your vision on the development of "soccer" in the united states.
soccer is the most international sport, the most passionated, the most exciting.
usa is great at all other sports, but never did much at soccer.
surprised to see so many people (including americans) actually love soccer.
it paid off handsomely, with donovan scoring moments into the second half.
when i have watched the us players i see a rush to kick the ball as far up the field as possible.
let's see how tough a soccer player is when he gets the ball in the nfl.
skill intensive sports cannot be tampered with just tweaked.
yet, when we were down one in overtime against ghana, he did not pull donovan up.
i am willing to bet my entire bank account, however meager the balance might be, that if fifa renamed the sport to "american soccer" the united states would win the next world cup.
yet, when we were down one in overtime against ghana, he did not pull donovan up.
because its a culture, but so far i do not see that in the us!
there's a popular domestic league that makes money, and europe has many players from the us.
americans think that football is boring.
sure their style of play isn't as exciting as brazil, but the way they passed the ball against germany in the semi-finals, as if they had the ball on a string, was beautiful nonetheless.
jok june 23rd, 2011 2:50 pm et united states of america will not be better in football until they accept it as footbaal.
wrong people running this "so called" powerful organization.
sport mimic's life, drama and all, when played well: american football does not.
after holding season tickets in the army for 4 years.
i don't care if you say football is a lot of standing around.
americans need to understand that soccer (or football), is the world sport, not baseball, not basketball, not volleyball, not american football.
the fact is to bring talent in and develop it here, you have to have money.
don't get me wrong: i love college basketball, but when soccer is good, it's hard to beat.
that would be a start to help the us mens national team.
that, combined with heavy snow in the northern parts make it difficult to play in the winter time unless there is an indoor facility nearby and this is typically reserved for the serious players.
so parents have them play, but then the kids see that the only people that still play soccer after elementary school are the ones that got cut from every other sport.
there is a lack of major talent from the us squad, but i believe both of these gentlemen are holding the current squad back even more.
that would be a start to help the us mens national team.
england have a population of around 50 million compared to our 300 million while we have 16 mls clubs, 5 nasl clubs, and 11 usl clubs compared to england's 92 league clubs.
we certainly have the talent if they would choose soccer over other sports.
when i saw him play i laughed, and wondered what the americans saw that was pele like.
i don't call that a sign of a bad team.
and those teams are a bunch of low-class, red-card getting, complaining players who would not make it on another team – because of politics they make the team.
most grow up playing some soccer but continue with the other sports because of possible riches isaac june 19th, 2011 12:29 pm et soccer was at almost zero just 18 years ago in the us.
winning a big international championship is the only thing that will give the mens' game a boost in the us.
the us has made tremendous strides in their team's performance and has adapted well to the multinational styles of the game but still lacks the passion that the rest of the world has for the sport.
it's popular with kids because it's cheap so parents have them play, but then the kids see that the only people that still play soccer after elementary school are the ones that got cut from every other sport.
with the amount of talented athelets on highschools and universities usa should easily be able to develop to it's full potencial in soccer...but as you say, the problem is not with the athelets, it is with the mentalities.
the us has none of this, so will struggle in mens' soccer.
united states of america will not be better in football until they accept it as footbaal.
the problem isn't money (e.g: brazil, uruguay, argentina, even some good african teams like ivory coast), nor is it population (e.g: england, france, germany, spain, portugal, netherlands).
i could point the author in the right direction to discover the reality of the sport's progress here, but when i read this broad, simplistic analysis, i really don't think it would be worth my time.
replay would help identify the "ghost" fouls and the "ghost" goals.
demóstenes june 17th, 2011 10:00 am et americans don't understand football (it's called football and not soccer).
leave the feudalistic, overspeending to european soccer.
that is just it, soccer goes non-stop were you don't stop for a budweiser or doritos commercial and broadcasters can't get sponsors which means no money.
hopefully more people will understand the game.
i could point the author in the right direction to discover the reality of the sport's progress here, but when i read this broad, simplistic analysis, i really don't think it would be worth my time.
soccer is not part of the country's culture.
i'll write another article complaining that since we have so many chinese descendants in america, we should be pro at pingpong.
as a left back i can run, attach the ball in the air and tackle all day, but i have nothing approaching the skill and deft touch of the midfielders.
i would love for those people to try playing for just 30mins not 90mins and see if they still think that way...
the structure to have fantastic local and national soccer teams has been in place in the usa for a very long time.
here's a super-talented kid with skills beyond anything we have seen the us and he has been flop because coaches (highly educated coaches), both here and europe (where coaching education is huge) choose to focus on what he can't do rather than what he can do better than anyone.
not to mention ea sports' fifa series sells more and more copies each year domestically and not to mention espn has made a concerted effort to give soccer more coverage..
not often noted, but the u.s. team was actually one of the more exciting teams to watch at this past summer's lackluster cup.
coruja june 17th, 2011 8:46 am et calling it football may be a good start...
we had two come-from-behind draws or wins, whereas the world's big three (messi, ronaldo, and rooney) failed to score a single goal between them.
im an italian/american, lived in the states for 7 years in chicago when i was younger, and yea, football didn't get much of the attention it deserved...
the us viewers which were in record numbers finally f felt that passion for the game and what it is all about.
furthermore, in the states, there are many other sports that football will never be able to compete with.
they drew with argentina and beat spain when they had faith but when they played brazil and ghana they lost their belief.
it paid off handsomely, with donovan scoring moments into the second half.
lulz june 17th, 2011 9:53 am et anyone who lives in the us could have already told you this.
2) secondly the money, countries that do well at football are richer countries they can hire the best coaches and train the players with best services available 3)third the usa was 3rd in the 1st world cup and did well in the 1st 20 years at the world cup.
there is a lack of major talent from the us squad, but i believe both of these gentlemen are holding the current squad back even more.
back to the u.s. team granted we have a huge drain of our talent into football, basketball, and baseball, etc., but i don't think that can account for the u.s. not being able to break into soccer's upper echelon.
so, even though the u.s. didn't get by ghana (who did, after all, beat brazil to win the under 20 world cup the year before), bob bradley was given a fair shake and another chance to advance in the world cup, but down the road we may need a foreign coach to bring about a change in our mindset and establish a possession game, the one thing that can perhaps take the united states to the next level.
i guess americans just don't understand how beautiful the game is and how real competition in that sport really is exciting.
the us viewers which were in record numbers finally f felt that passion for the game and what it is all about.
go make fun of them when your country wins as many world cups as italy has.
as worrying as the lack of success has been for the team as a whole, equally as worrying is the failure to find a phenomenon.
long balls are not high percentage passes, for just like in basketball, the closer you are to your target, the more likely you are to hit it.
i was just an average kid, but i wrote a report about pele in sixth grade, used to practice all the time against the back of my garage and the local kickboard, and dreamed of being a professional soccer player.
us is the homeland of sport, keep it that way.
we certainly have the talent if they would choose soccer over other sports.
also, there was a phenom in giussepe rossi who was born and raised in new jersey who decided to play for italy instead.
scudag56 june 20th, 2011 7:50 am et runners up in the confederations cup in 2009 (after beating spain and almost beating brazil in the finals) and making the round of 16 in the 2010 world cup (as far as england, mexico and portugal got).
as an american-argentine, i would like to say: "welcome to the club".
it's not just another trophy, not just something u can take away for the weekend.
kids are coached from early and it limits their natural ability.
first of all, football is not only the most popular worldwide sport is also the most competitive, at club lever there are at least 10 leagues with a similar level , serie a, torneo afa, campeonato paulista e carioca, la liga, bundesliga, epl, eurodivise, apertura mexicano and so on...... what is more, nowadays the idea of the big 4 (brazil, germany, italy, argentina) it does not correspond with the reality ( wc 1998 was the turning point), and for that reason you have brazil, argentina, germany, spain, england, uruguay , italy and france like powerhouses at international level , i do not think so honestly that usa has a real chance, think in the time that spain has to wait until win their 1st world cup.
get more money...get better, more notable talent, get better coaches...and, the problem will solve itself.
the us soccer coaching education programs have killed the creativity of american players by focusing on "coaching development" rather than player development.
oh, and did you really just compare soccer's popularity with nascar, a whitetrash competition that in no way should be honored with being in the category of "sport".
what you need is culture, culture that countries like malaysia or india lack with soccer and have plenty of in crickett....
there would be a lot less flopping if they know they would be off for long enough to really be checked for serious injury (they pop right off the stretcher as it is far too often).
patrick june 16th, 2011 7:55 pm et i agree that we should be better and we haven't achieved all we wanted by 2010 but in 2009 the men's national team beat the best team in the world (spain) at the confederations cup and went toe to toe with brazil in the confed cup final.
passion, tradition and media enthusiasm are missing where soccer's concerned.
on the other hand, football doesn't need the americans.
they know what they have to live up to but they haven't found that identity that defines as a team..
we need a brand that looks like the streets and is not overly sanitized.
disappointed with the fact that nobody actually cares about the development of the sport.
so why don't you go do more research, then write a well informed article that makes you sound like you didn't just crawl out from under a rock...
the reason football sorry soccer has not taken off is the tv stations wont push soccer is it would loose a lot of revenue on adds they run every 10 to 15 mins and in a soccer the match has to be playrd for 45 mins befor a add could be run.
once you show some results and there is media covering it, people will enjoy it.
us youth soccer is going the wrong way fast, and the only way to improve is to start up residential academies for all mls clubs, and pick players based on other factors than size and strength.
posted by: cnn world sport anchor, pedro pinto filed under: football some pretty diluted, and generalized comments we have here.
spent some money and get guus hiddink to coach the national us team.
germany is good example of country that did not produce the most talented player but they are mos successful than argentina, portugal and spain which have produced more talented players keith r june 17th,
no team in the history of the game (as far as i know) demonstrated this better than spain at the 2010 world cup.
so, even though the u.s. didn't get by ghana (who did, after all, beat brazil to win the under 20 world cup the year before), bob bradley was given a fair shake and another chance to advance in the world cup, but down the road we may need a foreign coach to bring about a change in our mindset and establish a possession game, the one thing that can perhaps take the united states to the next level.

once you show some results and there is media covering it, people will enjoy it.
china is the second biggest economy and has 6 times the population of the us... doesnt mean it will win the world cup, india same story.
us youth soccer is going the wrong way fast, and the only way to improve is to start up residential academies for all mls clubs, and pick players based on other factors than size and strength.
if you look at cities like portland, fans are coming to see the army, and learning about the game.
you talked about snow in the winter months being a factor, but are you not aware that european countries also suffers from the same winter condition.
don't get me wrong: i love college basketball, but when soccer is good, it's hard to beat.
soccer normally falls into a similar demographic as basketball does in the us, impoverished families, but in the us local clubs charge upwards of $1000 (and do so rightly as they wouldn't exist without the funding) for players to travel whereas european clubs allow free to play opportunities.
perhaps it's because more due to the fact that soccer is hardly an inner city sport in america, as basketball reigns supreme, but it is with the middle class of america that can be seen kicking a ball around.
living in london, i can tell you that no english person was happy to have to play us in the wc last year and everyone was happy to come out of it with a 1-1 draw.
4) many big team's always say that the usmnt is very hard to beat at the world cup's they may not be the most talented but they know how to frustrate big teams 5) soccer/football is very much an american sport, its the most capitalistic sport there is clubs can buy many player they want and winners takes all.
the youth programs and leagues are money based and "win at all costs" to make the club and coach look good in order to attract the "best" players with money to inflate the club's accounts.
(and brazil, we'll try not to giggle when you have a power outage during wc 2014.)
professional system must link with youth system and create a viable farm system.
cheerleaders and great beer commercials-not in soccer kt june 18th, 2011 1:12 pm et its so funny when the yanks called football a 'sissy sport'.
it's hard to squeeze commercials into a game with few (if any) disruptions.
i find that men who play soccer have very litle patience with trying to explain the game to people who have not.
england have a population of around 50 million compared to our 300 million while we have 16 mls clubs, 5 nasl clubs, and 11 usl clubs compared to england's 92 league clubs.
with some fans i've talked to, the enjoyment of watching the supporters groups has acted as a bridge to understanding the play on the field.
awilson in dr july 5th, 2011 12:27 pm et coaching, first.
the problem isn't money (e.g: brazil, uruguay, argentina, even some good african teams like ivory coast), nor is it population (e.g: england, france, germany, spain, portugal, netherlands).
the average pay on the highest paid team (new york redbulls) is a bit under $450k a year per player.
17th, 2011 11:09 am et soccer wasn't always a soft sport...it's the current generation of diving prima-donna players, crying out for the referee's attention when they've barely been scratched, that has given it this image.
the us has the strong organizational discipline, what it doesn't have is patience.
let it simmer naturally, build the tradition and results will come.
so their top athletes play soccer.
one last thing, half the, uhm, "athletes" in baseball and american football really shouldn't be regarded as such.... if your gonna play a sport professionally and get paid huge sums of money for it, then a. lose weight and get fit b. actually give it your all when playing :p
we won our group in last year's world cup and are favoured to win the gold cup.
finally, about being a soft sport, i want to be a yank, brit or from any other country outside south america playing at the morumbi, bombonera, centenario, with thousands of supporters chanting with fireworks, which can easily make you feel like a completely yellow....... of coarse america is destined for greater skies as far as footbal isconcerned they only needs to be positive if they want to develop their game

you can read it at http://tinyurl.com/6kd4ynr thank you its because they are such pussies now.
unlike any other sport soccer requires a true athlete with real talent.
tell me one town, schoo or company that doesn't have some kind of team in place.
the reason that soccer is not popular in the u.s. is because it is a mans sport.

the best athletes then may prefer to kick a ball rather than throw it.

it is useless to finance a team to grow into an arsenal squad in a determined year.
alexgloc june 21st, 2011 1:15 am et hey, demostenes and the rest of you "football" fans.
they need to modernize the officiating.
winning a big international championship is the only thing that will give the mens' game a boost in the us.

pedro june 20th, 2011 9:56 pm et until the vast majority of americans get over themselves and realize that there are other sports being played outside of the us borders (like soccer for instance), and that they aren't the best at it, they will never be good at soccer.
1)off-course the usa should be better at football/soccer.
diogo forte june 17th, 2011 10:11 am et great post pedro, as a portuguese citizen myself i also share your vision on the development of "soccer" in the united states.
the us is not going to walk in and win, it takes an investment in the future with youth soccer which is being done now in order to have any success.
they will score about the same amount of goals and they don't stop when someone scrapes their knee.
i think project 2010 was a success, because the usmnt is a lot better than what it was 10 years ago, but they need to make the next step.
it's not coincidence that almost everywhere on easth millions love it.
it needs to be more earthy and authentic to life.
to be a great football player, you must start from an early age playing it with your neighbours.
he dictates who the mnt coach selects and plays.
if soccer was important in the us i knew he would be noticed for an academy program like you find in england, and spain.
their are plenty of interested youth but simply no way of training them properly.
replay would help identify the "ghost" fouls and the "ghost" goals.
and as long as mls clubs recruit internationally for their youth academies instead of giving american citizens a chance, us soccer will never progress.
when team usa lost to panama and then had to battle long and hard to beat guadeloupe in the gold cup, i thought it was time for a reality check.
while it may not be at the at spain's or germany's level, that doesn't make us bad.
for instance that corinthians is the biggest soccer club in brazil and has more than 33 million fans only inside the country and many others around the world.
their are plenty of interested youth but simply no way of training them properly.
not to mention, major league soccer is picking up steam and a soccer game is a real event in seattle, portland and philly.
that's how other countries operate one more thing the usa dont need to find start player like pele or diego they need hard working and hungry players.
his lack of allowing "creative play" and "1 2 quick one touch passing triangulation and penetration is obvious and very alarming at this level.
towns and cities have great fields and set up leagues for children as young as 4, elementary and high schools have their teams, the towns team structure and in many cases intramural teams; and the same for colleges and companies.
look no farther than guiseppe rossi and neven subotic for proof that these so called imigrant's children are real but they only develop because they are trained by capable hands and not just foreign parents who were fans in their own country.
it's a shame too, because it is such a beautiful, pure sport.
the us are not bad at soccer.
soccer has to compete with american football, baseball, and basketball for the best athletes.
leave the feudalistic, overspeending to european soccer.
june 16th, 2011 7:11 pm et us national team needs to get rid of bob bradley and his boss, whoever/whatever his names is... + there isn't enough money in soccer like it is in american football, basketball, baseball etc...
give the us some time, once soccer's popularity grows we will begin to see world class soccer players.
it's not coincidence that almost everywhere on easth millions love it.
this is the same sort of analysis i've seen time and again by members of the foreign media who take five minutes to look at soccer in the u.s. and start drawing conclusions.
kasonde june 17th, 2011 9:01 pm et 1)off-course the usa should be better at football/soccer.
they don't understand football because they lack the ability to see beyond the shell.
you talked about snow in the winter months being a factor, but are you not aware that european countries also suffers from the same winter condition.
if you are an up-and-coming athlete, there is no "big money" to be had pursuing a career in soccer, unless you are amazing enough to be scouted by the premier european teams with unreal bank accounts.
soccer is a game for sissies.
in brazil and in europe, you will see players being reared from a young age, from a small club, to bigger clubs etc... they have to be interested, and they need to understand there is a possible career in the game for them.
and as long as mls clubs recruit internationally for their youth academies instead of giving american citizens a chance, us soccer will never progress.
because its a culture, but so far i do not see that in the us!
it's impossible for the us to gain that culture by simply importing talent from it's immigrants...it might take at least 20 years before the us becomes top 10 in the world....but that won't happen before they will become aware of the sport, and that has yet to happen, not when baseball and basketball are around...and by fair trade...you can't always be good in everything.
anyone who lives in the us could have already told you this.
it's a shame too, because it is such a beautiful, pure sport.
i read one blog of a guy who said he'd never watched a soccer game in his life, but he found the slovenia game more exciting than any football or basketball game he'd ever seen.
it is useless to finance a team to grow into an arsenal squad in a determined year.
he preference for hard-working, simple players (like his son) over less predictable talents (like adu or jose francisco torres).
also, due to the volume of comments we receive, not all comments will be posted.
they get taken off on a stretcher then hop right up when the other guy gets a card.
i agree that we should be better and we haven't achieved all we wanted by 2010 but in 2009 the men's national team beat the best team in the world (spain) at the confederations cup and went toe to toe with brazil in the confed cup final.
i have played american football, men's league and college rugby, and men's league soccer and soccer by far is the roughest.
if soccer was important in the us i knew he would be noticed for an academy program like you find in england, and spain.
i hope american kids of this next generation can bring up this culture and mature in to something the us can be proud of.
i don't know much, but i blame the mls for lack of us passion, and for two reasons.
it's actually the absence of goals and all the close calls or near goals in soccer that raise the spectator's desire and make the actual goals so fulfilling.
i was really excited for the world cup then watch about half of a game and couldn't stand watching anymore because how dramatic they had to make everything.
the problem is not a lack of interest but a lack of coaching and infrastructure.
specially in high school, i cant tell you how blatantly obvious it was that the sports teams budget was basically divided up like 60% to the american football team, 30% to basketball and 10% to the soccer team.........
(see link below) from the fifa site: http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/ranking/lastranking/gender=f/fullranking.html goes to show what consideration they show to women in sports.
to think its as simple as 'get soccer into the culture of the people' is so silly..
to think its as simple as 'get soccer into the culture of the people' is so silly..
he's incredibly talented, don't get me wrong, but his arrogance is repulsive.
the timeouts of the game are bigger then the game itself.
even on the youngest rbny pre-academy teams, you can see international players and players from well outside nyc.
they need to attract foreign coaches who have very good technical nous to the clubs they already have.
the nonsense about soccer not being taken seriously by the american public is way off.
soccer normally falls into a similar demographic as basketball does in the us, impoverished families, but in the us local clubs charge upwards of $1000 (and do so rightly as they wouldn't exist without the funding) for players to travel whereas european clubs allow free to play opportunities.
having watched argentina win two world cups, only to be surpassed by brazil, germany, and italy, you need to understand that this is one prize you can not win by using powerpoint slides, or throwing money at it..
the us has none of this, so will struggle in mens' soccer.
you can't go from bad to amazing with money.
i would say that was being a major player in world soccer.
when our best athletes want to play football, baseball, basketball before soccer it puts us at a disadvantage.
he always takes the "safe" road.
yea maybe it was a bit unrealistic to set 2010 as a date for churning out global superstars but lets be real we're a top 20 soccer team in the world when playing at our best and the youth in our pipeline are going to do even better than their predecessors given the increases in the caliber of coaching we are currently able to provide..
as a result, big rivalries on tv showed empty stands and little interest.
the "floppers" get rewarded.
i have played american football, men's league and college rugby, and men's league soccer and soccer by far is the roughest.
at least in hockey people beat the crap out of each other......but in soccer all people do is fall down and pretend that they were hit to get a yellow/red card.
tedaj june 17th, 2011 10:06 am et i'm from asia and i love football.
with some fans i've talked to, the enjoyment of watching the supporters groups has acted as a bridge to understanding the play on the field.
this last weekend at the timbers/nyrb game i realized i was starting to understand the game when i groaned at several bad crosses and cheered for a goal-saving bicycle kick (albeit by the other team).
never mind colleage sport, it's in the streets where the big names of the sport are made.
imho, they made a mistake paying so much for beckham.
the usa female team is the most successful team on the women's side and currently number one, if the women in the usa can do it why can the men.
3 officials is not enough for 22 players on the large playing surface.
it may have the financial backing but without the drive it will not move forward.
i don't know much, but i blame the mls for lack of us passion, and for two reasons.
having watched argentina win two world cups, only to be surpassed by brazil, germany, and italy, you need to understand that this is one prize you can not win by using powerpoint slides, or throwing money at it..
statistics show that only one shot in nine scores, so the team that has the ball the most, shoots the most, and therefore scores the most.

american football, basketball, baseball, nascar and golf, for example, all get more coverage and more attention than soccer.
after all, i love the us and have always supported their national team.
yes, but first of all, you should know much more about it.
look no farther than guiseppe rossi and neven subotic for proof that these so called imigrant's children are real but they only develop because they are trained by capable hands and not just foreign parents who were fans in their own country.
this means that american clubs are responsible for approximately 20 times as many people (1/3 number of clubs and 6 times the population) another factor is price.
if play is stopped for an "injury" the player should be required to stay off the turf for 2 minutes (after all they are hurt are they not?).
that, combined with heavy snow in the northern parts make it difficult to play in the winter time unless there is an indoor facility nearby and this is typically reserved for the serious players.
you cant measure success only by winning the world cup because you will always be a failure.
the usa has been the best team in concacaf for the past decade, though mexico is making a big comeback in that respect.
hopefully we'll get better as the generations go on.
but if you want to say its tough because they run for so long then lets all go sit around and watch guys run a marathon.
the problem is the mentality, is to get the children to dream of playing soccer, finding teammates, the infrastructure, local clubs who will take in those children and train them, see them as an investment, to later sell them.
comments are moderated by cnn, in accordance with the cnn comment policy, and may not appear on this blog until they have been reviewed and deemed appropriate for posting.
they achieved an astounding 89% success rate for their passes, and actually passed the ball 200 more times per game than the tournament average.
the bottom line is more people watch the world cup than all the olympics combined.
when our best athletes want to play football, baseball, basketball before soccer it puts us at a disadvantage.
we teach kids a civil game, where the boundaries of pushing, pulling, grabbing is not tolerated at the younger levels.
i bet a ton of wide receivers and centerfielders would have made great soccer players but they had to make a choice and there is simply no money to be made playing us soccer because of the lack of commercial breaks and sponsorship opportunities.
that way they can relax in the sofa (or in the stadium) and get something to eat (their favourite sport).
they barely get touched and roll around on the ground holding their leg when someone bumped their arm.
this leaves most us youth playing in poorly maintained environments with uneducated coaches and all of this fails to account for the fact that this simply shows how far behind the us is to england who are having their own problems developing players right now with a dismal performance in the world cup and the u21 european championships.
you are used to deal with avarages and percentages in sports like tennis, american football, basketball or baseball.
the ussf is a close minded "click" and relies on it's "own" to provide information on players and coaches rather than allow all avenues of information to get to the decision makers within.
finally, about being a soft sport, i want to be a yank, brit or from any other country outside south america playing at the morumbi, bombonera, centenario, with thousands of supporters chanting with fireworks, which can easily make you feel like a completely yellow....... morgan august 27th, 2011 11:59 am et of coarse america is destined for greater skies as far as footbal isconcerned they only needs to be positive if they want to develop their game
americans need to understand that soccer (or football), is the world sport, not baseball, not basketball, not volleyball, not american football.
we have better things to watch.
this leaves most us youth playing in poorly maintained environments with uneducated coaches and all of this fails to account for the fact that this simply shows how far behind the us is to england who are having their own problems developing players right now with a dismal performance in the world cup and the u21 european championships.
i read one blog of a guy who said he'd never watched a soccer game in his life, but he found the slovenia game more exciting than any football or basketball game he'd ever seen.
the players get tripped, fall dramatically then stay on the ground until they are carried off after almost every play.
it's impossible for the us to gain that culture by simply importing talent from it's immigrants...it might take at least 20 years before the us becomes top 10 in the world....but that won't happen before they will become aware of the sport, and that has yet to happen, not when baseball and basketball are around...and by fair trade...you can't always be good in everything.
4) many big team's always say that the usmnt is very hard to beat at the world cup's they may not be the most talented but they know how to frustrate big teams 5) soccer/football is very much an american sport, its the most capitalistic sport there is clubs can buy many player they want and winners takes all.
the reason that soccer is not popular in the u.s. is because it is a mans sport.
my u19 team plays a better system of play than our mnt does.
if you are an up-and-coming athlete, there is no "big money" to be had pursuing a career in soccer, unless you are amazing enough to be scouted by the premier european teams with unreal bank accounts.
i liked to think the mls is finally getting the second bit better, but after the way the new england supporters group was treated in the fort last week, it reinforces that the marketing still has a ways to go.
you are used to deal with avarages and percentages in sports like tennis, american football, basketball or baseball.
hopefully we'll get better as the generations go on.
he is the last soccer player i would want anyone looking up to (expect for maradona).
the buzz around portland is thick, the waiting list for tickets is long, and the experience for the fans is top flight.
american football is a collision sport yet does no have nearly as many "stretcher" cases.
the usa female team is the most successful team on the women's side and currently number one, if the women in the usa can do it why can the men.
the us has the strong organizational discipline, what it doesn't have is patience.
bradley needs to go and coach like marcelo bielsa or even villas-boas should be brought in.
the us have all the potential to do well even if it's not sport number one.
1) when they built the league 20 years ago, they didn't focus on already football-rabid towns.
apparently every country is good at certain things be it sports or other stuff.
the average pay on the highest paid team (new york redbulls) is a bit under $450k a year per player.
not often noted, but the u.s. team was actually one of the more exciting teams to watch at this past summer's lackluster cup.
usa is great at all other sports, but never did much at soccer.
my u19 team plays a better system of play than our mnt does.
that money would have been better spent on bring in other talent and coaches from europe and south america.
so i do believe that the u.s. should be way better due to the factors you listed, but once more its about loving to play the game and nothing more.
i recently wrote an article on soccer in the us.
i was really excited for the world cup then watch about half of a game and couldn't stand watching anymore because how dramatic they had to make everything.
let's see how tough a soccer player is when he gets the ball in the nfl.
you cannot simply take 10 years of publicity and make this sport part of the national past time.
that is just it, soccer goes non-stop were you don't stop for a budweiser or doritos commercial and broadcasters can't get sponsors which means no money.
he's a terrible teammate and his personal life is abominable.
our anglo-saxon cousins are equally inept at world football because the english value industry over grace, or graft over gift.
bruce arena did a great job at virginia, d.c. united, and at the u.s. national team, but when he went to a one forward lineup at the 2006 world cup, that didn't bode well for either the team or his job prospects.
so, if there is one thing football officials would have to do to change all of this it is to market football in a different way.
do you watch big european clubs competing or even the quality of the spanish/english/italian/german leagues ... when there is a football match the weekly stuff people take a break and head to the stadiums or gather with friends to follow up.
china is the second biggest economy and has 6 times the population of the us... doesnt mean it will win the world cup, india same story.
we have better things to watch.
i for one would do anything to send my youngest son overseas.
they have population of over 200 million people, most countries with large populations does well football.
instead of trying to learn the chants, i was trying to juggle chanting with cheering for good play on the field, regardless if it yielded a goal.
soccer will never succeed in the us, because there are no time-outs for commercials on tv.
usa went from being a world cup non entity to making the quarterfinals in 02, flopping in 06, to winning its group in '10.
here's a super-talented kid with skills beyond anything we have seen the us and he has been flop because coaches (highly educated coaches), both here and europe (where coaching education is huge) choose to focus on what he can't do rather than what he can do better than anyone.
successful countries see it as a game, a pass time like music as opposed to a chance to show superiority.
next article: murray unlikely to win wimbledon despite recent success world sport blog world sport provides an inside track to the major issues and stories making news in the world of sport with cnn's anchors, correspondents and journalists
2) secondly the money, countries that do well at football are richer countries they can hire the best coaches and train the players with best services available 3)third the usa was 3rd in the 1st world cup and did well in the 1st 20 years at the world cup.
i think project 2010 was a success, because the usmnt is a lot better than what it was 10 years ago, but they need to make the next step.
he was amazing with the american youth teams in his teens, even signing with the mls as a 14-year-old.
eg brazil, germany and italy are very successful because they understand soccer that have adapted it to their key strength 8)another problems is in soccer players don't go college they go to soccer academies to improve their skills.
if usa is not the big countries im sure messi will be the highest earning among the sportsman..
your readers deserve better.
you can't develop a whole league of top-flight players on a shoestring budget.
same way with the african team's and some european teams.
they know what they have to live up to but they haven't found that identity that defines as a team..
earnhardt could have ran a mile without a marlboro.
awful 'journalism' football has many fans in the us especially after thier good showing in the world cup.
soccer is the most international sport, the most passionated, the most exciting.
this is a life long thirst that no one will let u just take home.
for instance that corinthians is the biggest soccer club in brazil and has more than 33 million fans only inside the country and many others around the world.
john hillman june 21st, 2011 12:24 am et soccer is a game for sissies.
until the vast majority of americans get over themselves and realize that there are other sports being played outside of the us borders (like soccer for instance), and that they aren't the best at it, they will never be good at soccer.
i liked to think the mls is finally getting the second bit better, but after the way the new england supporters group was treated in the fort last week, it reinforces that the marketing still has a ways to go.
i would love for those people to try playing for just 30mins not 90mins and see if they still think that way...
this type of thinking filters down throughout us soccer resulting in a very ordinary product on the field.
off-course you don't need arrogance but but respect of the game 11) also the usa have talent, they need better scouts they should pick every type of player whether they are athletic or not whether big or small they should pick kids from all walks of life whether surban kids or kids in the streets.
they tried to recreate city rivalries already in others, ie: new england and new york.
it's hard to squeeze commercials into a game with few (if any) disruptions.
first of all, football is not only the most popular worldwide sport is also the most competitive, at club lever there are at least 10 leagues with a similar level , serie a, torneo afa, campeonato paulista e carioca, la liga, bundesliga, epl, eurodivise, apertura mexicano and so on...... what is more, nowadays the idea of the big 4 (brazil, germany, italy, argentina) it does not correspond with the reality ( wc 1998 was the turning point), and for that reason you have brazil, argentina, germany, spain, england, uruguay , italy and france like powerhouses at international level , i do not think so honestly that usa has a real chance, think in the time that spain has to wait until win their 1st world cup.
specially in high school, i cant tell you how blatantly obvious it was that the sports teams budget was basically divided up like 60% to the american football team, 30% to basketball and 10% to the soccer team.........
the problem is not a lack of interest but a lack of coaching and infrastructure.
bigokietechie june 17th, 2011 3:28 pm et soccer will never be big in america also because of one other thing: money.
give the us some time, once soccer's popularity grows we will begin to see world class soccer players.
not to mention ea sports' fifa series sells more and more copies each year domestically and not to mention espn has made a concerted effort to give soccer more coverage..
he dictates who the mnt coach selects and plays.
we are poor at soccer because we are not sufficiently technical let alone necessarily.
and let's not forget that we beat spain, the number ranked team in the world, and were up on brazil 2-0 on a couple of beautiful goals, at the 2009 confederations cup.
as for american success in soccer, don't forget that the us knocked out future world champions spain in the 2009 confederation cup semi-final and were still drawing with brazil at half-time going into the final.
it may have the financial backing but without the drive it will not move forward.
i played every two days and the field/court was always full.
passion, tradition and media enthusiasm are missing where soccer's concerned.
with a population of over 300 million and with a large percentage of immigrants from countries where football is king, it is my belief there should be more talent in america.
tell me one town, schoo or company that doesn't have some kind of team in place.
this is the same sort of analysis i've seen time and again by members of the foreign media who take five minutes to look at soccer in the u.s. and start drawing conclusions.
not to mention player communication skills.
the players get tripped, fall dramatically then stay on the ground until they are carried off after almost every play.
soccer will never be big in america also because of one other thing: money.
go make fun of them when your country wins as many world cups as italy has.
as i like to say, i came for the army, and stayed for the timber.
this is a life long thirst that no one will let u just take home.
3 officials is not enough for 22 players on the large playing surface.
disappointed with the fact that nobody actually cares about the development of the sport.
as for american success in soccer, don't forget that the us knocked out future world champions spain in the 2009 confederation cup semi-final and were still drawing with brazil at half-time going into the final.
well the talent is here believe me, i alwayys thought i was great at soccer i played in a couple of state level occer in mexico, and when i back to the united states playing in high school destroyed my mentality of being good, many white americans i encountered were just amazing, but none of them see themselves playing pro why?
jimmy june 21st, 2011 5:55 am et well the talent is here believe me, i alwayys thought i was great at soccer i played in a couple of state level occer in mexico, and when i back to the united states playing in high school destroyed my mentality of being good, many white americans i encountered were just amazing, but none of them see themselves playing pro why?
back to the u.s. team granted we have a huge drain of our talent into football, basketball, and baseball, etc., but i don't think that can account for the u.s. not being able to break into soccer's upper echelon.
why don't we have a great national team.... soccer is a very physical sport.
bruce arena did a great job at virginia, d.c. united, and at the u.s. national team, but when he went to a one forward lineup at the 2006 world cup, that didn't bode well for either the team or his job prospects.
even on the youngest rbny pre-academy teams, you can see international players and players from well outside nyc.
that way they can relax in the sofa (or in the stadium) and get something to eat (their favourite sport).
skill intensive sports cannot be tampered with just tweaked.
off-course you don't need arrogance but but respect of the game 11) also the usa have talent, they need better scouts they should pick every type of player whether they are athletic or not whether big or small they should pick kids from all walks of life whether surban kids or kids in the streets.
you can't plan it, you can only nurture it.
the us has made tremendous strides in their team's performance and has adapted well to the multinational styles of the game but still lacks the passion that the rest of the world has for the sport.
we won our group in last year's world cup and are favoured to win the gold cup.
oh, and did you really just compare soccer's popularity with nascar, a whitetrash competition that in no way should be honored with being in the category of "sport".
in brazil and in europe, you will see players being reared from a young age, from a small club, to bigger clubs etc... they have to be interested, and they need to understand there is a possible career in the game for them.
plenty of people are sons and grandsons of immigrants from many other places with great soccer teams.
the us soccer coaching education programs have killed the creativity of american players by focusing on "coaching development" rather than player development.
i hope american kids of this next generation can bring up this culture and mature in to something the us can be proud of.
so american children, young adults, men and women love watching and playing soccer.
but "soccer" is mostly about talent and what we in europe call "in game events" wich make it one of the most unpredictable sports to ever be created.
also, as a benfica fan myself i would like to express my deep admiration of adu's talent.
the only time the united states played any possession soccer was during the first half against england.
sport mimic's life, drama and all, when played well: american football does not.
we teach kids a civil game, where the boundaries of pushing, pulling, grabbing is not tolerated at the younger levels.
we had two come-from-behind draws or wins, whereas the world's big three (messi, ronaldo, and rooney) failed to score a single goal between them.
when i saw him play i laughed, and wondered what the americans saw that was pele like.
american football is a collision sport yet does no have nearly as many "stretcher" cases.
dart june 17th, 2011 6:51 pm et futbol has to do with tradition and culture as it is with careful planning.
the buzz around portland is thick, the waiting list for tickets is long, and the experience for the fans is top flight.
like music it needs to come naturally, just as rock, the blues, jazz, hip hop it needs to come from the natural tendency of the people and then grow.
i am willing to bet my entire bank account, however meager the balance might be, that if fifa renamed the sport to "american soccer" the united states would win the next world cup.
specifically, bradley does not possess player evaluation and game management skills.
he is the last soccer player i would want anyone looking up to (expect for maradona).
when the u.s. was down 2-0 against slovenia, to start the second half, he brought donovan up as a forward along with dempsey and altador for a three forward lineup, ala brazil.
usa went from being a world cup non entity to making the quarterfinals in 02, flopping in 06, to winning its group in '10.
i would say that was being a major player in world soccer.
to be defeated by a team ranked 67 in the world and then barely beat another not even officially affiliated with concacaf, the regional football body that covers north and central america and the caribbean, is surely not good enough.
so why don't you go do more research, then write a well informed article that makes you sound like you didn't just crawl out from under a rock...
you can't plan it, you can only nurture it.
get more money...get better, more notable talent, get better coaches...and, the problem will solve itself.
6) americans love competitive sports and soccer is very competitive and like most sports in the usa it about heart, determination and have star player(s )to lead the team to glory and have supporting players who help the key players 7) the only problem is that the usa have not found a playing style that suits them, they like most team's the world they have not adopted soccer into their culture.
that money would have been better spent on bring in other talent and coaches from europe and south america.
soccer requires a skill and finess that can not be made up for with raw athletic ability.
most grow up playing some soccer but continue with the other sports because of possible riches soccer was at almost zero just 18 years ago in the us.
the us womens team seem to be pretty good.
the ussf is a close minded "click" and relies on it's "own" to provide information on players and coaches rather than allow all avenues of information to get to the decision makers within.
the reason football sorry soccer has not taken off is the tv stations wont push soccer is it would loose a lot of revenue on adds they run every 10 to 15 mins and in a soccer the match has to be playrd for 45 mins befor a add could be run.
when the u.s. was down 2-0 against slovenia, to start the second half, he brought donovan up as a forward along with dempsey and altador for a three forward lineup, ala brazil.
you can read it at http://tinyurl.com/6kd4ynr thank you its called soccer here june 17th, 2011 10:05 pm et its because they are such pussies now.
it was so much standing around waiting for guys to stop rolling around like a 5 year old that got pushed over.
it's actually the absence of goals and all the close calls or near goals in soccer that raise the spectator's desire and make the actual goals so fulfilling.
you cannot simply take 10 years of publicity and make this sport part of the national past time.
americans don't understand football (it's called football and not soccer).
my concern for the usmnt is that they do well when they have faith in themselves but once they stop believing they lose.
mr. pinto does not understand this game and therefore should not comment on what he does not know.
otherwise, keep acting like u dont care about soccer anyway...
we need a new brand of football that is more urgent, agile and ruff and tumble.
they don’t have to spend money bringing the likes of david beckham and thierry henry to their professional league, they have to go around schools with dvds of cristiano ronaldo, lionel messi and company and actually show them how cool the sport can be from an early age.
sure their style of play isn't as exciting as brazil, but the way they passed the ball against germany in the semi-finals, as if they had the ball on a string, was beautiful nonetheless.
i agree that the people in charge are stagnating us soccer, and sunil and bob should go as they have overstayed their welcome.
worrell june 17th, 2011 12:40 pm et freedy adu was touted as the next pele- by whom.
second, the italians don't call it "football" either ("sfera del piede" or "piedepalla" or some such).
we need a new brand of football that is more urgent, agile and ruff and tumble.
where they cand call themselves world champions although no one else in the world plays that sport.
in contrast, spain and barcelona start their attack from behind!
towns and cities have great fields and set up leagues for children as young as 4, elementary and high schools have their teams, the towns team structure and in many cases intramural teams; and the same for colleges and companies.
this last weekend at the timbers/nyrb game i realized i was starting to understand the game when i groaned at several bad crosses and cheered for a goal-saving bicycle kick (albeit by the other team).
on the other hand, football doesn't need the americans.
so american children, young adults, men and women love watching and playing soccer.
the rest of the time there was an inordinate amount of long balls send to altidor and others.
like music it needs to come naturally, just as rock, the blues, jazz, hip hop it needs to come from the natural tendency of the people and then grow.
they tried to recreate city rivalries already in others, ie: new england and new york.
not great journalism by any means.
he preference for hard-working, simple players (like his son) over less predictable talents (like adu or jose francisco torres).
so i do believe that the u.s. should be way better due to the factors you listed, but once more its about loving to play the game and nothing more.
this type of thinking filters down throughout us soccer resulting in a very ordinary product on the field.
they now have some fine ball players playing over at inter and schalke, players who know to caress the football.
i have a few boys, but my youngest who is 6 adores the sport, and those that see him play know he has a future in it.
they missed the mark by not marketing hardcore rivalries that already existed in cities like seattle and portland.
the timeouts of the game are bigger then the game itself.
if they are carried off on a stretcher they should be off at least 5 minutes (again player safety) and more likely 10.
statistics show that only one shot in nine scores, so the team that has the ball the most, shoots the most, and therefore scores the most.
successful countries see it as a game, a pass time like music as opposed to a chance to show superiority.
they achieved an astounding 89% success rate for their passes, and actually passed the ball 200 more times per game than the tournament average.
us will only get better, though it needs some reorganization at the top (not going to happen), along with a coaching change (bradley did ok but his style has gone stale.)
riccardo june 17th, 2011 10:52 am et im an italian/american, lived in the states for 7 years in chicago when i was younger, and yea, football didn't get much of the attention it deserved...
but if you want to say its tough because they run for so long then lets all go sit around and watch guys run a marathon.
they won because of la masia and the ideology of one johan cruyff.
eg brazil, germany and italy are very successful because they understand soccer that have adapted it to their key strength 8)another problems is in soccer players don't go college they go to soccer academies to improve their skills.
every game has to have the heart and devotion of the players for it to become a success.
as a result, big rivalries on tv showed empty stands and little interest.
world sport provides an inside track to the major issues and stories making news in the world of sport with cnn's anchors, correspondents and journalists providing opinion and in-depth analysis as well as a left field look at all things competitive.
our anglo-saxon cousins are equally inept at world football because the english value industry over grace, or graft over gift.
when there is a football match the weekly stuff people take a break and head to the stadiums or gather with friends to follow up.
finally, if you think athleticism is an issue than you don't even understand the sport.
usa is way better than it was 10 years ago.
another tip, us coaches should start in europe as a assistant under coaches who have proved themselves.
the us were as athletic as anyone at the world cup but lost out to well trained skill and intelligence.
otherwise, keep acting like u dont care about soccer anyway...
in contrast, spain and barcelona start their attack from behind!
us is the homeland of sport, keep it that way.
2) they tried to market the game to the soccer moms and kids, instead of to the rabid soccer fans that either grew up or spent time overseas, and hardcore supporters groups.
where they cand call themselves world champions although no one else in the world plays that sport.
eddie june 17th, 2011 1:11 pm et soccer (football) is not a sport that is part of the north american culture.
again a very arrogant close minded individual.
we are so much more respected now than we were 10 years ago but stupid articles like this are a weak attempt to keep our image at mediocre.
us will only get better, though it needs some reorganization at the top (not going to happen), along with a coaching change (bradley did ok but his style has gone stale.)
kids are coached from early and it limits their natural ability.
bill june 17th, 2011 8:58 am et soccer will never succeed in the us, because there are no time-outs for commercials on tv.
the us have all the potential to do well even if it's not sport number one.
so their top athletes play soccer.
i played every two days and the field/court was always full.
runners up in the confederations cup in 2009 (after beating spain and almost beating brazil in the finals) and making the round of 16 in the 2010 world cup (as far as england, mexico and portugal got).
i find that men who play soccer have very litle patience with trying to explain the game to people who have not.
he's a terrible teammate and his personal life is abominable.
there's a popular domestic league that makes money, and europe has many players from the us.
there would be a lot less flopping if they know they would be off for long enough to really be checked for serious injury (they pop right off the stretcher as it is far too often).
also, due to the volume of comments we receive, not all comments will be posted.
instead of trying to learn the chants, i was trying to juggle chanting with cheering for good play on the field, regardless if it yielded a goal.
was considered a good team last wc, and in the women's is one of the best.
i agree that the people in charge are stagnating us soccer, and sunil and bob should go as they have overstayed their welcome.
to be a great football player, you must start from an early age playing it with your neighbours.
yea maybe it was a bit unrealistic to set 2010 as a date for churning out global superstars but lets be real we're a top 20 soccer team in the world when playing at our best and the youth in our pipeline are going to do even better than their predecessors given the increases in the caliber of coaching
h. plasma june 17th, 2011 12:55 pm et i wonder if the journalist who wrote this knows that the us women soccer team is actually a force to reckon with.
also, there was a phenom in giussepe rossi who was born and raised in new jersey who decided to play for italy instead.
the big boss june 17th, 2011 7:25 am et not sure why there is such a emphasis on the sons and grandsons of immigrants from africa and latin america.
i'll write another article complaining that since we have so many chinese descendants in america, we should be pro at pingpong.
the us were as athletic as anyone at the world cup but lost out to well trained skill and intelligence.
the only time the united states played any possession soccer was during the first half against england.
changing the image of football will lead to changing the people who play it.
he's incredibly talented, don't get me wrong, but his arrogance is repulsive.
they need to attract foreign coaches who have very good technical nous to the clubs they already have.
as i like to say, i came for the army, and stayed for the timber.
bradley needs to go and coach like marcelo bielsa or even villas-boas should be brought in.
americans play on groomed, immaculate fields and play without passion or creativity.
the current fa was good in terms of getting the association to point where it is today but in terms of making it global powerhouse,they fall short.
i bet a ton of wide receivers and centerfielders would have made great soccer players but they had to make a choice and there is simply no money to be made playing us soccer because of the lack of commercial breaks and sponsorship opportunities.
no team in the history of the game (as far as i know) demonstrated this better than spain at the 2010 world cup.
(see link below) from the fifa site: http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/ranking/lastranking/gender=f/fullranking.html goes to show what consideration they show to women in sports.
at least in hockey people beat the crap out of each other......but in soccer all people do is fall down and pretend that they were hit to get a yellow/red card.
i guess americans just don't understand how beautiful the game is and how real competition in that sport really is exciting.
but "soccer" is mostly about talent and what we in europe call "in game events" wich make it one of the most unpredictable sports to ever be created.
the youth programs and leagues are money based and "win at all costs" to make the club and coach look good in order to attract the "best" players with money to inflate the club's accounts.
they have population of over 200 million people, most countries with large populations does well football.
my opinion... observer june 30th, 2011 7:08 pm et awful 'journalism' football has many fans in the us especially after thier good showing in the world cup.
(and brazil, we'll try not to giggle when you have a power outage during wc 2014.)
was considered a good team last wc, and in the women's is one of the best.
soccer wasn't always a soft sport...it's the current generation of diving prima-donna players, crying out for the referee's attention when they've barely been scratched, that has given it this image.
the bottom line is more people watch the world cup than all the olympics combined.
they barely get touched and roll around on the ground holding their leg when someone bumped their arm.
another tip, us coaches should start in europe as a assistant under coaches who have proved themselves.
