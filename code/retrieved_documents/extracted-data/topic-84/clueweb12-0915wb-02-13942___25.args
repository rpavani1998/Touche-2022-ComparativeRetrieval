pre-incubation count (pic) of specific bacteria should be less than 20,000.
it is in the farmers' direct financial interest to take advantage of this technology, which can deliver milk from the mammary gland of goats to the cooling tank and processing plant without ever coming in contact with barn air, with other animals or the workers.
even better yet is the monthly somatic cell count (scc) testing of each goat in the herd under the dhia program, if the somatic cell counting is not by the coulter counter.

equipment to be washed with very hot water (120 f, or higher, depending on length of exposure) after an initial lukewarm rinse after each milking a.m. and p.m., and final sanitizing solution before each milking; sanitizing rinses between milking of individual animals is of advantage when disease cases occur,
the major protein in cow milk is alpha-s-1-casein, but goat milk may differ genetically by having either none ("null" type) or much ("high" type).
also, the milk let-down effect in goats takes only a few seconds compared to one minute in cows.
progress in sight for goat milk.
goat manure should always be pellets and drier than cow manure, which is much higher in water content or normally sloppy and easily soiling the flanks and udders of cows, while goats stay normally dry and have clean flanks and udders.
no feeding of milking animals prior to milking for at least 2 hours, especially not of feeds and forages with odors.
to safeguard quality milk production, at least 5 major parameters are routinely monitored by various agencies which have jurisdiction over the production of milk through commercial channels: these five parameters need to be at optimum or it will cost the farmer money, directly or indirectly.
also, prevalent bacteria and pathogens in goat udders are often of different species than in cow udders.
this in turn indicates and may explain significant differences to cow milk in digestion by infants and patients (mack, 1953), which traditionally have been explained by the "homogenized" nature of goat milk fat.
although goat milk has a higher content of the strong smelling caproic, caprylic and capric acids in its milk fat, with good milking practices they are enclosed within the fat globule membrane.
this can eliminate a whole host of environmental odors, microbes, contaminations and assure a truly quality milk.
thus, quality production and handling of milk is a real challenge for the goat farmer as it is for the cow farmer.

thus it is high time to include in these developments the sanitarians for establishing quality standards, and the medical profession for evidence on the medical and nutritional benefits of goat milk.
inspection and lab reports dairy lab reports provide several milk quality criteria required by local, state and federal health inspectors: 1.
practices which assure safe and wholesome quality of goat milk are based on dairy cow experiences but must be confirmed for applicability to goat husbandry, not only for microbiological safety, but also for acceptability of taste and odor, which so far has been a widespread major deterrent to public acceptance of goat milk, and therefore impedes its use in human nutrition where medical reasons indicate its value.
research has established that the scc in cow milk is indicative of, although less than equal, the number of leukocytes in milk, which of course indicates subclinical or clinical mastitis.
it was determined that visibly normal goat milk had less numbers of pathogenic bacteria than cow milk under similar conditions.
less obvious is the relatively larger inside volume of the teat and gland cysterns.
many sources can be identified for off-flavors in cow milk and the same applies to goat milk: feeds (molasses, citrus pulp), forages (rape, rapeseed meal), weeds (onions, garlic), environmental odors (oil, gasoline, moldy rags, lime, cement, active bucks); normal physiology (early lactation colostrum, late lactation high salt contents, estrus, mastitis, sickness); improper handmilking procedures; improper equipment and handling (oxidation due to risers in milking pipelines, vacuum slips and searches, sun exposure, filthy clogged strainers and pipeline connections, unclean milking equipment, wash water not hot); slow air cooling instead of water cooling or refrigeration; variable temperature during storage, addition of warm milk to cold storage milk, transport in unrefrigerated containers, etc.
however, absolute scc numbers rose much higher in normal goat milk than expected from cow milk, which suggests that the goat udder responds to pathogens much more actively than cow udders do.
once cool, quality goat milk must be held in the 36 to 42o f range without interruption nor variation to maintain its quality and long shelf-life.
however, technology requires its own proper care and sanitary management, otherwise it will lead to oxidation, contamination, bacteria invasion, and loss of the quality of milk it was meant to assure.
thus, at various times of the year, dairy goats are all in early, or middle, or late stage of lactation, accentuating normal seasonal milk composition changes, that are related to stages of lactation, to estrus and low amounts of milk.

capric, caprylic and other mct have been used for treatment of malabsorption syndromes, intestinal disorders, coronary diseases, pre-mature infant nutrition, cystic fibrosis, gallstone problems, because of their unique metabolic abilities of providing energy and at the same time lowering, inhibiting and dissolving cholesterol deposits (schwabe et al., 1964; greenberger and skillman, 1969; kalser, 1971; tantibhedhyangkul and hashim, 1975, 1978).
in contrast, goat milk contains from the apocrine secretion process many non-leucocytic cell particles, that do not have dna or a nucleus as leukocytes do.
the various components of milk fat, fatty acids, differ in carbon chain length and saturation, which has nutritional and medical significance.
and all this adds even more importance to the establishment of acceptable practices and standards for quality goat milk production, which so far has been lagging behind those for dairy cows, but which require separate establishment because of the many unique physiological and metabolic characteristics of goats compared to cows (haenlein, 1980, 1987a, 1991; hinckley, 1990; kalogridou-vassiliadou et al., 1992).
often it is difficult to overcome seasonal breeding and the then common late stage of lactation in all goats, which means that at some time of the year most members of a goat herd are in late lactation with naturally high levels of salt, solids and somatic cell counts in their milk.
all these differences might give already doubts about the validity of using the same standards for evaluating milk of the two species.
