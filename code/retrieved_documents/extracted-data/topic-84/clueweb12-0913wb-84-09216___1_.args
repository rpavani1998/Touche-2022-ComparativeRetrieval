according to this researcher, all these conclusions reveal that regular consumption of goat milk – a natural food with highly beneficial nutritional characteristics - “has positive effects on mineral metabolism, recovery from ferropenic anaemia and bone mineralisation in rats.better results with goat milk results obtained in the study reveal that ferropenic anaemia and bone demineralisation caused by this pathology have a better recovery with goat milk.goats' milk was found to help with the digestive and metabolic utilization of minerals such as iron, calcium, phosphorus and magnesium.they found reason to believe that goats' milk could help prevent diseases such as anemia and bone demineralization.see also: health & medicine research carried out at the department of physiology of the university of granada has revealed that goat milk has more beneficial properties to health than cow milk.see also: health & medicine food groups colostrum research carried out at the department of physiology of the university of granada has revealed that goat milk has more beneficial properties to health than cow milk.although there is no doubt that these findings may be a base for further in depth study of the multiple health benefits of goat milk, the ugr researcher warns that “studies in humans are still required in order to confirm the findings obtained in rats and to promote goat milk consumption both in the general population and in the population affected by nutritional ferropenic anaemia and pathologies related to bone demineralisation.”among these properties it helps to prevent ferropenic anaemia (iron deficiency) and bone demineralisation (softening of the bones).to carry out this study, the metabolic balance technique has been used both in rats with experimentally induced nutritional ferropenic anaemia and in a control group of rats.javier díaz castro points out that the inclusion of goat milk with normal or double calcium content in the diet “favours digestive and metabolic utilisation of iron, calcium and phosphorus and their deposit in target organs - parts of the organism to which these minerals are preferably sent - involved in their homeostatic regulation.”due to the higher bioavailability of iron, calcium, phosphorus and magnesium, the restoration of altered haematological parameters and the better levels of parathyroid hormone (pth), a hormone that regulates the calcium balance in the organism was found in the rats that consumed this food.this project, conducted by doctor javier díaz castro and directed by professors margarita sánchez campos, mª inmaculada lópez aliaga and mª josé muñoz alférez, focuses on the comparison between the nutritional properties of goat milk and cow milk, both with normal calcium content and calcium enriched, against the bioavailability of iron, calcium, phosphorus and magnesium.goat milk vs. cow milk goats' milk is more beneficial to health than cows' milk, study suggests sciencedaily (july 31, 2007) — researchers have carried out a comparative study on the properties of goats' milk compared to those of cows' milk.in addition, and unlike observations in cow milk, its calcium enrichment does not interfere in the bioavailability of the minerals studied.”sciencedaily (july 31, 2007) — researchers have carried out a comparative study on the properties of goats' milk compared to those of cows' milk.
