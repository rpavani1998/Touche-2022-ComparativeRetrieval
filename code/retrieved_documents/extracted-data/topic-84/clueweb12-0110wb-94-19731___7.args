human casein was completely hydrolysed, compared with 96% of goat casein and 76-90% of cow casein.
furthermore, glycerol ethers are much higher in goat than in cow milk which appears to be important for the nutrition of the nursing newborn.
it appears that when fat globules are forcibly broken up by mechanical means, it allows an enzyme associated with milk fat, known as xanthine oxidase to become free and penetrate the intestinal wall.

they suggested that the higher levels of mct's (medium chain tricglycerides) in goat milk could account for the improved absorption of iron, and that the higher levels of amino acids cysteine and lysine could also be a factor - natural homogenization: goat milk is already homogenized: the natural homogenization of goat milk is, from a human health standpoint, much better than the mechanically homogenized cow milk product.
this is a key reason why goat milk is considered more easily digestible than cow milk.

how goat's milk is much healthier than cow's milk based on current research, listed below are some of the differences between goat and cow milk, which make goat milk generally the healthier choice: - composition of fat globules: one of the more significant differences from cow milk is found in the composition and structure of fat in goat milk.
