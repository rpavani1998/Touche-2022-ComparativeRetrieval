so maybe you can use this to turn the subject on its head and show adults, who want to learn other languages, why they too can learn as easy as kids.
embarrassment is a prime motivating factor for human beings (i owe this insight to marvin minsky’s the society of mind, but it was most memorably expressed by david berlinski (in black mischief, p. 129), who noted that of all emotions, from rage to depression to first love, only embarrassment can recur, decades later, with its full original intensity).
as far as i’m concerned this is totally irrelevant research,as well as being unhelpful.
she also claims that age one is where we can can no longer distinguish foreign sounds any more; “you and i can’t do that… we can discriminate the sounds of our own language, but not those of foreign languages”.
after some focused training, and sometimeseven just a few seconds of paying attention, and you’ll hear it.
in some cases, it’s harder and takes a wee bit more time, but it’s definitely not impossible.
dealing with a french waiter is nothing compared with the vicious reception in store for a child who speaks funny.”

among the worst examples include an otherwise interesting ted talk about the linguistic genius of babies – in it she shows us a bullshit graph about the “critical period” for learning a language where all hope is lostfrom age 17.
i realize that you don’t like to put yourself in situations like number 3, but living in a foreign country, i find that even as an adult, i get #3 from time to time.
i can’t imagine how many people were on the fence, but saw a video like this or read some paper where kids came out on top… in classroom learning, and decided from that to give up, even though they have many many advantages the kids don’t.
seriously ted, you need to get me to speak up on one of your stages so i can undo the damage of this previous talker, as well as destroy people’s own misconceptions.

once again, for more specifics about how i think this works on a broader scale – read my post abouthow you are not too old to learn a language.
this stuff really pisses me off as the “research” tests in a context and environment thatchildren are bound to win on anyway (such as traditional classroom learning) and doesn’t test in areas that adults would be better at.
i hope to have the ammunition to destroy this pointless demotivator.

i forget where the drunk blind man threw the dart that we have been basing this on) and consideringi myself started properly at age 21, and how many people have been sharing their own success stories with me (if you have one, make sure to share it with all of us in the fi3m forum’s success stories section – the best ones will get showcased on the blog!)
