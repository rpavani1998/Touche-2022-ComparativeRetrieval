now, i am the worst i have ever and can barely stand to be in my own skin.
i have gotten many compliments from friends and family on the condition of my facial skin, my eyes (which were typically so bloodshot that it looked as if i had been on an extended bender) and the fact that i look rested.
triludan fyi, i read in the paper that the fda has announced its intent to ban terfenadine, which is the active ingredient of triludan (anti-histamine).
that feeling of just not knowing how to put all the clues together to figure it out is so frustrating.
i have found them at all department stores: bloomingdales, nordstroms, macy's.
it really helps control the flakey, powdery areas for me.
when the last piece of the ugly scabs fell off her face with no signs of scarring, i went out and brought a lottery ticket.(didn't win, never get that kind of luck!)
added benefit: my grocery bills go *way* down.
oddly enough he has no problem with milk and that is usually a big one.
and i think the evidence built up by all you good people out there will one day give us all the answer.
and he's so sensitive now... just getting excited during play will bring welts out on his face and legs.
this really gets frustrating.
yes, it's interesting how the drug companies mix and match ingredients and come up with a wide range of prices that don't seem to correlate to what's actually included.
do keep us posted, and i wish you luck with the necessary treatments.
i think i need to sit down with him and tell him that his blunt "stop that scratching" doesn't help me stop.
i did complain but they looked at me like i was crazy.
if you have difficulty bringing up the subject, try practicing either by yourself or with a friend.
tell them to stop it, that they don't have a clue.
i understand the problem occurs in combination with certain antibiotics - including erythromycin - interesting since a lot of us have probably had the case of antibiotics and triludan!

p.s. vitamins help me a lot-- c and e date: 19 feb 1997 19:26:31 from: patsy subject: good condition i've hesitated to say anything for fear it would put a jinx on this improvement, but i chance it to say my skin is in the best condition it's been in since i first encountered eczema.
now the only breakouts she's had this month have been after being around them: two bad ones after actually patting two different dogs on 2 different occassions, and then two mild ones after being in a dog family's house and then after dog owners came to our house and held her for a while, etc.

(if required for fritters use only 8 fl oz water) fry on both sides in very lightly oiled pan and serve while hot with lemon juice and fruit sugar or syrup.
my heart also went out to rita.
i was wondering if you had been prescribed it for the eczema, as one theory is that we have an overactive immune system.
the trick is finding the next specialist to move to...
bonnie still finds balnetar to be comforting (despite its awful smell) though the oatmeal now causes some problems for her.
it was mentioned on the list that high doses could cause problems with brain function, but i think i'm too old for that to apply!date: 26 feb 1997 12:22:03 from: kim subject: more on the bath issue both our ped and derm said once a week for a bath.
they seem to make no real difference in the sense that if she's itchy she still wakes up to scratch regardless of being drugged around the clock (which i did for a week).
btw, i agree with your observation that the primary reason that we scratch is because we itch, and bad.
when i began to really not even care about it, i began dating this absolutely gorgeous girl (and its flare-ups decreased).

the author does not speak at all about children or infants so i just use common sense, ask health food store prof.
this makes it much harder for him to get at his legs, and definitely helps him not scratch.

then i saw the ad and walked out and bought it.
i was thinking of making a paste of zinc oxide and hypoallergenic brownish lipstick for covering the rash but my eczema has subsided so much that i don't even use much zinc oxide anymore.
jodi doesn't call for our help, she simply starts scratching.
i ask because my almost-3-year-old recently underwent allergy testing and was allergic to many of the things you mentioned, including milk and soy.

the one thing that helps is putting jojoba oil on it.
our doctors just put him on one anti-biotic after another, and we went along with it, not knowing we should be concerned, for a few months.
the theory is that your body knows how to heal itself, and practitioners just provide that little boost of energy to kick start the process.
the dictionary says that "colloidal" is a substance made up of tiny insoluble, nondiffusible particles that remain suspended in a medium of different matter.
as i said previously, i suffer from eczema, but i no longer even worry about myself (although i should).
i'm not doing a green leafy thing so i don't know anything about it.
be careful that he does not scratch any particular places on his body regularly though.
from many nights trying to lull bonnie into a state of deep relaxation, and teaching her to use positive imagery to overcome her impulse to scratch, i have a real sense of the helplessness and fear parents of children with eczema undergo.
we have had success with lamb, turkey, butternut squash, baby food squash, prunes, peas and spinach.
our pediatrician (who doesn't believe in this stuff, but had looked it up for another patient)
i've been giving her an antihistimine once at bedtime lately too.
each pill was $3 and i was taking 1-3 pills per day.
i shower in the morning and then cover with baby oil and pat skin dry.
when i'm red or itchy i do the "evaporation" thing which seems to help.
you can order the products straight from the company or ask your pharmacist to order them for you.
the bad part is that we had to stop all antihistamines for one week prior, which made for a horrible 7 days, so be prepared for that.
the doctors finally said daniel had eczema when he was a few months old and in the last few months we have been seeing an allergist.
i developed eczema after taking an antibiotic.
if the distortion is great enough that spectacles will no longer be adequate, the mainstay of treatment is to wear hard contact lenses (they must be hard lenses - i suspect they will want to fit you with a gas permeable hard lens).

i was kind of concerned about it being strong and burning his raw spots.

in the last couple of weeks, we have noticed a change in isaac's skin--i've even wondered if he even has eczema anymore.
the side effects can be nasty, but are rare and are more likely when it is combined with other drugs.
it cleared me up in 2 days but as i started to wean off the medication my eczema started up all over again.
turns out he probably has a viral infection (white blood cell count is up), which could be accounting for why he has so many hives lately.
he's always been sensitive, emotionally, but this physical sensitivity is striking.
if i will do what i must to my diet, i believe i can rid myself of the problems that i even have now.
at the moment i'm not using cortisone because my skin is pretty much under control except for a few small areas and the usual dry, slightly itchy skin that i don't think will ever go away (i use emollients & zinc for this).
i've also got a suspicion that it helps me tolerate dairy products better - i can't eat them all the time, but the occasional cheese etc doesn't flare me up as it used to.
it's like junk food, empty calories, you keep eating and eating and you're never full.
not knowing she was allergic to soy, we had been giving her soy toddler formula.

my wife has made a number of herbal salves and we have talked to numerous homeopathic doctors and herbalists.
in keratoconus, because of the corneal irregularity, light rays entering the eye are bent in odd ways, which blurs the image and reduces the sharpness of vision.

i took isaac to the pediatrician yesterday because he'd developed new spots on his chest--a new kind of spot he hasn't had before--not even hive-ish.
good wishes to all, and i believe that copious amounts of love for our afflicted ones and their caregivers really does help and really does matter.

there is a company called "national allergy supply, inc." 1-800-522-1448 that markets a test that you can order for $25.
we got it because the dr. said he would be a mess if he got chicken pox on top to the eczema, just a thought i know some people don't like that vaccine.
if your child is in fact actually allergic to corn it might be worth mentioning that corn products are in a zillion foods--due to corn starch and then corn syrup used as a sweetener.
i've had a look at http://www.fda.gov and found nothing on it, but that may be because i didn't know where to look and the search engine didn't work.

when i was a child i took so much medicine for my allergies, eczema and a chronic allergic bronchitis (i had a deep mucousy horrible cough which i never found out the cause of but it went away as mysteriously as it came).
the pills are taken several times a day.
i've also drank the stuff but didn't see a noticeable difference.

date: 27 feb 1997 23:51:33 from: karen subject: kim/son infections no scientific research, but my daughter's eczema and other allergies are always lots better after a beach trip.
my skin is almost completely clear now, thanks to a good vitamin regimen, and a little change in diet.
it helps to know there are other moms out there going through the same struggle.
we were initially bathing her in warm water no soap every day, but that just aggravated things.
we had a lot of luck with a rotation diet.
anyone who are interested in the pill can find a dr in canada who would contact the emergency drug release program to request for it.
jodi has not had much luck since her return from her chinese herbal treatment in china.
i would really appreciate it if you or anyone else who may know of of a cortisone that doesn't contain polypropylene glycol could let me know the name(s).

so he drinks rice milk (on his rice day, which is every other day now), fortified with calcium.
it was difficult to stop so suddenly, although i was down to feeding him only 2 or 3 times a day since i work full-time.
she then rebounded and we found a dermatologist who turned us on to the aquanil hc and cetaphyl (though we dont like the lotion and now have doubts about the cleanser) and vaseline... the vaseline alone seemed to do a lot of good, though my wife hates using a petroleum product.
i do send him a special treat when other kids are getting something special for a party or whatever.
i think the flow of perspiration allows the pores to be purged and the skin cells to be cleansed by the moisture being forced from the inside of the body out through the skin.
we ended up leaving in the middle of the course but it was too late.
my derm -- having tried everything else (in orthodox medicine) -- wants to put me on immuran, which is another immunosuppressant, but i am very wary.
i only use the vaseline at night before i go to bed because if it gets on you clothes, it's hard to get out.
her dermatologist told me that lots of his patients have the same results.
good luck with your wedding plans and remember that there is at least one other person out there who can totally empathize.
putting the shoe on the other foot may indeed strike a nerve with him.
could you tell me how they do the allergy testing on a baby -- just curious in case we need to do this.
he's always been sensitive, emotionally, but this physical sensitivity is striking.
i still have problems with all of those things, though especially to eggs, and any nuts.
eventually, we'd get his attention, and then we could talk about the challenge at hand ("it looks like your blue truck is stuck under the couch... ".
detergent didn't seem to be a big problem for that ol' ej boy because we use all free and clear all the time, anyway.
they also carry natural (unbleached, undyed) cotton sheets & blankets, even a cotton-stuffed pillow (no down).
i read their advertising on the internet and it sounds like a miracle; but then again, it is their own advertising.
they had to send blood to a special clinic.
my doctor raved about this stuff because it is weak enough to be used on the face.
my pet peeve is people who act as if the rash is my fault somehow, as if i rolled in poison ivy or something.
they will pay $140 for participation.
i have no scrupulous scientific evidence, but i have a suspicion this is down to taking valerian to aid sleep (i've taken everything and this works!) and liberal applications of tcp to deal with a recent bout of folliculitis.
and yes, i know my scratching is probably keeping him awake at night as much as it does me.
in a nutshell, you collect dust from your home and send it to john hopkins, they will analyze it and tell you what is in your home.

the great news was that he weighed 20 lbs, 15 oz--a gain of a whole pound.
there's not too much i can use that won't irritate my skin but these moisturizers definitely have helped me.
our allergist said winter is harsher because it is so cold and dry here.
for example, when isaac's skin was terrible, by age 8 or 9 months, our doctors assured us that he was "atopic," (we both had allergies as kids; my husband still has them), and that it was very likely that he'd a) be in the 40% of babies who kept their eczema for their whole lives; and b) develop athsma when he got older.
in this way i was able to keep nursing her.
they also carry natural (unbleached, undyed) cotton sheets & blankets, even a cotton-stuffed pillow (no down).

these are great moisturizers that my derm.
turns out she was allergic to that, too.
the one thing that helps is putting jojoba oil on it.
he said long term use of steroid drops (which i have been using for the infections) can eventually cause glaucoma.
my skin, however, is very sensitive to various oils (can't tolerate mineral oil formulations such as eucerin or creams with more than just a little petrolatum)
most of the designer brands include egyptian cotton.
he also recommended other vitamins but i am still in search of something he can chew or tollerate.
we've also been doing the chiropractor for 3 weeks now (twice a week) with great success.
it can do nothing but make the skin worse.
i don't know what condition my eczema will be in on the day of the wedding, so that has limited my choices of dress styles (i don't trust my back/arm eczema enough to wear a sleeveless dress with a low back, but then co-workers ask my why i would want to wear a dress with short sleeves in hot weather, etc.).
i watch what i eat (basically stay away from starch or high carbohydrate foods, citric acid, yeast, nuts, most cheeses (i'm allergic to mold) and fermented foods (including vinegar) although sweet potatoes & yams don't bother me.
she's been going to a hom eopath for 5 months.
if i don't bathe everyday my skin feels horrible.
we started eliminating lots: dairy, wheat, eggs, tomatoes, corn, chocolate, citrus, peanuts.
i have been fortunate to have doctors who always prescribe ointments rather than creams.
also, lycopodium has been successful for me.
i can't imagine why this simple concoction would be so much more effective than one of the over-the-counter creams, but it is.
after reading so much about other parents flighting their baby's eczema, i would like to voice some of my techniques i have used to help my now 20 months baby (btw, he has had eczema since birth).
evening primrose oil i use it myself (i'm 32).
sure your skin could be broken out, but it could be really good because you'll be so happy, right?
at the second visit he said she responded really well (stayed pretty loosened up--apparently it usually takes some retraining of the spine before it stays in the right place).
my derm doctor told me that scalp eczema is different from other eczema in that the scalp needs to be kept dry (not oily).
i for one will not be taking any more triludan.
i try to put these pieces together and still couldn't make sense of what i've noted.
things just can't go on this way for him.
turns out he probably has a viral infection (white blood cell count is up), which could be accounting for why he has so many hives lately.
i will never forget how important it made me feel to know that i was capable of helping someone else and also instilled a value in helping others which is a large part of my character.
i ever went to said not to bathe for too long or too often but i never listened.
it's not weeping; it just looks like patchy, dry red spots.
i'll be interested in everyone's response and start booking reservations for the summer.
the following week lets talk about ointments, creams, external aids.
i'm sure this bacteria makes the skin itch more.
eventually every time i put the cream on my eczema would burn.
daniel has broke out after wearing an outfit that was new at christmas and it was washed before he wore it...
i have been using b-v, ultravate & zinc oxide, on an informal, rotating basis to calm everything down.

he said that people without eczema would be gagging if he did that to them.
i bring this up because it highlights how complicated this whole thing is, and how important it is to have some care-givers who are sensitive to the whole picture...
this book talks about the misalignment of the spine causing psoriasis and eczema problems.
and scratching is a short-term stimulation, not the deeply fulfilling comfort of tenderness, so scratching just leads to more scratching.
after that ran out i bought some dry scalp head and shoulders.

the homeopathic md suggested vitamin therapy for mac, first and foremost the colloidal minerals.
i found it long ago, but lost it, and can't find it.
being right in the center of the couch allows me to stop jodi from falling when she loses her balance.
though jodi's e is not a result of milk protein or milk sugar, i think it's worth testing to see if your e baby is allergic to cow milk or soy by replacing regular formula with alimentum or if you nurse, try avoiding all products with milk protein or milk sugar or soy if you could.
recommended to me years ago and they are the only moisturizers i have used for a long period of time that don't irritate my skin (quite soothing actually).
they remind me of my childhood of agony and help me have sympathy for my mother who had no one to talk to about her experiences.
being part of the care-taking doesn't seem to appeal to her anymore.
you might need to look at some bread alternatives while you undertake your "starve and the eczema will go away" diet.
the trick, however (which my parents did not do with her) was to stay loving and close and be willing to put up with the tirades that would come with forcing him to stop... when i think of all the nights that that little girl lay in her bed, with socks pinned over her hands, moaning and crying, i cry.
it got to a point where he avoided seeing her at all, simply to keep her from harassing him about it.
you know, i am really wondering if it's not (also) due to the homeopathic remedy.
i am not sure if you can do this with a toddler but vitamin c gives me a lot of relief.
i was going to try grinding some oatmeal in the food processor, but maybe i won't go through the bother.
also said that they just found out that head & shoulders is just as effective as the nizorol shampoo that he prescribed for me the last time i was there... interesting.
we are sleeping now though and she looks great so whatever the reason, i'm thrilled!
it makes my skin less dry, and seems to make the itching less.
the last time i had a flare up was 2 weeks before i gave birth to juliet, my older one.
old (brian) woke up at 4 a.m. with bloody socks (which he had pulled off his hands).
now the only breakouts she's had this month have been after being around them: two bad ones after actually patting two different dogs on 2 different occassions, and then two mild ones after being in a dog family's house and then after dog owners came to our house and held her for a while, etc.
i had that patch test (t.r.u.e. i believe) done twice and it showed nothing.
everybody i know who's gotten married has worried about their wedding being ruined by something.
they love it 'cos the veggies are slightly sweet.
i use vitamin e oil right after i shower, while my skin is still wet (i just kind of drip dry and let the oil dry with my skin, as towels irritate me).
but if i could have gotten over the hurt from his manner, and enlisted my husband's help in figuring out a new diet (instead of feeling defensive because he agreed with the guy's recommendation), it probably would have helped isaac.
for the full text story, see http://www.merc.com/stories/cgi/story.cgi?id=1693630-6ca when people said don't scratch, all it has ever done is made me feel guilty about it, like if i had enough will-power, i could control myself.
but maybe the load was too big and didn't get rinsed thoroughly.
it cost $400.00 each time too.
jodi has had no blows to her head or trauma to her spine; couldn't think of anything that could cause any neurotoxin or any malnutrition.
we use topical steroid creams when he gets real bad only about once or twice every couple of weeks but they scare me.
finishing the sun bathing and/or sauna sessions with cool/cold showers water seems to make a big difference in the amount of benefit accomplised, infection reduced, and increased comfort level achieved.
as i understand it, this isn't technically an "allergy"--that word is saved for reactions that involve his immune system.
i was very self-conscious about it.
so i resorted to benadryl for a few nights as a crutch to help break the cycle.
eventually, we'd get his attention, and then we could talk about the challenge at hand ("it looks like your blue truck is stuck under the couch... ".
jodi's diagnosis was toxins in the blood.
my mother and i have gone back over my highs and lows with it and the relationship to the homes that we lived in.
when i was pregnant, my hormones went crazy (of course!), and so did my eczema.
being right in the center of the couch allows me to stop jodi from falling when she loses her balance.
his legs and arms were still scratched up because of wearing shorts and such---but face wasn't as bad..
i notice that when i wash jodi's hair everyday, her e clears up on her scalp.
it's main ingredient is iodine.
are you the one that said earler that yams are not in the nightshade family, he eats them a lot (not sweet potatoes).date: 3 feb 1997 16:02:11 from: marilyn subject: recipe, pls/red wine i have been a vegetarian, and occasional vegan, for years.
for those of us who have often wished we could go out with a paper bag over our heads (and for everyone else, too), i heartily recommend reading lucy grealy's book autobiography of a face -- her story of growing up with a facial deformity.
i found out when bonnie was 3 months old that she was suffering from allergic eczema.
when allergy testing showed a mild reaction to potatoes, we took her off of that favourite food and her skin cleared up considerably.
i believe diet is a major factor, as well as regular bathing.
i had very few reactions to foods, just swordfish.
i hope your patch test shows something.
i have to say, *all* who saw it didn't flinch and seemed quite at ease with it.
ultimately, he has managed to lose much of the weight (and she's quite proud of him for it!), but it had nothing to do with her harassment and everything to do with finding a way to do it that he could live with.
the formula he is recommending is the most expensive stuff on the market.
i would say he is ok now - at least he is not bloody in the morning - he still has his eczema on his hand/foot.
for dave, however, understand that this is a very treatable eye condition.
there is a company called "national allergy supply, inc." 1-800-522-1448 that markets a test that you can order for $25.
first of all, we find eczema on different parts of the body signifies different causes.
daniel's skin was better during the summer.
for this reason, it's recalled from the market.
but no problems so far (she had several ear infections until she was two but now can blow her nose and has never has another).
pick a time when there are no other distractions and he can give you his full attention.
that way they both get the attention they need.
unlike manual breast pumps, the industrial pump is very gentle on your skin and does the job really quickly.
so it's good for everyday- around-town use.
from: debbie subject: non-irritating detergent i use bold free with an extra rinse cycle.
there are foods katie avoids because they "make her tongue tingle" but no severe reactions have surfaced.
said she was really, really tight in the shoulder blade area, also has said she is making incredible progress--except for one session where he said she went downhill a bit.
i know doctors can sometimes be pretty blithe about their recommendations, not thinking through the whole picture and just concentrating on fixing the portion of the problem you've presented them with...
but if i could have gotten over the hurt from his manner, and enlisted my husband's help in figuring out a new diet (instead of feeling defensive because he agreed with the guy's recommendation), it probably would have helped isaac.
i am staying away from wheat, dairy and eggs, too, but here is my cereal.
i think that the same thing happened to isaac--i was drinking lots of milk, and eating lots of peanut butter, when i was breastfeeding him, and i was making him sick.
terfenadine may increase the sedative effect of antidepressants, sleeping pills and antipsychotics, whilst antidepressants increase the chance of abnormal heart rhythms.
she smiled a lot and interacted with people around her.
when i can allow myself to really experience the feelings, i can tell that the comforting sensation of a hand rubbing my back is something i never got enough of as an infant/child.
in addition to this, we've once again been using a slight amount of topical cortisone behind the knees (knees and neck often keep her itching all night) and a dose of antihistamine.
the recipes are pretty generic, and include lots of canned foods, frozen juices, and vegetables (of course)...
most people really are not malicious, they simply do not know.

when my mum suggested something with a low back or no sleeves, i just said, "well, i don't know how my skin will feel that day, and i'd be happier in a different dress."
he seems to know what he's talking about, i think he's scared of overwhelming us though with too much information.
i use the periactin when he has a bad flare up, it does help.
sue and faith-----our first dr. said of daniel's bad skin----he just has eczema, like his dad.
since my level was low they thought that it may have had an effect on my hormones and adrenals.
sometimes i think that my eczema is really everyone else's problem nearly as much as it is mine because they have to look at it -- and on your wedding day, it's their tough luck.
when i was young, the ocean was wonderful for my skin.
i think the midnight scratch-fests and constant irritation sapped my energy reserves over the years.
obviously he hasn't ever had it -- because if he had, he would know it's nothing to joke about!
when i was young my dr said that the skin could absorb it better.
at the moment i'm not using cortisone because my skin is pretty much under control except for a few small areas and the usual dry, slightly itchy skin that i don't think will ever go away (i use emollients & zinc for this).
i find that prednisone works for me less and less and sometimes i don't get the maximum relief until after i have been off it for a while.
this game keeps both girls happy and they both have my attention.
i switch off with cortisones, zinc oxide ointment and zinc pyrithione 2%.
the more you care about it, the more others will care about it.
i just decided to try it because it was one that i'd never tried and it didn't contain lanolin.
when i am nervous or hot, it is much worse and if i sweat, i feel like i will die.
e. i also stopped drinking milk myself when i resumed breast feeding.
the last time i went dancing, one of my partners backed away when he felt my hands (strategically bandaged!) and said "i have to ask... is that contageous?"
i used to take it religiously and i will probably start that again because i think it's helpful.
ii know there are other things one could do, involving minerals and vitamins.
as for the other routine stuff, i also use tide free, double rinse... hot water bedding... no antibiotics (she either had a bad reaction to keflex at 7 mos.
well, now that you mention it, yes, at one time i *did* use my teeth to scratch myself, and did so quite regularly up until about a year ago (when i started trying to take care of the stuff... by simply not scratching even though it about drove me out of my mind, as well as experiments with vitamin supplements.
all i can find about eucerit is that it's a special form of lanolin/wool wax alcohol.
the other day my husband was in restaurant with daniel and a man gave him his card and recommended trying enzymes.
it is scented and full of those strange chemicals.
if lace isn't good for some reason, then experiment with other light materials to cover up yet be cool.
it's weird but with me everything is connected; all stresses on my body effect the eczema.
the allergist says daniel will most likely outgrow the food allergies all but eggs and peanuts, but by the time he is 4 or 5 will become allergic to airborne allergins.
does anyone know of a good remedy for an itchy, flaky, scabby eczema scalp that won't irritate my skin and that doesn't stink like tar?date: 6 feb 1997 17:04:07 from: gary subject: scalp i have found success with long's drugs scalp itch treatment lotion.
up til then i'd been told that she was just "a cranky baby" and that she had a bad "heat rash".
the leaves i puree and mix with her rice and meat.
i have pored over medical journals, written to researchers, and still can't find anyone who will say what/if the negative side effects of evening primrose oil are.
sometimes i just feel totally overwhelmed with the whole situation.
of course i monitored my diet carefully and watched katie for any reaction.
our dr. never said nursing caused e (i nursed just 5 and 1/2 mos) but daniel was always broke out.
so, kim, the disks aren't effective for the real life dirt of active families.
red wine is a problem, white wine much less, and any alchoholic beverage has some irritation.
eating lots of peanut butter, when i was breastfeeding him, and i was making him sick.
i have tried several of the supplements and creams suggested by this list, and my condition has improved considerably.
i discovered this while using desowen lotion- after using it on my face & other areas of my body for over a year.
my problem is that i cannot financially afford the dosage that it asks.
you might ask your pharmacist if s/he can order it; my dermatologist suggested it to me.
we are trying to help him as best we can right now, but i also believe in prayer.
well, this anti-bacterial lotion really makes my hands break out bad!!!
one of my sisters still had braces on her teeth when she got married, and i remember how upset she was, moaning about how the photos were going to be terrible, practicing smiling without showing her teeth, etc.
it comes as powder in a capsule, so it was easy to give him--just sprinkled it on his applesauce.
he is 16 months old and has been itchy since just a couple of weeks old.
the condition of her spine always coincides with the state of her eczema.
i've just started her on flax seed oil, which is kind of similar to evening primrose oil.
the trick is finding the next specialist to move to...
so when we have the attention for it, we have sessions where we lovingly, but physically, restrain him from scratching.
i hope the chiropractor etc. helps to prevent the eczema.
he read me the riot act about all the antibiotics from last year, but what is a mom to do you work with what you have till you find something better.
if not, you could put soy or rice milk in it, as you would with oatmeal.
the guy had a terrible "bedside manner," and i was so pissed off at his seeming disregard for what *i* needed that i didn't follow his advice.
dhea, from what i understand, is a hormone regulator that everyone has some level of in their bodies.
you are right to remember that you don't know how your skin will be that day.
our theory is that his eczema/scratching is in part his way of dealing with emotional challenges, and that he scratches because it distracts him from the confusion/fear/pain he's feeling about something in his life.
i've been noticing a 3 day cycle to the "bad" times.
i'm sorry to hear about mac's illness.
so i wash as much as i can.
fortunately, i was self indulgent that day and bought them anyway (about $50 a sheet).
good luck, and let us know how things go.
anyway, i just wanted to know if anyone can empathize with what i'm feeling.
once you are prepared with a simple comeback, you will be more relaxed and able to enjoy dress hunting and also the big day.
sorry to hear mac got so sick, i know how scary that is last winter.
i would put money on a bet that in the next twenty years, they will find that antibiotics and steroids contribute to the progression from eczema to athsma...
so i would recommend being up front with someone like a dressmaker or sales clerk -- their job is to help you find a dress to let the inner beauty shine through, and i expect they will all have good suggestions for your outer looks as well if you let them know what you're up against.
i also wanted to comment on the food allergy issue... for those of you who have kids who are "allergic to everything," or for whom it seems that way.
when my mum suggested something with a low back or no sleeves, i just said, "well, i don't know how my skin will feel that day, and i'd be happier in a different dress."
i do rub brian's back sometimes, but he scratches his head the most, so i try to rub his head (and massage with baby oil) for him whenever i catch him scratching.
i used to visit my sister's house practically daily.
fortunately i found a dress that i loved on the first visit.
they plugged him full of medications, antibiotics, drugs, drugs, drugs.
people are finding the right combinations of vitamins, diets, allergen avoidance, emotional assistance, etc., and are actually getting better.
date: 22 feb 1997 03:15:42 from: debi subject: e baby foods i have been fortunate to work with a nutritionist who has provided me with lists of foods to test.
there are still mild patchy outbreaks from time to time, but it's not nearly as bad as it was.
i am staying away from wheat, dairy and eggs, too, but here is my cereal.
the derm told me to see how he is after one week off breastmilk, and if it's not better, he would need to have allergy tests done.
thanks be to god that there are actually some beautiful females my age out there who don't care that much about looks (and subsequently, will date me).
we had to pull him out of a group daycare setting because his skin got so bad there.
did i tell you that i also broke down when julia was sick with croup 2 weeks ago, and took her to a derm.
jodi developed full body contact dermatitis.
it's also alot easier than trying to get the oil out of the softgels, for babies who can't yet take pills.
but phosphorus is doing really well against it so far.
except putting alpha-keri bath stuff is like lighting a match next to me.
much of this regimen is not simply to help the eczema, but to help my health in general (i don't eat what i should).
if the fda has found something new i'd certainly like to know.
the following is a list of your good foods: also, i go to acupuncture 1 x per month.
why not have a theme for your wedding then you can wear a dress that covers you and just say you like "traditional" or whatever.
footnote: i feel much better on a vegan regime, but don't use it frequently.
i find that the best thing for me from my wife is that she just accept that i am constantly in motion touching here and scratching there.
i think the leaky guy syndrome is one example of a cause--if substances are leaking into the wrong body cavities and causing problems, then the body will manifest this problem with eczema, maybe.
i takes the burn out of my skin and also seems to promote the healing.
my dermatologist asked me to stop nursing last week asap ...
i tried them anyway, and i have had great success.
any way, i wanted to get some feedback from the group.
the only soap she could use was glycerin, clear, unscented.
i like having the communication even if it is 2:00 a.m.
he then tested positive to potatoes and soy, but his last test came up negative.
remembers when he was a toddler that he use to take a receiving blanket and wrap it around his arms so he wouldn't scratch too hard.
you made it much easier to get through the day.
he will get better on his own.
i can't promise they'll help you, but they seem to have done the trick for me.
instead of that red, raised skin, he gets welts.
sometimes this condition makes me feel so alone in the world and it is nice to know that there are others that can empathize.
from: debi subject: e baby foods i have been fortunate to work with a nutritionist who has provided me with lists of foods to test.
i ask because my almost-3-year-old recently underwent allergy testing and was allergic to many of the things you mentioned, including milk and soy.
wendy, sorry to hear about your scratching frenzy last week.
we might start this up again, and have a referral to someone with a good reputation.
i removed almost everything from her diet except rice, pears, apples, sweet potatoes, squash.
i noticed that when i thought my eczema was some horrible, demonic thing, i rarely if ever dated (and incidentally, it flared up more!).
she agreed, and the whole process was much more low- key than i expected (no attempts on her part to find the "cause" of my e., etc.).
he wanted to "talk and play" so it must not have been as painful as it looked.
the sun is shining and i'm going out to take a walk.
i have been told that prick test doesn't alway tell the whole story till a child is atleast 5 years.
my friend rubbed my back yesterday and that was wonderful.
spray that it started to clear up and stop itching.
my daughter sent me some 2oz sizes of stuff called purell instant hand sanitizer: "kills 99.9% of most common disease-causing germs within 15 seconds".
date: 11 feb 1997 14:25:37 from: royce subject: polypropylene glycol i also thought that polypropylene glycol was not used in ointments but my dr. was going through all his little sample boxes and found that every one of them contained that ingredient.
i'd say that eczema will be the least of your problems once you're married, but then i'm divorced so my outlook might be a shade jaded!
many plants, trees, dust and molds had catastrophic reactions.
so if you need it for anti-bacterial cleansing i would not use it daily if you can avoid it.
i tried a 100% pure glycerin soap and had a reaction.
he placed him on a special diet along with the anti histamine (periactin).
i am throwing it out as i have not seen seafood being mentioned here.
it comes as powder in a capsule, so it was easy to give him--just sprinkled it on his applesauce.
now, of course, they attribute his improvement to pure aging--he "grew out of it."
i was on prednisone during late pregnancy when i just couldn't stand it anymore.
my second pet peeve is people who with all the authority in the world announce that it is stress-related.
if you were somehow allergic to glycine, eczema would be the least of your problems, since glycine is in virtually every protein in your body.
though jodi's e is not a result of milk protein or milk sugar, i think it's worth testing to see if your e baby is allergic to cow milk or soy by replacing regular formula with alimentum or if you nurse, try avoiding all products with milk protein or milk sugar or soy if you could.
sometimes i can skip one day but only when my skin is in good condition.
she was raw, red, oozing, bleeding on her face and it started spreading more to neck, wrists, legs, and elbows.
the theory is that your body knows how to heal itself, and practitioners just provide that little boost of energy to kick start the process.
for example, when isaac's skin was terrible, by age 8 or 9 months, our doctors assured us that he was "atopic," (we both had allergies as kids; my husband still has them), and that it was very likely that he'd a) be in the 40% of babies who kept their eczema for their whole lives; and b) develop athsma when he got older.
hello again i am finding all this very interesting because all these children sound just like my son daniel.
the dr checked her pulse, skin, tongue etc every day and changed the herbal mix as needed.
i have already sent away for mailings on how daniel can cope with all this growing up.
i'm back to eczema on my legs only.
our daughter hated the antibiotic and barely tolerated the liquid prednisone, but after five days it was all cleared up.
i did have the chance to whisk her off to a portrait studio on her best day--so i had some luck there.
he seems to know what he's talking about, i think he's scared of overwhelming us though with too much information.
well, the benefit from the chinese herbal treatment seems to give way to a series of countered epidsodes .
great suggestions for the more gourmet palate... and lots of sauce and stock recommendations.
they carry many egyptian cotton things, and i think sheets are on that list.
i would recommend that you bathe him very often in warm water (hot water will irritate the skin usually, and cold is unbearable) during the summer, as the dirt irritates the skin, causing itching.
when my eczema is really active, the medicine, while it does help, doesn't calm it down the way it looks right now.
a web search should yield more information than i can give you off the top of my head.
she found a vegetable vaseline substitute, and it works though it must be used more often.
also, i had to take a blood test once a month to make sure that kidneys were ok.
daniel did look alot more clear last summer.
in your list of foods you mentioned carrots, not in our camp.
i have renewed energy, do not scratch at night and am not experiencing any itching that i cannot easily resist.
royce subject: - egyptian cotton sheets flannel sheets seem softer to the touch but they still make me a little itchy.
there are a ton of chiros everywhere, as opposed to the amount of pedi gi's, for example.
yes, we use vaseline on our daughter's skin.
one thing i find interesting about these products is that they are made with a petroleum fraction and i can't tolerate petroleum itself.
i was trying to eat nutritious snacks to keep my weight up -- i kept losing weight while nursing.
wash all his bedding in superhot water once a week, including his stuffed animals, pillow, and bumpers.
as i understand it, this isn't technically an "allergy"--that word is saved for reactions that involve his immune system.
and i didn't expect much more since we already got julia under control once ourselves.
we went through a bottle of the stuff, but never noticed any change, and quit.
what ever dress or medication you choose, i think it is wise to have one stock phrase for those who comment on your skin.
corneal transplantation is only needed if the cornea is so badly deformed that it is impossible to fit a contact lens, or if there is scarring due to the keratoconus that obscures the central vision - that is clearly the minority of patients.
two or three days a month i spend raging around my house, my mind going 100 miles an hour, going over and over and over my notes, articles, the labels of foods and vitamins, just trying to find the thing i missed that will make the whole picture make sense.
i began these products for a week and then again attempted to wean from prednisone.
i have caught up on literally years of sleep.
so, she had 9 clearing days (with only 2 actual days of "looking" clear since she started out as mess), then went downhill for 3 days (but not too bad at all really) and now has been going back uphill for the last 3 days.
after investing a million dollars and hours in vitamins, blood tests and every other possible natural cure, i think they are it.
he seemed to be happy that i figured out (or at lease i think i figured out) one of the culprits but he also seemed a little embarrassed (or maybe even mad).
also, with wedding dress-shopping in particular, there may be emotional baggage aggravating the e. (been there!).
we were trying aveeno for our daughter's flare ups, as a substitute for cortisone, and trying a vegetable based vaseline-like product for a moisture barrier.
the only thing jodi has benefited from is chinese herbal treatment.
i use them every day on any affected areas and it seems to help it heal and keep it from coming back.
he's the author that speaks about leaky gut... and says along with it there seems to be a little trouble with elimination (recommends enemas or high colonics on a fairly regular basis) and talks about specific spinal misalignments (different ones for psoriasis vs. eczema) and specific recommendations for diet and supplements and topical agents.
steroids scare me alot and we are trying all new things we've been reading about here.
though it is not one of the most pleasant things in the world, it is not as bad for the skin in my opinion as just plain scratching.
not easy for a control freak like me.
after sending my posting about ointments vs. creams, i got that uncertain feeling and went to check my elocon tube.
she was absolutely miserable.
my pet peeve is people who act as if the rash is my fault somehow, as if i rolled in poison ivy or something.
i also may note that the lecithin may be causing more harm than good (i am experimenting with it).
the anticholinergic effects of terfandine may be increased by drgus which have anticholinergic effects.
but the sea is great (after i've plucked up enough courage to go in there, with everyone looking at my legs like they're leprous).
last time i had a problem was in the fall when i had a scare with my mammogram.
also, i am on an anti detergent kick, i remember kaye was going to try those disks to use in the washing machine.
i takes the burn out of my skin and also seems to promote the healing.
it looked alot nicer and that was before we learned of his food allergies.
my herbalist pals tell me milk thistle supports and repairs the liver.
allow the kids to bring their natural playfulness into the experience.
said she was really, really tight in the shoulder blade area, also has said she is making incredible progress--except for one session where he said she went downhill a bit.
a lot of my co-workers cannot use it either and they don't have eczema.
b-v is a cream, while ultraval is an ointment, kind of like vaseline.
everybody i know who's gotten married has worried about their wedding being ruined by something.
now it doesn't take a rocket scientist to at least suspect it.
just maybe it will make him be a leader (not wanting to be like everybody else) and that will be a big plus in the years to come.
it's greasier than vaseline.
recent research has shown that when combined, these two medications can cause fatal changes in heart rhythm.
i noticed that when i thought my eczema was some horrible, demonic thing, i rarely if ever dated (and incidentally, it flared up more!).
frankly, one chronic, poorly-understood medical condition is plenty; i didn't need the eczema on top of the repetitive strain injury problems i already have.
the herb works very well for my wife ( i think she is more or less cured) but we have not yet dared give it to my son (because of his age ).
i understand my mom always has another cause for my son's eczema and if he has skin out for people to see they think i let him get a sunburn, i want to say, mind your own business we are doing the best we can.
we've also been doing the chiropractor for 3 weeks now (twice a week) with great success.
very utilitarian, well tested recipes... but this and the leneman book use higher fat ingredients, and lots of nuts.
it's fragrance free and has a nice greasy feel.
anyway, it is true what you said that you can never tell how bad it is going to be.
date: 4 feb 1997 13:27:10 from: royce subject: childhood eczema i am so happy to hear that you're trying not to use drugs on your daughter.
i know things will get easier when juliet has passed her terrible two and jodi's immune system gets stronger.
all i know is jodi likes cool and well ventilated places like our home.
i am already on an extensive vitamin/mineral program, but wondered if anyone had strong feelings about or experience with the glandulars.
but i often feel we will find one day that eczema is just the skin's way of reacting to a number of things the body doesn't like and has no consistent cause.
so far i've experimented with eucerin, jergen's dual healing, lubriderm, and shi kai, all because i was able to get sample sizes of them.
has eczema on his face, scalp, and a few spots on his body.
all were bought at a chemist or pharmacy.
i've used aloe vera topically and have found its soothing & healing properties to be helpful.
eliminated all known allergens, and also several that the dermatologist suggested we stay away from "just in case".
no really big deal, as meat is ok.
he read me the riot act about all the antibiotics from last year, but what is a mom to do you work with what you have till you find something better.
hi susan, i am also new to the list and felt very moved by your post.
from: debi subject: to: e baby moms i feel overwhelmed, there are quite a few of us who have babies with severe e. debbie, rita, jolie, karen and more.
however, i use them occasionally now that she goes a week at a time with no new breakouts, etc.
my preference is only because the cream is a little less "messier".
we saw two different ones, and stopped after he became very scared of the second one (her adjustments hurt him).
and she nurses, so i changed my diet even more--no dairy, wheat, peanut butter, potatoes, or oatmeal.
but i know they are usually used as the steamed veggies to go with soup noodles.
fry sliced mush leftovers on a greased griddle to make "pancakes".
but for those like me who can't get to a beach regularly, this could be a substitute.
date: 20 feb 1997 10:46:25 from: kim subject: a newcomer when my son was tested at 9 months it was a prick test of tiny pins (six i think) on a base that was pressed onto his back.
the recipes in this one are a collection from various chefs -- they can be quite elaborate, but are very good.
so, it turns out that diprobase, cost gbp 12.50 for 500g contains exactly the same ingredients (possibly in different proportions, admittedly) as aqueous cream, cost gbp 2.50 for 500g.
the doctor just wanted to put me on stronger steroids.
after 10 days, i tried to wean off and had a return flare as bad as the first.
i don't give her the drop very often since her appetite is mostly good.
my son reacts strongly to smoke filled rooms and antique stores, this is in addition to his food intollerances.
and the omission of oils from these lotions may help explain their effectiveness in my case.
i read one research paper that recommended 500 mg 3x per day for eczema, psoriasis, herpes, shingles and got very good results.
daniel has broke out after wearing an outfit that was new at christmas and it was washed before he wore it...
it has to be quick&easy, so that i can bake a bunch and freeze them in for use instead of bread.
actually what i've used instead with similar results is: take a piece of cheesecloth, put oatmeal (i used organic when i could) in it and tie it up tight.
even the cold water/damp sheet didn't work, and it usually does.
it feels soothing though and helps with the itch, especially on my face.
my doctor put me on prednisone which almost entirely cleared my skin within 2 days (problem: pred.
i don't want to always be trying to control this and never hunting for why it happens in the first place.
one thing i wish for is a vaccine for e. - i really hope they come up with something soon.
my heart goes out to all of you who have shared here.
our mattresses are wrapped and cleaned often.
i think it helps regulate my cycle (i used to have a very irregular menstrual cycle & bad pms).
date: 12 feb 1997 09:22:21 from: nancy subject: happy to be back i've been reading your posts for a couple of months and was surprised to see that there is a link between asthma, allergy, stomach problems and eczema.
from: donna subject: colloidal oatmeal a colloidal 'solution' is not a solution in the true sense, as the particles are in fact suspended in the liquid, and not dissolved -- but the particles are so tiny that it seems to dissolve.
i keep telling myself things could be lots worse, though.
nizoral did help for a while, but then stopped working.
but my doctor says that it's not possible (i think it's possible for me to be allergic to anything).
sometimes we even had to carry her because her skin was so bad that if she walked, scabs would break open and she'd bleed.
i would also recommend that when you clean him, clean him thoroughly.
i would also like to hear about the results of uva.

it's just that jodi and her eczema gets more attention at times.
i don't know their names in english since they are indigenous in china.
it is not the most pleasant thing in the world, especially if you date fairly regularly.
now melt that over some corn flakes -- i think i could well live on that for a month...
the little bit of itchy, flaky eczema that i had left was cleared up using the shampoo.
unfortunately, for some reason it never occurred to me that my daughter could be allergic to soy, so i never eliminated that, which has turned out to be the major culprit in her case.
i used to take at least one oatmeal bath a day and it was the only time i felt comfortable in my skin.
i still struggle with that one, because right after isaac was born, we took him to a naturopath who told me i should immediately take all dairy, corn, wheat, and peanuts from my diet, as long asi was nursing him.
the aveeno anti itch cream with calamine worked somewhat but the aveeno lotion caused her skin to get worse...
the liter bottle (green front) is sold at approx usd 16.- in the pharmacy.
now daniel is allergic to peanuts, but not dairy.
anybody use just sesame oil or anything like that.
fortunately, i was self indulgent that day and bought them anyway (about $50 a sheet).
in fact, i usually add a bit more glycerin to it.
since the 2nd visit she's been eating better again.
by the time i've been in for a week, my legs look almost normal.
we also think that his eczema got triggered by a series of antibiotics that he was on to fight ear infections that began at about 5 months.
my pharmacist says that emulsifying wax contains cetostearyl alcohol and sodium lauryl sulphate (and some purified water).date: 1 feb 1997 09:46:11 from: debbie subject: childhood eczema citrus is a common allergen.
our first naturopath recommended that we give isaac pancreatic enzymes.
recently, when i ran out of hydrocortizone cream i put this on my face and it acted much more effectively there than the cream--practically the "magic bullet" for my facial eczema.
if needed, however, corneal transplantation for keratoconus carries about a 90%-ish success rate - it is one of the diseases that we do pretty well with when performing transplants.
our building is 5 years old.
sometimes we even had to carry her because her skin was so bad that if she walked, scabs would break open and she'd bleed.
i notice that when i wash jodi's hair everyday, her e clears up on her scalp.
my daughter (age 2-1/2) has eczema and complete strangers are always asking questions about it, so i can empthasize with your self-consciousness.
i tried it on a few items; many of the "official" ones (eucerin, lac-hydrin, aveeno, eurax etc.) are there, but the "alternative" health-food store ones (simicort, herpacine) are not.
but since she hates lying on her belly or being in the crawling position, there are times she can't find anything to support herself to move around.
it's a glutinous rice cake that you can bake in the oven; makes a hearty, sticky bun with a crust.
the first suggested vitamins he will not chew.
i do manage to keep it under control (it's always worse during winter and during certain times of the month), but i *can't stand* the looks of consternation on my relatives' faces when they see it.
i use lubriderm as a moisturizer (my doctor's suggestion) and clotriminazole 1% (i got that tip here).
and when we'd stop giving it to him, about two weeks later, he'd start to get worse.
when you get overwhelmed, post another message like you did, that's what we're here for.
rashes usually hide things like scars so when i notice one, i'm happy because it means my skin is doing well!
she's doing great: clearing completely on some days.
i still have problems with all of those things, though especially to eggs, and any nuts.
what ever dress or medication you choose, i think it is wise to have one stock phrase for those who comment on your skin.
try to set up the situation so that you have lots of little reminders that you're happy to be taking this step.
never had any thrush or any sign of candida, no ear infection or use of antibiotic .
sue - though the viral attack started a month ago, jodi still has a few scattered blister-like rashes broke out on her skin here and there.
the rest of his body is totally free of eczema now (big hooray with lac-hydrin 5), but his scalp is a mess of dandruff.
i'm pissed that my doctor actually caused part of the problem.
so, she had 9 clearing days (with only 2 actual days of "looking" clear since she started out as mess), then went downhill for 3 days (but not too bad at all really) and now has been going back uphill for the last 3 days.
we prefer this to scratching, but we occasionally try to break this one up, too, just to make sure he isn't "going away" to deal with his problem by himself.
the pharmacist suggested switching to a hydrocorozone mix with a cetaphil base.
i've tried dhs zinc pyrithione shampoo, nizorol shampoo, tar shampoos & derma smooth (which is an oil based cortisone solution which, in the past, has helped the eczema on my skin).
the sun is shining and i'm going out to take a walk.
we still might have to do ear tubes at some point, but his ears are no worse than they were when he was on the antibiotics.
they include the mcdougall program, and the mcdougall program for maximum weight loss, and at least 2 books of recipe collections.
we have to become educated consumers and unfortunately waste time investigating these ingredients to see if there are actually cheaper sources for the same stuff.
i don't want to always be trying to control this and never hunting for why it happens in the first place.
i tried primrose oil along time ago and don't remember that it helped much but since your post, i think i will try it again.
she agreed, and the whole process was much more low- key than i expected (no attempts on her part to find the "cause" of my e., etc.).

now, i am the worst i have ever and can barely stand to be in my own skin.

my dermatologist doesn't think that my e. is allergy-related, but i do know that textile manufacturers treat fabrics with a number of chemicals, including formaldehyde, which probably don't do much for us e. sufferers!

at first we didn't have much ammunition--we just tried to talk them out of prescribing antibiotics--but eventually we started seeing specialists, and got better information...
.. it will be interesting to find out what exactly he's allergic to.
thanks for your point of view re: touching, physical contact.
i expect he would not only not find it likely to help him, but he'd find it debilitating.
he yells, cries, kicks, and struggles, but we calmly hold him, encourage him to keep going in his crying and kicking, and assure him that he's doing the right thing, we love him, and we'll help him through this.
it would almost appear to me that i mark significant improvements on a weekly basis... especially this last 3 weeks.

so i don't think the drying effect is real important for me) but it might help you to get away from the oily meds.
the clear lotion is a mineral and jojoba type oil (with petroleum fraction & something else - sorry i don't have the bottle here) which i am surprised i can tolerate because many people claim mineral oil is no good.

getting his eye contact during this is tough, but important.
it gently repositions any dysfunctions in your body, and re-aligns the cranial bones to their correct position.
my homeo-doc told me that - like mint - it just happened to be particularly potent and would overwhelm any less robust substance.
just hours after my milk diet began, she again displayed serious skin disruptions.
he never gave me any problems going back and forth from breast and bottle.
debbie, thanks for the reply, he was a little worse this a.m. with lots of itching in the night, even spots that don't look bad, the back of his knees always itch at night.
this product is not seen as much as the standard "all" but i am sure if you ask your store manager to order it he/she would, as it sells easily.
again, it's only available by prescription through the emergency drug release program.
i tried it on a hunch after having dealt with all the useless salves and ointments the md had prescribed.
i just give her a little bit of prunes every day.
our furnishings are either leather or wood, no fabrics, drapes nor carpets.
i am not sure if you can do this with a toddler but vitamin c gives me a lot of relief.
i can also communicate successful products with an adult, the baby can't tell me if i am helping him!date: 27 feb 1997 05:30:31 from: brigit subject:
it's easy to put so much energy into how it looks, comparing it to how other people's skin looks, without any idea of what is the "normal" way for their skin to look.
even the water from the shower burned.
we are very interested in successes with various natural products.
after sending my posting about ointments vs. creams, i got that uncertain feeling and went to check my elocon tube.
as i said before, i can't see why this formula should work when tubes of cortisone ointments and creams don't, but it does.
now he wakes up about once a night for a water bottle.
i guess kind of a softer form of scratching since a 16 mo old can't understand softer.
i buy it in 16oz. bottles and put a small squeeze bottle of it and mineral oil half and half in the shower.
sometimes when he is scratching alot i lay him across my lap and rub his back and down his legs.
i only hope that isaac's viral infection is not going to get as ugly as jodi's.
i spoke to his doctor's office this morning, and they said to apply neosporin 3 times today, and if it's not much better by tomorrow, bring him in.
i literally felt normal for the first time since i got eczema at 13 yrs old.
felt great all through pregnancy, needed no medication or had no complications at all.
i also may note that the lecithin may be causing more harm than good (i am experimenting with it).
i don't think that anyone believes that eczema or asthma is caused by just one thing, so it's really hard to ever wipe out the root cause.
emulsifying wax i once asked a pharmacist and he looked it up and decided diprobase and aqueous cream were the same, possibly whipped up to a slightly different consistency.
i really attribute this to noticing her skin condition on the day she was born, recognizing the similarity and acting on it, in spite of the well-meaning advice of my care-givers.
i really do believe the drugs just suppress the immune system and i want her immune system to find its on way to heal itself, so i don't want to overuse them.
he didn't realize it but that made me even more self-conscious than i already am.
i have never had eczema, but some of my insights that i use to help isaac come from growing up with a younger sister who was very debilitated by it.
he's the author that speaks about leaky gut... and says along with it there seems to be a little trouble with elimination (recommends enemas or high colonics on a fairly regular basis) and talks about specific spinal misalignments (different ones for psoriasis vs. eczema) and
my dermatologist said to avoid tide.
we use a cortisone creme lotion when we have to (a couple of times a week).
if i can explain to him that i want very much to stop scratching, but need to find a way to do it that i can live with, as he needed to do with his weight, then i believe he will understand.
we have a person come to our home three days a week.
also, we sometimes play a game where i hug him if i'm still itchy after putting lotion on; i hug him as many times as i feel itchy.
my theory about my body is that after 20 years of using topical steroids, and 6 weeks of using oral ones last summer (to combat the flare i caused by quitting the topicals cold turkey), my liver wanted to speak its mind and did so through my skin.
and scratching is a short-term stimulation, not the deeply fulfilling comfort of tenderness, so scratching just leads to more scratching.
her face started clearing for 3 days on her own (no cortisone), yet wasn't sleeping due to "all-over-itchies."
at first we didn't have much ammunition--we just tried to talk them out of prescribing antibiotics--but eventually we started seeing specialists, and got better information...
i've even given her some of the suspect foods (mainly because she begs and screams so i thought i'd try again!).
we get it from our health food store here for about $14 for 4 ounces, which the bottle says is equivalent to 227 500mg softgels of epa (i'm trusting them--haven't done the math).
it seems like the eczema is always worse under my jog bra.
it is a charming book, and you can read it in a couple of hours.

if i will do what i must to my diet, i believe i can rid myself of the problems that i even have now.
she just had chronic breakouts--every single day, worsenig as time went on.
if they are left alone (although they itch horribly) they will fade and disappear within 30 minutes or so.
i was just thinking, you can get ocean salt at the pet shop to make salt water for marine fish tanks.
it's like osteopathy without the force.
so many possible factors: salt water is healing; sun is good too (as in uva treatments); being on vacation usaully means time away from work stress and/or dusty house with pet dander; ocean air is generally pollen free; vacation clothes less irritating than work clothes...
a few unrelated things: there's a web site where you can "search for the pharmaceutical of interest by first character of name", at http://www.rxmed.com/prescribe.html.
i also cook her food from scratch.
but mainly i just wanted to offer some emotional support for what is certainly a difficult situation.
since i started emphasizing the antibacterials, i am less itchy.
it was my husband and i who pursued seeing an allergist and seeing if anything was actually causing it or at least making it worse than it really had to be.
sue - though the viral attack started a month ago, jodi still has a few scattered blister-like rashes broke out on her skin here and there.
it wasn't until i started using zinc oxide ointment, evaporation and zinc pyrithione 2% (skin-cap)
the remedy, the diet, the chiropr., etc.
so, i stopped it, and will do it at just bedtime for a bit longer---just in case it's helping at all.
my fiance does this for me if i can't reach the itchy spot, and i find that putting something on it really does help.
the doctor just wanted to put me on stronger steroids.
but she said she thought that babies confronted with such terrible itchiness needed their parents to step in and stop them--they just weren't strong enough to help themselves.
but just need to get off body odor, they are fine.
i was very self-conscious about it.
then if that doesn't work i will look for the nutregena t. about new clothes.
donna is right; if people have problems with your eczema, let them deal with it.
and he's so sensitive now... just getting excited during play will bring welts out on his face and legs.
it is good to know there are other parents out there that have a hard time getting there little ones attention to stop itching.
i don't know if i will do it because i'm nervous about giving myself injections, but i'll think about it.
the allergist says daniel will most likely outgrow the food allergies all but eggs and peanuts, but by the time he is 4 or 5 will become allergic to airborne allergins.
i had tried chinese herbal treatment on her before when western medicine had failed her but the results had never been so successful.
his face and hands are still red and swollen and he gets blotches on the rest of his body that come and go daily.
now that doesn't work as well, but he's a pretty good talker now, so we have new options.
put him on a four-day rotation diet (only gets a particular food once every four days) from age 14 mos.
i bought a pack of gluten-free bread mix, but the stuff is horrible.
i am greatly impressed with your efforts, especially what you call "training" and "counseling".
i took her to our family doctor who diagnosed her with eczema and told us to apply lubriderm lotion and benedryl for the itchiness.
i want to share with you information regarding a new moisturizing lotion i have been using.
even knowing what i know now, though, i might not have done it, then--breastfeeding was terribly painful for me, i was really ready to quit...
after i steamed the veggie, i cut the stem in 3-4 inches a piece and give them to the girls as finger food.
they predict it based on family histories of allergies.
but since that time i have had no hay fever or significant allergies, and i used to have pills and steroid inhaler-the works.
;-) i've noticed that when i'm clothes shopping or fabric shopping, my hands frequently start acting up (getting hot & itchy; patches of e. start to redden).
in their opinion, kids retain these symptoms for their whole lives because doctors don't change anything that causes the problems--they just deal with the manifestations--quiet the skin with steroids, open the bronchial tubes with inhalants, etc.
i have renewed energy, do not scratch at night and am not experiencing any itching that i cannot easily resist.
the health food store i go to sells it for $4.19.
i sometimes wonder if i had had a flare up when i was pregnant with jodi, she would not have had her e. date: 21 feb 1997 11:45:22 from: tina subject: itchy heads and new clothes thanks to all who wrote about kid's scalps.
but if she's really itchy the antihistimine doesn't do a thing--she'll still wake up all night.
i am miserable in my own skin with it head to toe.
i guess it's a good thing he was used to having a bottle.
also, i just figured out that i'm allergic to polypropylene glycol which is in the majority of medications my doctor prescribed to me for all these years.
i've been asked all of my life about mine, and it hurts sometimes (because it is so embarassing), but i've learned to deal with it (as you obviously have).
but no problems so far (she had several ear infections until she was two but now can blow her nose and has never has another).
date: 12 feb 1997 13:25:43 from: gayle subject: egyptian cotton sheets egyptian cotton refers to the fiber it is made from.
since then all of my eczema has been burning (it feels better today though).
it does directly affect the baby.
i know that backrubs help daniel, too.
the killer is that these things are available for sale widely and that you can't check people haven't got the other drugs it interacts with.
date: 5 feb 1997 15:36:55 from: rita subject: child eczema i'm glad to report that my expedition helped my jodi a whole lot.
i have my fingers crossed, fully expecting this beast to rear its head again, but at least i have hope now.
let's get organized, lets spend this week listing foods that work.
the first 2 weeks her skin weeped so much i was really worried.
i have noticed that since i have quit taking the nature's biotics caplet, my eczema has gotten worse, so i know that that one is helpful.
i was also advised not to breast feed my baby for a week to see if breast milk was the culprit.
i figured that those will be pictures we will look at for the rest of our lives so i wanted to look normal.
she's been going to a hom eopath for 5 months.
her diagnosis is toxins in the blood.
triludan fyi, i read in the paper that the fda has announced its intent to ban terfenadine, which is the active ingredient of triludan (anti-histamine).
gagging i am not sure where that theory comes from but my gag reflex is so strong i cannot even hold a pen in my mouth without gagging!
i don't know he could tell it's leaky gut or not without specimens.
the more you care about it, the more others will care about it.
he then tested positive to potatoes and soy, but his last test came up negative.
i also know we could have it alot worse, disease and health wise...
so we began a game where we would (both) scratch our legs for a second, then throw our hands in the air and yell "stop!"
the blood test in my opinion means nothing, even my gi never performed these tests on mac.
when you get overwhelmed, post another message like you did, that's what we're here for.
i would put money on a bet that in the next twenty years, they will find that antibiotics and steroids contribute to the progression from eczema to athsma...
jodi was born a full term baby at 8 lbs 2oz.
i'm back to eczema on my legs only.
i've also felt painfully self-conscious in the bridal salons i've been in, worried that the sales assistant was looking at the spots on my arms.
cetaphil/sun we have already stopped using the cetaphil.
i used to think her problem is leaky gut but am not so sure anymore.
when that didn't help much i took her to a derm.
i also keep my heat turned down in the house to the point that others complain, but heat and sweat drive me batty.
the force of the scratching seems to be the only thing that equals the force of the frustration.
sometimes when he is scratching alot i lay him across my lap and rub his back and down his legs.
you can just toss it out or compost it when your done.

they say it can aid in weight loss, anti-aging process and a lot of other things.
my herbalist pals tell me milk thistle supports and repairs the liver.
i am researching the possibility of asbestos being the problem at the house i live in now.
i don't know why but with all the vitamins/antihistamines that i take, i'm glad that i don't gag.
simply because, from my experience, only light cleansing is more irritative than none whatsoever.
i am going to try head and shoulders first, since there is some of that in my bathroom already.
i also remember my mum using olive oil on my scalp eczema when i was younger.
something in neosporin can cause allergic reactions.
new research has shown it's not as safe as was previously thought.
truth be known i would rather it is the itch, my son is now at the point he can say "i itch" i like having the communication even if it is 2:00 a.m.
then, i was taking cyclosporine for a year and wasn't itchy.
in the past she recommended euphrasia when my eyes kept watering for no apparent reason, and that worked really well.
please note, that the vitamin regimen i listed above needs to have vitamin c added to it.
i then had to go have it removed which was real pleasant.
homeopathic routes can just take an awfully long time sometimes, especially for a baby who can't speak for itself.
pure aloe vera with the vegelatum ointment is working well on her legs.
(her face still looked real good at this point so he wasn't just reading her.)
in my history i have successfully treated eczema and my repetitive stress injury with one remedy, rhus tox.
date: 18 feb 1997 17:32:03 from: unknown subject: a newcomer my daughter is also allergic to tomatoes she reacts with redness, itching and hives around her mouth.
after investing a million dollars and hours in vitamins, blood tests and every other possible natural cure, i think they are it.

sweat purges infections i too notice great results when i'm in the sun (esp.
if you don't already have a liquid form of colloidal trace minerals the one i get is by "innovative natural products", brown bottle, 1 oz., 4 oz., and something like 7 oz., called colloidal multiple minerals.
the one thing that we think really worked was the evening primrose oil.
i have been tested my times, the most thorough being a blood test.
even when i am constipated my eczema can flare (probably because the toxins are held in the body for too long (also related to leaky gut, i think).
feeding your baby even if your dr asked you to stop for a while.
but occasionally i've had throat swelling and have needed medical help.
they seem to make no real difference in the sense that if she's itchy she still wakes up to scratch regardless of being drugged around the clock (which i did for a week).
i now double rinse clothing that touches the affected areas and omit fabric softener on them.
i am throwing it out as i have not seen seafood being mentioned here.
i have never seen another child's skin that looks like daniel's---we are always asked questions about his face in public.
the aveeno oatmeal bath caused full body contact dermatitis.
it would almost appear to me that i mark significant improvements on a weekly basis... especially this last 3 weeks.
one of my sisters still had braces on her teeth when she got married, and i remember how upset she was, moaning about how the photos were going to be terrible, practicing smiling without showing her teeth, etc.
i personally suffered very much with my skin problems as a child (my brother had it too but not as bad).
i use to work in retail and would stock shelves and just the chemicals from the cardboard would make me red and itchy---i don't have e. sue, thanks for the imput on e, allergies and asthma.
could you tell me how they do the allergy testing on a baby -- just curious in case we need to do this.
for example, tomatoes make his face red and itchy while he eats them, but don't seem to have a secondary reaction through his skin (ie, his eczema doesn't get worse after having eaten them).
although both my midwives and her pediatrician assured me that she just had "heat rash", i knew she was displaying eczema and allergic reactions.
just do the best you can do and keep talking about your fears with your loved ones.
they are amazed at what he looks like now--no extra eyelid folds, no ear cracks, a clear face, etc.
i would add my "2 cents" that maybe it is time to try something else... the first perhaps being taking nothing for a while, then if that doesn't get you somewhere, try the immuran.
my chemistry isn't great, but if glycerin is one of those substances that draws water to itself (hydrophilic?) from the air, then it must also drag water out of any other surface it's in contact with, in this case the skin.
no cats here, however the dr. did indicated that kids don't always show correct test till they are about 5, i wish it would have worked.

of course i also had my share of goodies -- chocolate.
i know that they love me and want to see me well, but i don't want them to bring it up.
i am not sure that will show up on the test.
telling me to stop scratching doesn't really help me at all!
the list of pollens, molds, foods, danders, etc. to which she has tested as severely allergic is mind-bending.
in fact i have not had any e. since, anywhere, except a small 1-inch patch of dry skin on my upper arm that does not grow or itch!
since you were interested in the "good" foods i figured the "bad" ones might be of interest too: i believe that the overuse of cortisone creams all my life has caused some problems.
the great news was that he weighed 20 lbs, 15 oz--a gain of a whole pound.
note that seldane is an antihistamine that is not supposed to make you sleepy, and the ketoconazole, i assume, is an antibiotic (because the warning mentions that it is used to treat skin infections).

he thought that it was unlikely that the steroids would *cause* the keratoconus, but that it might aggravate it, simply because steroids thin the skin etc.
i went right back to nursing jodi when the expedition made no difference to her
i'd thought that interrupting him would just make him more frustrated, or angry (he sure reacted that way!).
shaklee basic-h is pretty neat on bad stains and it is non-toxic.
sometimes stray cats live in basements of buildings and their dander gets into the heating system and bothers cat-allergic tenants who think that they don't live with cats!
as this is not for life, just for a month, i expect to be able to keep it up; the only real problem i have is in finding something to eat for breakfast/lunch.
i was able to get a beautiful one year old portrait for her birthday!
i dumped a friend largely because she was so goopy feel-sorry-for-me it made me sick.
the only thing that i've known to give me equal satisfaction is when i can ask a friend to gently rub my back, and of course this has to be a very close friend, and i have to be willing to let myself sink into the feeling in my body at the time.
they supply the soap dispensers at the hospital with hibiclens and it is murder on my eczema
the enclosure says it's a steroid - my dr said i would like it, that it was stronger than the beta-val i was using.
eczema is no fun, but otherwise our son is a beautiful, healthy little boy and so full of joy.

[ann, i can now empathize with your full body herpes infection.
i will be looking out for any messages you may send on your progress.

my son reacts strongly to smoke filled rooms and antique stores, this is in addition to his food intollerances.
she just had chronic breakouts--every single day, worsenig as time went on.
also, i just figured out that i'm allergic to polypropylene glycol which is in the majority of medications my doctor prescribed to me for all these years.
i've been avoiding visiting anyone with a dog for 3 weeks now and these are the 3 weeks she's been clear.
now my sweat makes me itch and burn, but probably only because my skin is broken.
almost all drugs have side effects of dermatitis (eczema), psoriasis, pruritis (itching), pityriasis, etc.
i don't think my "drugs for every occasion" book exactly says terfenadine is safe.

i use to work in retail and would stock shelves and just the chemicals from the cardboard would make me red and itchy---i don't have e. sue, thanks for the imput on e, allergies and asthma.
those scaley red itchy areas are a bit of a giveaway that i have it, without any gag test!
maybe my skin's not so hyper dry and weak after all -- maybe if i just swab the deck more often, i'd be okay without all the gloves and vaseline routines.
i have only been on this list for a couple of weeks and it makes me feel like i am not alone with such a challenging problem.
from: debi subject: to: e baby moms i feel overwhelmed, there are quite a few of us who have babies with severe e. debbie, rita, jolie, karen and more.

i personally suffered very much with my skin problems as a child (my brother had it too but not as bad).

earlier in the day yesterday, she saw the chiropractor.
i have signed jodi up for the clinical study as she'll be a year old in 2 weeks.

we don't eat any corn, i make our bread and we eat almost no premade food.
as long as i don't rub too long or hard & irritate my skin it can actually make it feel soft (even normal sometimes).date: 27 feb 1997 11:19:25 from: alvaro subject:

good luck with your wedding plans and remember that there is at least one other person out there who can totally empathize.

since she was no where near raw/bleeding/oozing this time she's practically clear after only 2 days of no real itching.
i wonder though, if we are not perpetuating the problem, by taking these legal drugs so often.
interestingly it's not the caffeine that nullifies the remedy, it's coffee.
my experience has been that anything "strong" was too strong.
i really want to avoid messing up her immune system even more and possibly contracting other auto-immune diseases.

besides my husbands e and allegies, we have a nephew with bad asthma, and my husband's great grandfather had asthma also.
i am researching the possibility of asbestos being the problem at the house i live in now.
as for interactions with other drugs, antifungal drugs (including ketoconazole and itraconazole) and the antibiotic erthromycin increase terfenadine levels and may affect the heart.

since she was no where near raw/bleeding/oozing this time she's practically clear after only 2 days of no real itching.

once spring has sprung, i'm sure the public will have questions and comments.
i don't know what condition my eczema will be in on the day of the wedding, so that has limited my choices of dress styles (i don't trust my back/arm eczema enough to wear a sleeveless dress with a low back, but then co-workers ask my why i would want to wear a dress with short sleeves in hot weather, etc.).
the anticholinergic effects of terfandine may be increased by drgus which have anticholinergic effects.

it is just as soothing as aveeno and a lot less expensive.
at first we gave him only about a teaspoon a day, and it had no effect.
he will get better on his own.
also, i can't believe a dr. would actually joke about eczema.
she seemed to undergo a transformation... clear, beautiful skin, and she became a truly joyful child.
anyway, this weekend she was completely clear for the first time ever!!!!!

real meals are not much of a problem, as i'm a decent cook and work from scratch anyhow (very little ready-made stuff in my food ever); so i just choose things without cheese, cream and eggs.
my eczema was most active on my hands, and feet, though at times it attacked my ears badly.
this took a couple of months of use to clear up, but i haven't had any of the eczema return and it is the middle of winter around here and the rest of my skin is flaring up from the dry, cold air.
i was born with eczema, came home from the hospital with it.
i've been sleeping with a soft, white cotton tee-shirt over my pillow case because it's the only thing that doesn't make me itch!
he just gave me an example of a somewhat infamous movie actress that was able to perform her role on the big screen because she had eczema.
she has had so many injections of cortisteroids that drs now tell her she has probably done considerable damage to some vital systems.
then get yourself something slinky to wear at before or after wedding activities, so you can pick when you think your skin is at its best.
i used to use a hydrocorozone cream that was in a cold cream type base.
that's one reason we have this list -- so we can vent our feelings without offending professionals on whom we must rely.
i'm all for the specific tests he's running... and i didn't expect much more since we already got julia under control once ourselves.

it is just as soothing as aveeno and a lot less expensive.
anyhow, the infant herpes infection did not leave any major scars on me.
i think it was linda who talked about the guilt feelings of passing her eczema on to her kid.
this makes them look pretty raw and swollen on top of the normal dry and cracking.
jojoba oil is very expensive, but some health food places sell it in bulk, and you don't need very much.
fever up to 104 about every two weeks for three months, they i didn't sleep because of worry now i don't sleep because of the itch factor.
right now i am pretty good but a couple of months ago i was covered head to toe and could barely sleep, work or do anything.
you are fortunate in having a loved one who is there for support.
i brushed my hand on the sheets in a department store and couldn't believe the silky smooth feel.
if my mother had had the intelligence to handle the emotional aspects i think i would have made major improvement.
those of us who've had eczema all our lives remember the hope that we would grow out of it, and i hate to be a spoil sport and say "don't get your hopes too high" because i remember how that hope kept me alive for 14 years.
i would not be at all surprised if either substance provoked strong allergic reactions too.
the only thing jodi has benefited from is chinese herbal treatment.
i've tried pounding pillows, but that doesn't match the refined motor skill sensation of fingers scratching.
wow i feel like i could write a book about everything i experimented with to help my e. unfortunately, i don't know that it would necessarily help anyone.
it upsets me to think that by nursing, i was causing his eczema, but it's probably true.
i feel hesitant to give my baby steroids (although they have made a significant improvement in her skin).

i know women who, for religious regions, never wear sleeveless garments.
if my mother had had the intelligence to handle the emotional aspects i think i would have made major improvement.
the picture of jodi on the floor, scratching rather than yelling for help, is a replica of what isaac used to do.
