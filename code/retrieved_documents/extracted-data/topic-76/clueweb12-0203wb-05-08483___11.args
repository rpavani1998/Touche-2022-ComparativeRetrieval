by trusting one person, or multiple people that said sad food was ok.
the natural enzymes are removed to prevent agave syrup from fermenting and turning into tequila in your food pantry or cabi­net.
i just wanted to point out that honey isn't vegan.
because insulin and leptin act as key signals in regulating how much food you eat, as well as your body weight, dietary fructose can also contribute to increased food intake and weight gain.
i devoted 3 days to her and loved her.
the honey would be left sitting in hives when it could be put to good use by people.
road kill doesn't make me drool and most people are disgusted at the site of blood and guts.
but that's what you find in natural fruits like apples, etc.
i find the best solution to this problem is to train yourself to like foods even when they aren't sweet, even when you are used to them being sweet.
not processed "foods" or extracts.
the harvested pina looks like a large pineapple and can weigh anywhere from 50 to 150 pounds.
i started putting less on my breakfast cereals and go for raw honey more often now too.
this can lead to a wide range of health problems, including weight gain, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, premature aging, and heart dis­ease.
i've noticed that this really starting enhancing your flavor receptors for other hidden wonderful flavors that you have been missing out out.
last time i checked , the meat is usually killed in order to eat it.
if i knew someone who had a few pet cows and chickens and took some eggs and milk once in awhile i wouldn't judge them harshly.
i personally don't really like stevia, i will use agave or honey over that any day.
show some respect as i will live my life the way feels right to me.
in addition, the fda has refused shipments of agave syrup due to excessive pesticide residues.
amber (similar in color and flavor to raw) many varieties of agave nectar are processed at relatively low temperatures (below 118°f) and are marketed as a “raw” food.
if you’ve tried stevia and were bothered by an aftertaste, it could be the way the plant was processed.
i only go through a jar a year.
i'm intolerant to milk and eggs myself so wouldn't partake.
it’s also important to understand that whereas the glucose in other sugars are converted to blood glucose, fructose is a relatively unregulated source of fuel that your liver converts to fat and cholesterol.
it is much sweeter than sugar, but has no calories.
people will eat people to survive as well.
in case you doubt the influence of marketing in setting trends and consumer buying habits, look at these statistics.
the sap is separated from the plant and treated with heat, similar to how maple sap is made into maple syrup.
additionally, fructose consumption has been shown to significantly increase uric acid.
her tibetan mother in law would only eat meat when an animal was found dead.
if this was a vegetarian site, than fine, but to make vegetarian recommendations on a vegan forum is hypercritical also please don't tell me what to do.
and i am really saddened that honey is taken from bees so humans have the pleasure of eating/tasting/using it.
fructose may also interfere with your body’s ability to metabolize copper.
this can result in depletion of collagen and elastin, which are vital connective tissues.
it can even bring on depression.
i already told you how i cared for a dying bee and that i know they have intelligence.
- agave syrup may not have a low glycemic index.
i believe agave is still a great sweetener and will always be good in the right moderation.
top even if, theoretically, obtaining honey from some people/beekeepers didn't entail harm to the bee, it's still an animal product and exploiting the bees/taking from them/their children - you also can't state how much the bees would need or want and that you're taking "jsut the right amount."
fully chemically processed sap from the agave plant is known as hydrolyzed high fructose inulin syrup.
vegans don't exploit animals on purpose.
did you not see that i posted that the tibetan lady only ate animals that had died of natural causes not killed for their meat?
i know a local bee keeper and bees continually make honey- they only eat a very small amount of it- they make far more then they would actually eat.
since most agave syrup has such a high percentage of fructose, your blood sugar will likely spike just as it would if you were consuming regular sugar or hfcs, and you would also run the risk of raising your triglyceride levels.
in the end, my conclusion is to be careful when taking in new information.
the fructose thing i am still not sure about, but it's definitely not as bad for you as hfcs.
because insulin and leptin act as key signals in regulating how much food you eat, as well as your body weight, dietary fructose can also contribute to increased food intake and weight gain.
i actually looked into it enough to know that there are some agave nectar out there that are truly raw.
i found this article to be very interesting, it talkes about how agave cannot be considered raw, and the not so natural process that goes through.
agave syrup is about 16 calories per teaspoon, the same as table sugar.
i don't agree with big scale exploitation of them and using chemicals in their hives etc but the bee keeper i know locally uses homeopathy for the bees if they are not well, loves them and cares for them.
ummmm..... honey is not vegan.
animals that are carnivores eat other animals in nature, this is natural.
top whereas agave may not be raw, it is still much healthier than most sweeteners.
highly effective agave product marketing campaigns have persuaded consumers the sweetener is a healthy alternative to sugar.
i understand that honey is made in what could be called "animal cruelty", but with the current threat of bees disappearring due to human existence, isn't it our responsibilty to maintain the bee population?
industry insiders are concerned agave distributors are using lesser, even toxic, agave plants due to a shortage of blue agave.
honey is a really great sweetener, but unfortunately it doesn't work for everything, and agave, although not as great as everyone hoped it was going to be, is still better than any mainstream processed sugars.
i will certainly keep investigating and reading to inform myself (although the decision in my case has already been made), and good luck with your own research.
it is ok to believe that, but then you are rating the intelligence of a species and saying that if they are not as intellgent then it is ok.
top pinapple is always a great true natural choice for a sweet tooth.
stealing is a human word- squirrels have been known to "steal" or take peoples' sandwiches- going in windows and helping themselves.
top greenwood, the person that wrote that website even admits that they are biased.
he said his piece; you said yours......and you're asking questions to continue the conversation in a way that makes greenwood put on the defensive.
but again, it's someone's choice to eat honey; they don't need to defend their choice, but the discussions here are supposed to be vegan.
this is because the blue agave has a high carbohydrate content, which results in a high concentration of fructose in the final product.
therefore, if you need to lose weight, fructose is one type of sugar you’ll definitely want to avoid, no matter what the source is.
sap is removed from the pina, filtered, and heated to break down the carbohydrates into sugars.
highly effective agave product marketing campaigns have per­suaded consumers the sweetener is a healthy alternative to sugar.
fructose is absorbed into the body slower than sucrose(therefore the much lower glycemic index)...
a copper deficiency can also result in anemia, fragile bones, defects in your arteries, infertility, high cholesterol and heart disease, and uncontrolled blood sugar levels.
the writer, dr. mercola is far from being a vegan, but he is all for clean, organic and raw food, and also for local food production/consumption: http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/07/02/ag...
bees will carry on making and making honey they will never eat-they cannot stop themselves even when they have more than enough.
factory farming is cruel and inhumane.
sugar and sweeteners wreak havoc on your health and are highly addictive.
as far as i know this is a raw vegan site, and raw vegans don't eat honey, because honey is not vegan.
this is how we all got into trouble in the first place.
all it makes me want to do is read more about agave, and maybe find a source that does do it the right way, etc... i feel better than when i'm consuming regular sugar, so that's something for me.
they are, without question, far more damaging to your health than regular sugar.
last time i checked , the meat is usually killed in order to eat it."
i think it is better to use manuka honey.
i don't like meat at all but respect what this woman did.
ick!top i think the info about the sugar interesting- sugar was one of the foods i tested intolerant to and it says it can suppress the immune system and bring on allergies.
bees looked after by small keepers here in britain or wild forest bees are not exploited like the huge us bee places in the usa.
agave syrup can be up to three times as sweet as table sugar, so it takes less to sweeten a food or beverage.
it is the same as eating a cow or chicken, because we are animals and they are animals.
the sap is sepa­rated from the plant and treated with heat, similar to how maple sap is made into maple syrup.
agave syrup is not a live food.
agave products more than tripled in number between 2003 and 2007.
as for stevia, again, i prefer the whole (green!) herb, powdered.
certainly you can tolerate small amounts if you are healthy and the majority of your diet is healthy, but let’s face it the average american is consuming over 150 pounds a year of sugar or nearly half a pound a day.
- agave syrup is not low calorie.
therefore, if you need to lose weight, fructose is one type of sugar you’ll definitely want to avoid, no matter what the source is.
i don't find it necessary to eat sweet tasting foods, as they are not good me (or anyone too much)
harvesting the sap when an agave plant is about seven to 10 years old, the leaves are removed to expose the core, or pina, of the plant.
agave syrup is not a whole food -- it is fractionated and processed.
it doesn't make your body crash out and strip it of nutirents like other processed sweeteners.
agave products more than tripled in number between 2003 and 2007.
i think that it would be great to see what others find.
edible parts of the agave are the flowers, leaves, stalks and the sap.
i have noticed a rash of these anti-agave articles and what i have to say is this... it may not be "the best thing in the world" but thats okay because as a healthy person we know that we shouldn't eat a lot of concentrated sugars.
" i'm not telling you what to do, asking for you to respect other peoples' choices and yes even if that means they eat meat- coming all critical will not win fans to your causes.
i hardly use sweeteners now, and when i do it is organic, fair trade wild forest honey.
the same agave plant produces all three varieties of commercially sold syrup, depending on the amount of heat used in processing.
i'm a druid and bee is one of my totems, my consience is clear having a tiny bit of ethically sources honey.
according to dr. ingrid kohlstadt, a fellow of the american college of nutrition and an associate faculty member at johns hopkins school of public health: “[agave is] almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing.”
this can result in depletion of collagen and elastin, which are vital connective tissues.
just because it's on a "raw food forum" does not make it instantaneous truth.
the bees make more then enough to last themselves the winter and my local beekepers maintain cruelty-free practices.
it’s also important to understand that whereas the glucose in other sugars are converted to blood glucose, fructose is a relatively unregulated source of fuel that your liver converts to fat and cholesterol.
top i am with you rawlizard, i prefer whole foods.
the bees have plenty of honey for themselves.
in the u.s., you’ll find stevia not in the sweetener aisle of your local grocery, but in the supplement section.
this range of fructose content hardly makes agave syrup a logical choice if you’re hoping to avoid the high levels of fructose in hfcs (high fructose corn syrup).
i'm a vegan, so i don't eat honey, of course.
i know of other vegans who choose to have a little ethically sound honey in their diets.
agaves are not cacti, but are actually related to the lily and amaryllis families of plants.
this is because the blue agave has a high carbohydrate content, which results in a high concentration of fructose in the final prod­uct.
moderation in this case is five pounds or less per year, which is a far cry from the 150 pounds per year consumed by the majority of americans.
agave is also heavily promoted as a low glycemic food, enticing diabetics.
i'm not sure why people disrespect that especially more so with regard to honey; i've never seen someone post that instead of eggplant, they will choose to eat deer.
caging up animals against their will is exploiting them.
elevated levels of uric acid are markers for heart disease.
basically , you are saying that because bees arent as intelligent as cows, that it is ok to take the honey.
bees work for themselves and the planet- their pollinating, medicinal honey, propolis etc.
sugar increases your insulin and leptin levels and decreases receptor sensitivity of both these hormones.
harvesting the sap when an agave plant is about seven to 10 years old, the leaves are removed to expose the core, or pina, of the plant.
we all know that there is a processing involved when agave does not go bad for weeks and weeks in our pantry.
according to dr. ingrid kohlstadt, a fellow of the american college of nutrition and an associate faculty member at johns hopkins school of public health: “[agave is] almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing.”
sugar is just never going to be good for you in large doses.
that said, if greenwood made a thread actually asking what people thought about it, that would be one thing.
i buy my honey from local beekeepers, its raw, they don't use chemicals, they don't feed the bees sugar, and they don't kill off the queen at the end of the season.
a copper deficiency can also result in anemia, fragile bones, defects in your arteries, infertility, high choles­terol and heart disease, and uncontrolled blood sugar levels.
i think, actually i feel, that bees are in fact quite intelligent for insects.
tastes much better than the *white* powdered processed *extract* (or clear liquid, depending on what type of processing.)
just wanted to get the facts straight for the bees.
while i don’t recommend it, consuming sugar in moderation isn’t likely to cause serious health problems.
it's no jump to say that it's all in someone's head/made up that somehow insects are less important/more "gently" exploited than, say, a cow or a larger animal.
i'm 42 and live a spiritual life, your judgement of me is rude..
i once read a biography about a girl who married a tibetan man and she went to stay in tibet with his buddhist family for 6 months.
nobody is saying bee keepers are bad people.
but an interesting point is that the bees are robbing the plants of the pollen they worked so hard to produce and need to create baby plants.
the stuff i use, which i'm sure lots of people do is madhava organic agave nectar.
i have seen posts from others here who eat honey but it is only me you choose to lambast.
i'm still confused, because agave has a low gl.
i have rescued an injured bumblebee and taken care of her til she died.
in addition, consuming high amounts of concentrated fructose may cause health problems ranging from mineral depletion, to insulin resistance, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and even miscarriage in pregnant women.
sugar suppresses your immune system, causing problems with allergies and digestive disorders.
it is the sap of the plant that is used to make agave syrup.
depending upon where the agave comes from and the amount of heat used to process it, your agave syrup can be anywhere from 55 percent to 90 percent fructose!
i took her home and cared for her for 3 days- made her a shelter in a box with leaves to sit on and gave her honey and water.
but she wouldn't have an animal killed for her.
no matter your nutritional type, sugar is not good for you.
if you’re interested in kicking your sugar addiction, i highly recommend trying a meridian tapping technique called turbo tapping, which has helped thousands of people kick their sugar and soda habits.
that is true, one article does not provide all the evidence.
they evolved as a crucial part of the ecosystem.
top less of the lecture please- some of the vegan info is biased and exggarated.
honey has health benefits other sweeteners don't- especially manuka.
as a person with kidney problems and hypo-glycemia who really has to watch my sugar intake or i feel it deeply, i can tell you that agave doesn't effect me negatively unless i use a huge amount of it.
with agave i use way less to achieve the same sweetness.
you would think they would have the good stuff.
while i don’t recommend it, consuming sugar in moderation isn’t likely to cause serious health problems.
in addition, consuming high amounts of concentrated fructose may cause health problems ranging from mineral depletion, to insulin resistance, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and even miscarriage in pregnant women.
3- sugar is processed using animal products such as bone charcoal!
i love them and as i posted before i rescued one when i found her lying weak and dying on a pavement.
but don't confuse people by saying it is ok to steal honey from bees, because vegans don't do that.
fructose may also interfere with your body’s ability to metabolize copper.
if you’ve tried stevia and were bothered by an aftertaste, it could be the way the plant was processed.
they lived on land where much didn't grow and she was forced to eat meat for survival sometimes
they die of hunger, illness and old age.
antibiotics are made by compnaies which do horrific animal testing and are getting resistant to bacteria strains.
thanks in large part to clever marketing which positions the product as a healthy alternative to sugar and artificial sweeteners.
agave nectar is devoid of many of the nutrients contained in the original, whole plant.
and remember agave is vegan, some of the other choices are not (like honey).top btw vegans that eat honey are called vegetarians, not vegans.
i am questioning how honey is showing up on a vegan forum.
so right there, he was saying they aren't organic, but mine is.
it even explains bee keeping.
;-) just because it can be done, doesn't make it right.
honey is food for baby bees just like milk is food for baby cows.
bees get injured by the bee keepers.
http://alteredplates.blogspot.com/2008/12/madhavas-craig-gerbore... i, for one, continue to view it as a healthy sweetener...in moderation.
i suppose you are very young and ideal and think everyone in the world has the opportunity to be vegan- they sadly don't.
stick with the agave if your vegan.
when she passed i made her a little coffin out of a matchbox and buried her.
if i ingest cane sugar, beet sugar, or high fructose corn syrup, i am feeling horrible within minutes.

i never bought it but sadly it is added to nearly all processed foods- even organic sauces and baked beans.
agave nectar is devoid of many of the nutrients contained in the original, whole plant.
no idea why you think taking something that doesn't belong to you as being all right as long as you leave a little for the animal you are stealing from.
i will reiterate that bees make far more honey than they will ever eat and honey has health benefits- manuka can be used instead of antibiotics on wounds.
i am also concerned about the high fructose content, and the health effects associated to it.
some beekeepers are better than others,, just like some factory farms are better than others.
some even kill other animals for food.
believe whatever you want, to eat honey or not eat honey, my point is just that it is vegan.
so if you are vegan than leave the bees alone, or call yourself a honey-tarian or someting.
they are, without question, far more damaging to your health than regular sugar.
there are definitely nonvegans on this board, and that is fine - they are allowed to be here and are welcome by me.

some people eat animals they find dead already.
please read this: http://www.vegetus.org/honey/honey.htm bees are animals.
a significant danger here is that fructose does not stimulate your insulin secretion, nor enhance leptin production, which is thought to be involved in appetite regulation.
just remember, a lot of mainstream health practitioners still believe that us raw fooders are nuts and will eventually became malnourished emaciated messed up individuals.
whenever i read articles on dr. mercola's website i always read the reviews/responses of the members of his site.

i think personally, that in the world today where both ordinary people and experts and scientists seem to be telling us what is and isn't health, with a lot of them giving good reasons, the only thing that we can do as consumers is do as much research as possible on the food and products we consume.
however, if you have insulin issues, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or if you’re overweight, i suggest you avoid all sweeteners, including stevia, since any sweetener can decrease your insulin sensitivity.
however, my personal problem with agave is not whether is raw, or organic, but is the fact that has been processed.
ethical bee keeping is the way to go.
give it some time and they will start finding problems with stevia too.
