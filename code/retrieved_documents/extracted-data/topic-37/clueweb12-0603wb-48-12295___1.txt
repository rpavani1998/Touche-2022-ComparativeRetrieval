"user friendly" is probably one of the most meaningless terms ever created to discuss a user interface design.
it's counter-intuitive to code, performs worse and lacks features than d3d. major developers (id etc) are using d3d even though they don't like being locked to windows, simply because it is far superior to opengl.

yes, it is running native.
10:27 pm show - -15 + ok, but who need diretctx ?
the console manufacturers can't pick anything other than gl or d3d.
what we need is more competition, a newcomer 3d api (or many of them), designed from scratch.
that's why wine developers have steered clear of re-implementing the same api features and why it's difficult to get many games working through wine.
so, no, it's not linux native.
it's really a great os, and given the chance, i'm sure it'll run the same apps that windows runs even better.

obviously you are pleased with what you have.
it's microsoft's api!
the only reason im still on windows is on my netbook for blackberry manager (for tethering) and main desktop for gaming.
so we'll have windows games running on a ps3 with the kinect device.
, the battle continues...
this is probably the most ignorant statement in your entire post and shows your complete and utter lack of understanding.
while it's better than just having 1, a duopoly is still not very competitive.
people will not just up and leave windows.

in case you missed the link i posted earlier, i'll provide it again: http://linux.oneandoneis2.org/lnw.htm that article is 5-6 years old, and yet amazingly the dead horse still gets beaten to a pulp with the same old arguments from the same people who have no idea about anything outside of their zone of familiarity.
manufacturers have to provide drivers for their hw to be "supported".
and opengl and directx are really close, from feature and performance point of view.
and we're still a few months away before we can see wine trying it out in an alpha/beta state.

opengl has had slack periods recently (eg the 3.0 debacle where they dragged on forever then deleted most of the improvements developers were waiting on).

microsoft works hard with the gaming industry and the vendors, the competition come from the consoles.

mlopinto2k1 09/26/2010 10:47 pm
anyway, it's not mature at all
but this might all be moot sometime soon.
gamers on linux are used to there being a limited choice of 3d apis.
see now this is a very common statement by somebody who doesn't understand the concept of libre software.
the cost associated to develop on a different api is too high.

there are alot of arrogant windows fanboys who, firstly, don't have much of an understanding about theirown operating system, and secondly don't have a clue about linux either, but pretend that they do.
you can't create a new 3d api at present unless you implement a translation layer to either gl or d3d. it'd be like trying to write a new language or even a new compiler if the x86 spec was secret.
