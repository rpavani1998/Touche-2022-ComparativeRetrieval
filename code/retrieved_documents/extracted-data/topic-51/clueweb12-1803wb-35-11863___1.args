patients with malnutrition, aids, chronic ethanol abuse, or anorexia nervosa may be at increased risk for morbidity because of deficient glutathione stores and inadequate detoxification of napqi.
drug category: gi decontaminants -- emergency treatment in poisoning caused by drugs and chemicals.
frequency: in the us: acetaminophen is one of the most common agents in overdose reported to the american association of poison control centers.
nac also functions as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant and has positive inotropic and vasodilating effects, which improve microcirculatory blood flow and oxygen delivery to tissues.
because antidotal therapy is most efficacious when initiated within 8 hours postingestion, the clinician must attempt to obtain an accurate history of the time(s) of ingestion, the quantity and formulation of acetaminophen ingested, and any co-ingestants (eg, diphenhydramine, other anticholinergic drugs, opioids), which may delay absorption.
both ibuprofen and aspirin cause gastrointestinal bleeding because they are chemical that are irritating and the dosages is high (325 mg or more for aspirin, 400 & 800 mg for ibuprofen).
2) it costs a fraction of ibuprofen. 3)  those women taking aspirin regularly while pregnant have under one-forth the incident of caesarean section (5.6% versus 23.9% in a meta-study).
evidence of end-organ (hepatic, renal) toxicity often is delayed 24-48 hours postingestion.
considered potentially more effective than metoclopramide; in addition, adverse effects are less common.
drug name metoclopramide (reglan) -- functions as antiemetic by blocking dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of cns.
the toxic dose of apap after a single acute ingestion is 150 mg/kg or approximately 7 g in adults, although the at-risk dose may be lower in persons with alcoholism and other susceptible individuals.
the antidote for apap poisoning is n-acetylcysteine (nac).
second, they both cause stomach bleeding.
nac also functions as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant and has positive inotropic and vasodilating effects, which improve microcirculatory blood flow and oxygen delivery to tissues.
for these reasons, antiemetic therapy often is necessary to allow successful administration of nac.
nac increases glutathione stores, combines directly with napqi as a glutathione substitute, and enhances sulfate conjugation.
however, ibuprofen is coated, and the comparison is to uncoated aspirin.

when administered iv, infuse over 1 h through a 0.2 micron millipore pyrogen filter.
however, ibuprofen is coated, and the comparison is to uncoated aspirin.
excess apap is then metabolized in the liver via the mixed function oxidase p450 system to a toxic metabolite,n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone-imine (napqi).
emergency department care: consultations: agents used in the treatment of acetaminophen poisoning include activated charcoal,n-acetylcysteine, and antiemetics.
vasodilating effects decrease morbidity and mortality once hepatotoxicity is well established.
patients with enhanced ability to make napqi because of induction of the p450 system, specifically cyp2e1, may be at increased risk of morbidity; these patients include those taking agents known to induce this enzyme activity, such as rifampin, phenobarbital, isoniazid, phenytoin, carbamazepine, or patients with chronic ethanol abuse.
in acute overdose or when maximum daily dose is exceeded over a prolonged period, the normal pathways of metabolism become saturated.
adult dose 10-20 mg iv, not to exceed 1 mg/kg; not to exceed 3 mg/kg/d divided prn pediatric dose 1-2 mg/kg total dose contraindications documented hypersensitivity interactions may antagonize effects of metoclopramide; opiate analgesics may increase metoclopramide toxicity in cns pregnancy b - usually safe but benefits must outweigh the risks.
in one of the typical ploys to increase profits, ibuprofen is touted as being less upsetting to the stomach and less likely to cause bleeding.
if correctly treated in a timely manner, most patients do not suffer significant sequelae.
antiemetics that do not decrease gastric motility or significantly alter mental status are the doc; anticholinergic drugs, such as prochlorperazine (compazine) are not considered beneficial, in part because of their propensity to cause both of these effects.
4) it lowers the incident of colon cancer approximately 50% (a retrospect study of over 600,000 people).
third, on a dose basis they equally lower prostaglandins, a blood factor involved in clotting and by this mechanism they reduce blood clots and consequently the incident of strokes caused by a blood clot and heart attacks so caused.
may be dripped slowly via nasogastric tube if severe nausea threatens administration.
2) because of this doctors are more likely to proscribe ibuprofen.
there is no advantage to buying a more expensive brand of acetasalasylic acid.
however, since no controlled studies have supported any alternative pediatric therapy, treatment in children should not be different than in adults.
3)      it is inexpensive compared to the more exotic nsaids.
2)      because of this doctors are more likely to proscribe ibuprofen.
acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine and metabolized by conjugation in the liver to nontoxic agents, which then are eliminated in the urine.
5) it lowers the incident of breast cancer 6) it dramatically lowers the incident of heart attacks—so much so that doctors routinely recommend taking one-a-day for those who are in the high risk group.
case series report that fewer than 4% of patients who suffer severe hepatotoxicity develop hepatic failure; fatalities or liver transplantation occur in less than one half of these patients.
they lack any effect upon the system of nerve sensor resulting in pain—an ability of the opiates.
therapy with nac has been shown to decrease mortality rates in late-presenting patients with fulminant hepatic failure (in the absence of acetaminophen in the serum).
why take ibuprofen 1) it has a better reputation than aspirin among the non-medical public.
3) it is inexpensive compared to the more exotic nsaids.
acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine and metabolized by conjugation in the liver to nontoxic agents, which then are eliminated in the urine.
furthermore, acetaminophen is found as a component of combination drugs such as propoxyphene-acetaminophen (eg, darvocet) and oxycodone-acetaminophen (eg, percocet).
4)  it lowers the incident of colon cancer approximately 50% (a retrospect study of over 600,000 people).
in general pain diminishes over time, that even acetopmetaphin seems to work.
early after overdose, nac prevents the formation and accumulation of napqi.
drug name n-acetylcysteine (mucomyst) -- doc for prevention and treatment of acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity.
repeat dose if vomiting occurs within 1 h of nac administration.
precautions not very effective in poisonings of ethanol, methanol, and iron salts; induce emesis before administering activated charcoal; after emesis with ipecac, patient may not tolerate activated charcoal for 1-2 h; can administer in early stages of gastric lavage; without sorbitol, gastric lavage returns are black; adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, and aspiration if the airway is not secure; monitor for bowel sounds to minimize risk of charcoal ileus drug category: antidote --
third, on a dose basis they equally lower prostaglandins, a blood factor involved in clotting and by this mechanism they reduce blood clots and consequently the incident of strokes caused by a blood clot and heart attacks so caused.
adult dose 0.15 mg/kg or 8 mg iv q8h, not to exceed 3 doses pediatric dose 0.15 mg/kg iv q 8h, not to exceed 3 doses contraindications documented hypersensitivity interactions although cytochrome p-450 inducers (barbiturates, rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin) may potentially change half-life and clearance of ondansetron, dosage adjustment is not usually required pregnancy b - usually safe but benefits must outweigh the risks.
approved by the fda for po administration but is also administered iv, especially when po nac is not tolerated due to refractory vomiting.
there is no advantage to buying a more expensive brand of acetasalasylic acid.
network of pores present in activated charcoal adsorbs 100-1000 mg of drug per gram of charcoal.
does not dissolve in water.
administer all doses, even if acetaminophen level has dropped below toxic range.
the maximum daily dose of apap is 4 g in adults and 90 mg/kg in children.
pediatric patients younger than 5 years appear to fare better than adults after apap poisoning, perhaps owing to a greater capacity to conjugate acetaminophen, enhanced detoxification of napqi, or greater glutathione stores.
gastrointestinal bleeding both ibuprofen and aspirin cause gastrointestinal bleeding because they are chemical that are irritating and the dosages is high (325 mg or more for aspirin, 400 & 800 mg for ibuprofen).
the toxic dose of apap after a single acute ingestion is 150 mg/kg or approximately 7 g in adults, although the at-risk dose may be lower in persons with alcoholism and other susceptible individuals.
for maximum hepatoprotective effect, administer within 8-24 h of acetaminophen ingestion.
early after overdose, nac prevents the formation and accumulation of napqi.
mortality/morbidity: the majority of patients with apap overdose survive with supportive care in conjunction with antidotal therapy.
5)  it lowers the incident of breast cancer 6)      it dramatically lowers the incident of heart attacks—so much so that doctors routinely recommend taking one-a-day for those who are in the high risk group.

under conditions of excessive napqi formation or reduced glutathione stores, napqi is free to covalently bind to vital proteins and the lipid bilayer of hepatocytes; this results in hepatocellular death and subsequent centrilobular liver necrosis.
why take aspirin 1) it has been used for a longer period of time and has no major side effects other than intestinal bleeding, and this can be avoid quite effectively by taking coated aspirin, where they.
adult dose 1 g/kg po or 10 times the amount of drug ingested pediatric dose administer as in adults contraindications documented hypersensitivity; poisoning or overdosage of mineral acids and alkalies; unprotected airway with absent gag reflex interactions may inactivate ipecac syrup if used concomitantly; effectiveness of other medications decreases with coadministration; do not mix with sherbet, milk, or ice cream (decreases adsorptive properties) pregnancy c - safety for use during pregnancy has not been established.
the expectations greatly exceed the reality.
pain relief in general pain diminishes over time, that even acetopmetaphin seems to work.
expect minimal benefit if administered >4 h postingestion.
causes: lab studies: imaging studies: procedures: prehospital care: stabilize immediate life-threatening conditions and initiate supportive care.
excess apap is then metabolized in the liver via the mixed function oxidase p450 system to a toxic metabolite,n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone-imine (napqi).

phenothiazines also may add to the toxicity associated with other anticholinergic drugs, which are often in apap-containing formulations.
they lack any effect upon the system of nerve sensor resulting in pain—an ability of the opiates.
about 85% of the strokes are a result of a blood clot and 60% of the heart attacks.
however, as a patient's history often is inaccurate, the serum acetaminophen concentration is important for diagnosis and treatment, even in the absence of symptoms.
is generally doc due to lower cost than ondansetron (zofran).
