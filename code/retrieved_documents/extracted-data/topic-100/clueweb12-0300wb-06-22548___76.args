to quote the introduction: the data catalog is both a catalog and a library of datasets, i.e. it both helps you figure out which data you want, and helps you work with the data.
since four-dimensional data cannot be directly displayed on a flat computer screen, it is necessary to reduced the dimensionality of the data before it is displayed.
the library functions allow data storage, retrieval and queries using a single applications interface, regardless of the data's source and organization.
the library functions allow data storage, retrieval and queries using a single applications interface, regardless of the data's source and organization.
stretched rectangular grids (which occur when the stretching along a given coordinate is a function only of the value of that coordinate) can be accommodated by specifying one-dimensional arrays containing the grid-point locations along the stretched coordinate as part of the ive input data.
for read-only access to existing netcdf data, the csiro interface has a simpler syntax than the netcdf toolbox, but the latter may also be used to create and manipulate netcdf variables and datasets.
the library is freely available and the source code is released under an mit-style library license.
unidata's integrated data viewer (idv) is a java application (for java 1.4 or later) that can be used to display a variety of netcdf files, particularly well formatted, geolocated datasets.
data may also be filtered and saved to a local netcdf file.
it does require licensing on a per computer basis, but the license is at no cost.

it allows one to feed the data contained in netcdf variables (or hdf4 sds) to the tools designed to operate on either ascii (text) or raw (binary) data.
dx supports a number of non-graphical functions such as point-wise mathematical expressions (e.g., arithmetic, transcendental, boolean, type conversion, etc.), univariate statistics and image processing (e.g., transformation, filter, warp, edge detection, convolution, equalization, blending, morphological operations, etc.).
