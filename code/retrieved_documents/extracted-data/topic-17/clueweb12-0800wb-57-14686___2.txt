i think that i spelled those breeds right.
my last little dog who died sat almost touching me hours every day while i worked on the computer.
i think it has quite a bit to do with unconditional love.

the above is a fairly recent picture of hank the ewok and lucy the bichon.
i've had dogs all of my life, and all of them have been good dogs.
we treat our dogs extremely well.
the cat was just recently dropped off on us.
i found him as a abandoned puppy along side the road.

they've been considerable work as puppies - but worth every minute.

none of that kitty-kitty stuff for them.
he turns the touch lamp off at night for me and if i drop something on the floor will get it for me.
they follow us around and want to be with us doing everything.
» we were without dogs for awhile after our last elderly dog had to be put to sleep from cancer.
posting a picture of your dog is just fine.
sometimes they appear to listen and grief with us, know what we need, or enjoy the view.
these little guys have already brought us a lot of joy.

i fed him mighty dog food and gave him lots of love, and so he managed to grow into a big dog, although the vet said he would be beagle sized.
my dogs and i explored the woods in winter and summer.
i love walking in the woods and enjoy the company of a big dog.

many of our dogs have lived to over 15, and that's pretty old for a dog.
trained not to harm animals we both gazed with wonder at deer and baby fawns, groundhogs, and turkeys and even fish in the streams.

i don't get out much because of disability, and he's been a great little companion for me when my wife is gone.
they give us a lot more than we give them.
i would say that the breed information was correct that they are wonderful companion dogs.

it took us awhile to get her over the grieving process of missing my brother but she has become a really great companion, too.
i'm  positive that they already love us and we love them.
"guard and protection" weren't on the list of concerns.
my little dog i have now has a white face, and he's a big baby.

she is just a baby but already very well behaved in just a few weeks.
our puppies are already well-established members of the family.
every once in a while though i've found a cat that behaves more like a dog.
we didn't think we would be able to handle another one for awhile, but it turns out that it was good for us to get a couple of puppies.
it was good for them also since they got out of those cages and had two humans to train.

safety is often an issue anymore and usually people don't miss with you if you have a big dog at your side.
they would greet me at the door just like a dog would.
he was so ill the vet told me he was not expected to live.
we wanted healthy, non-shedding, non-allergenic, loving, companion type dogs that live a long time and are great with small children.
the loss of our last little dog after 18 years was really hard, but we have many special memories.
but cats do what they want when they feel like it all the time.

we adopted the other dog when my brother passed on.

he cries every time we go anywhere even for a few minutes.
the bichon looks like a white toy poodle, and the shih tzu looks like a small ewok on star wars.

most of my life i have had pets, birds and turtles, and a few cats, but dogs are better companions.

she has been adopted by our female dog which has never had babies of her own.
dogs enjoy being with people and listen and respond better than cats.
we did some research about breeds and thought it would be some time before we would get another dog.
they've also been a ton of fun.
some who don't understand would say that my wife and i were silly, but i'll just say that we loved them.
watched them grow up, laughed at the silly things they did as kittens, and spent winter evenings helping my favorite cat raid the hen house in search of mice.
i too know the loss of a good dog that spent 10 years by my side.
he even makes a noise like singing from time to time when i pet him, and i do spoil him rotten.

the loss of our  last little dog after 18 years was really hard, but we have many special  memories.
if i worked in the garden one of them would climb on my shoulder and watch.
for the most part that is very true.
i am sure they will bring you such joy, as dogs do.
by the way, your dog is beautiful.
it is pretty heart-breaking when  they pass away, but you at least know they had a good home and someone who  loved them.
you sound like a person who understands making a dog part of the  family.
we get home and he acts like we've been gone for days.
