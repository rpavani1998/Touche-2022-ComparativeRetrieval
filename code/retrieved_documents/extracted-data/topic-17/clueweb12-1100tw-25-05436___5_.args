dogs really do understand us best against the conventional wisdom that music is a uniquely human phenomenon, ongoing research shows that animals actually do have the capacity for music.research led by deborah wells, a psychologist at queen's university belfast, shows that dogs can discern between human music of different genres.studies show that animals generally respond to human music with a total lack of interest.dogs are tougher nuts to crack, mostly because breeds vary widely in size, vocal range and heart rate.however, large dogs such as labradors or mastiffs have vocal ranges that are quite similar to those of adult male humans.however, large dogs such as labradors or mastiffs have vocal ranges that are quite similar to those of adult male humans."our own research has shown that dogs certainly behave differently in response to different types of music, e.g., showing behaviors more suggestive of relaxation in response to classical music and behaviors more suggestive of agitation in response to heavy metal music," wells wrote in an email."we find that cats prefer to listen to the music composed in their frequency range and tempo rather than human music."we find that cats prefer to listen to the music composed in their frequency range and tempo rather than human music."[dogs play the piano in new video] indeed, some dogs do appear to respond emotionally to human music."i have found that animals have very good absolute pitch, but they don't have relative pitch.but no matter how well composers perfect their dog, cat and monkey songs, the animals will probably never appreciate their species-specific music quite as much ashumans appreciate ours."we have a very human tendency to project onto our pets and assume that they will like what we like," said charles snowdon, an authority on the musical preferences of animals.humans like music that falls within our acoustic and vocal range, uses tones we understand, and progresses at a tempo similar to that of our heartbeats.snowdon and teie have moved on to composing music for cats, and studying how they respond to it.
