in fact, ka elsewhere is arguing the reverse, that while cam may be offering placebo and other non-specific medical benefits these can equally well occur within the 5-15 minute hurly-burly of the typical present day medical practice, i am sure they can, with good doctors, but i would love to be quite sure about the “equally”.
i suppose that describing someone’s lack of knowledge of science-based medicine, or belief in shamanism, as ‘primitive’ might be acceptable, although i still think a better choice of words might be ‘non-scientific belief system’ or some such, as clunky as that is.
i am talking about feelings and perceptions here, things i get the impression skeptics have difficulty dealing with, things i think have to be used to communicate with the general public.
they know what we mean when we write “woo,” and they ought to feel the sting of the insult.
i assume that homeopathy is traditional in many european countries like germany, france, belgium and england where even the queen is said to carry her little black box of homeo “remedies” when she travels.
like my doctor, he believed them and never tried to verify their claims.
yes, that’s what i was going for – the similarity in emotional/cultural roles.
the principles governing scientific reasoning and belief are negative as well as positive, and they imply that occult doctrines are not worthy of belief.
i think that one of the down-sides to playing shaman and giving a placebo is that true alternatives such as psychotherapy or a good exercise program are missed and the person then ends up remaining tired and dragged out rather than making the life-style changes that they need or participating in evidence-based cognitive-behavioural therapy.
these days such studies even often include quality-adjusted life year (qaly) measurements so that all aspects of patient life can bear upon a precise, measurement-based, final judgment.
when discussing quackery, i hate the skeptic’s use of the word woo because i think that the people you should be trying to reach don’t understand it and when they do they will think you are talking down your noses at them.
shamans derive their influence from playing, in essence, the same role as ministers or priests in their society.
it keeps you from understanding the depth of the problem and all the forces involved.
# rjstan@together.net on 01 aug 2008 at 6:45 pm dr. a, “those in our culture, with occasional exceptions, were not brought up to believe in “cam.”
most of them are vacuous; they are banalities of orthodox medicine, or they have no medical content and no applicability to any possible practice of medicine; they merely sound nice.
in part, a banal rhetoric about the physician as consoler;… in part, familiar and rather useless admonitions about not overlooking the abundance of circumstances that may contribute to one condition or another.
a physician engineer cannot honestly claim powers of magic or occult knowledge.
i think for many people living today psychotherapy replaced religion but it didn’t help many with their psychological and emotional needs and now many are looking to medicine to do that, and of course, they will be disappointed again.
supplements are not the only part of cam but they are the common denominator, the fuel that runs the industry, the billion $$ money maker.
engineers need not care in principle whether the generalizations on which they rely are psychological, physical, or psychophysical; what they care about is that the generalizations be applicable and that their reliability be scientifically demonstrated.
i do not write about religious beliefs, for example.
if physicians were more attentive to science and ethics and to explaining things to patients, politicians, and the media, more people would know that.
surveys routinely show that the majority of cam-using patients express great satisfaction with them.
i reject, as i hope i made clear above, the false dichotomy that for each health problem there is either a proven treatment or there is “cam.”
yet i have suggested that healthfrauders routinely exaggerate the risks of cam, that some potential dangers are not realized much in practice, and it again needs to be said that the medical risks depend very much upon the specific “quack” claim.
i countered with my own opinion that honesty and integrity are necessary parts of any discussion with a patient, and that they, in turn, must not conflict with science and reason.
if you are about to have major surgery, you may acquiesce to anything you think the surgeon approves of.
i was quite struck by them, for i have had very similar personal experiences and observed them in many patients.
modern medicine does no such thing, and could not even if it wanted to, since descartes held no such view.
ka # hermano on 03 aug 2008 at 9:39 pm dr. moran is indeed “muy simpático”.
we would still be able to describe hulda clark as a dangerous and severely deluded cancer quack, or, if you prefer, an unspeakable criminal fraud.
he made motz part of his team and allowed her to introduce a macrobiotic diet, acupuncture, hypnosis, aromatherapy, changing light from fluorescent to incandescent, and cleaning the floors only with natural cleansers.
i’ll try and find a better word than “primitive” but just about any word i can think of seems likely to be regarded as pejorative by those who see much to prize in the medical beliefs of ancient cultures.
it is lying to make a buck.
they can explain that they contain nothing but water, alcohol or sugar till the cows come home, but there will still be many people who will believe that they work and will want to buy them.
i had to write mine piecemeal, and couldn’t look to see if you had answered without losing mine.
what this adds up to is that the public may not be (generally) as indiscriminate in their use of alternative methods and as in need of protection from unscientific concepts as we healthfrauders like to think.
they can explain that they contain nothing but water, alcohol or sugar till the cows come home, but there will still be many people who will believe that they work and will want to buy them.

the new england journal of medicine disappoints on 22 aug 2008 at 8:00 am [...] it published the best article about pseudomedicine ever to appear in a mainstream journal, which i quoted extensively a couple of weeks ago (if i were king, that article would be reprinted each year or so).
he credits the photos and the information to the crookes laboratory.
this is the very reason why i have an interest in examining the kind of messages we are putting out.
i was the victim of the drug company that published fraudulent ads.
in fact, at least one medical ethicist has gone so far as to state that it is not unethical for a doctor to prescribe a placebo treatment, so long as the doctor believes it will benefit the patient.
i don’t mean to suggest that religion is equivalent to shamanism, only that the md is responding to the patient’s request for psycological/spiritual/cultural support from someone the patient trusts.
sure, on its face it makes sense to use something that works without regard to why it works, but that’s a deceptive way to look at what oz, an enthusiastic big kid with a solid background in cardiac surgery but none in critical thinking, is doing: “return[ing] the practice of medicine to the practice of magic and…replac[ing] logic and method with occultism and obfuscation.”
we would still be able to describe hulda clark as a dangerous and severely deluded cancer quack, or, if you prefer, an unspeakable criminal fraud.
it would be nice to be able to convince large numbers of people to stop using silly therapies, but that’s a tall order.
colloidal silver, by no stretch of the imagination a dietary supplement, is also both woo and fraud.
it need not be introduced in an unjustified or insulting way, i.e., by implying that the patient’s symptoms are “all in her head” or are “functional” or whatever.
because many patients become the victims of quackery does not negate the fact that the epidemic of cam we are now experiencing started with the general public and worked its way up to scientific institutions.
all the studies i’ve seen show that a huge number of people is spending a huge amount of money on supplements which they believe or hope offer health benefits.
the mere fact that holistic medicine is widespread and enduring is no reason to take its claims seriously; superstition, self-deception, stupidity, and fraud are ubiquitous and always have been.
if i were he, my greatest concern would be that rational patients would think that he was as wacky as motz sounds.

ka in julie motz’s book she says oz credited her with the success when a transplanted heart started beating, saying he didn’t know what she did in there, but he’d never seen a heart come back so fast.
we are also fairly obviously more deeply offended by it than most, which can lead to confirmation bias.
one of the larger books of this kind was even subsidized by the national institute of mental health.
depression, for instance, has emerged as one of the major risk factors in the recovery of heart patients after surgery.
an example is studies designed to determine the optimum dose of a noxious chemotherapeutic agent, so that cancer remissions are produced at acceptable risk.
if homeo “remedies” are traditional there, i assume the public knows the theory behind them.
i agree that people can do what they want.
david gorski wrote: actually, religion is more or less equivalent to shamanism.
until you understand the general public and speak their language you will not be able to educate them or do much to stop cam from taking over the world.

they’ll tend to be more knowledgable on average than the tribesman, but it’s a difference of degree, not kind.
ka seems to help my argument with personal medical experiences that are reminiscent of some of stories of “alternative” testimonial.
depending on the circumstances, it may or may not be appropriate for the md to tell the tribesman/patient that the potion/homeopathy is almost certainly worthless.
just as he would have a duty to advise against going to a laetrile clinic.
i got a copy of his book which looks to me like a reputable textbook on colloid chemistry published in 1938.
the holistic practitioner sees the body in much the same way that magicians of old viewed the universe.
sure, some of his clients may eventually realize that he is actually a nutcase, but even most of those will probably find ways in which they think he has helped them.
moreover, physician engineers have no immunity to moral or ethical constraints.
if he wants to test the hypothesis that emotional and psychological factors affect the outcome of surgery, then he should test that hypothesis, not bring a ditzy magical thinker into the operating room to violate the privacy of the patient and to distract and embarrass the many other practitioners involved (if i were an anesthesiologist in such a situation, i’d refuse if asked and i’d be livid if i hadn’t been asked).
the only real reason i can see for treating the witch doctor/tribesman situation differently is that the tribesman’s knowledge may be more limited.
the most important elements are that the practitioner be attentive and appear to give a damn.
sure, they have money, but so does “big tobacco.”
if you don’t care, if it really is woo that you want to focus on, that is your privilege, but i personally am concerned about the bigger picture, about nonsense being served up and charged for in scientific institutions as if it were supported by solid evidence as well as about the terrific harm snake oil does to real people.
imo, claiming that scientific medicine is the sole province of white males and the west is about as prejudiced as you can get since it implies that the rest of us are too dumb to recognize and embrace the great benefits scientific medicine has offered the world and the great promise it still offers it.
imo, the only way that we can really have a major impact and protect the public is to have many people actually learn enough about supplements to recognize fraud when it occurs and expose it.
many were injured by supplements they bought after reading fraudulent ads.
the reason is that it really doesn’t discriminate if you remember that till not much more than 100 years ago everyone including all the ancestors of everyone living today used primitive or pre-scientific medicine and crude non-standardized remedies, some of which were utterly useless, some dangerous and some just very unreliable.
# harriet hall on 01 aug 2008 at 6:14 pm the book “hands of life” describes how intuitive energy healer julie motz was accepted into dr. oz’s operating rooms as part of his cardiac surgery team.
“dr. a, “there are plenty of modern physicians whose patients are not disposed to look elsewhere” if that were true, there wouldn’t be a billion $$ supplement industry.
maybe we skeptics encounter a disproportionate amount of the dangerous and nutty extremes of “alternative” medicine because we go looking for it and we hang about on forums that gather it.
he was definitely naive in that he believed the ads in an era when drug companies were not strictly regulated, but according to my definition, he was not a quack.
the most compelling, in my opinion, is his point about “calling in witch doctors.”
however, holistic medicine is not a scientific tradition.
an example is studies designed to determine the optimum dose of a noxious chemotherapeutic agent, so that cancer remissions are produced at acceptable risk.
if physicians learn relatively fewer generalizations that are entirely psychological or social in nature or that posit psychological mechanisms for physical effects, the reason is not that such generalizations are alien to the “medical model” but that relatively few of them are applicable and scientifically warranted.
we are also fairly obviously more deeply offended by it than most, which can lead to confirmation bias.
a great deal of what physicians learn consists of biologic and biochemical generalizations, broadly construed, but they also learn a substantial body of psychophysical generalizations which can be regarded as bridging the crevasse between mind and body.
on the other hand, being happy is a major component of recovery–i’ve lapsed on my reading on how the nervous system affects the immune system, but as of 2005 (the last year that i followed this closely) the studies seemed to to be pointing towards stress actually lowering immune cell counts and other objective measurements of immune function.
ok, but if he’s not going to do research and is not using any control group, he has no right to make the claims he is making for the efficacy of the woo.
that science provides a clear discrimination between what works and what doesn’t.

you said, “if he wants to test the hypothesis that emotional and psychological factors affect the outcome of surgery, then he should test that hypothesis, not bring a ditzy magical thinker into the operating room to violate the privacy of the patient…” first, if the article reported correctly, the patient was very pleased with the “ditzy magical thinker”.
dr. a, “every pharmacy in europe that advertises “homeopathie” is committing fraud, plain and simple.”
i suspect that if you look at the names of the researchers in most major scientific institutions and journals, you will find that a great many come from non-western cultures.
i think that it is the general public that has gotten politicians, doctors and scientific institutions to offer cam and that it was the marketers in the dietary supplement industry that got the public to do that.”
everything i hear you and several of your colleagues say sounds like you are horrified by woo and think that cam = woo, that cam is caused by woo and that if only all mds were “critical thinkers” woo would vanish at least from scientific institutions.
that science provides a clear discrimination between what works and what doesn’t.
dr. a, “patients are not the problem; they are, if you’ll excuse the drama, the victims.”
the same shelves boast best-selling books on holistic medicine authored by professors at distinguished medal schools and, in at least one case, by a physician administrator at the national institutes of health.
i think that in addition to irrational beliefs there are psychological, emotional and financial reasons why patients and mds resort to unscientific medicine.
i don’t mean to suggest that religion is equivalent to shamanism, only that the md is responding to the patient’s request for psycological/spiritual/cultural support from someone the patient trusts.
if i were the patient, i’d be angry as a hornet if he even suggested such a thing.
i agree that in all contexts, some versions of fraud are more dangerous than others.
rjstan said, “in addition to irrational beliefs there are psychological, emotional and financial reasons why patients and mds resort to unscientific medicine…humans have emotional and psychological needs, many of which are not being met.”
rosemary, here are more responses: all i’m trying to do is point out that the picture is much bigger than “woo” and that the danger of snake oil is far greater than accepting irrational beliefs.

if you limit your exposes to irrational beliefs you will have a much narrower audience and much smaller impact than if you expose fraud.

first, if it can be shown that something works to improve the outcome of surgery, oz will use it without regard to why it works.
superficially this is a powerful line of argument, because we can fairly easily find instances where such predictions are fulfilled.
k & m are having here.
people are self medicating.
this view is also context sensitive since considerable scientific evidence suggests the likelihood of symptom relief by the placebo medicines of cam and from interactions with cam practitioners.

such candor serves to maintain my view of him as our “conscience,” even as it makes me optimistic that we might dissuade him from making those positions permanent.
as magicians, they possess magical powers either because of the occult knowledge they possess or simply because of who they are—for example, because they stand in some special relation to gods or demons.
what this adds up to is that the public may not be (generally) as indiscriminate in their use of alternative methods and as in need of protection from unscientific concepts as we healthfrauders like to think.
there are plenty of modern physicians whose patients are not disposed to look elsewhere, even if those patients have “nonspecific tiredness and unhappiness” and even if those physicians don’t suggest woo.
all i’m trying to do is point out that the picture is much bigger than “woo” and that the danger of snake oil is far greater than accepting irrational beliefs.
i subscribe to a lot of cam stuff*, admittedly, but that’s going too far.
it is a bad thing because, to quote ka, “implausible claims being promoted, tacitly or otherwise” leads to ” unnecessary expense, a patient later feeling betrayed by her physician when the treatment doesn’t work or the “placebo effect” wears off and she realizes that it was only a “pretend medicine” all along, other patients or physicians concluding that the treatments have validity (and possibly being convinced to forgo rational treatment), people in general losing confidence in modern medicine when it appears that many physicians can’t distinguish between the rational and the bogus, wasted research funds, human subjects unnecessarily duped and endangered, a befuddled media a befuddled public befuddled leglislators endorsing quacks to a befuddled public.”
imo, claiming that scientific medicine is the sole province of white males and the west is about as prejudiced as you can get since it implies that the rest of us are too dumb to recognize and embrace the great benefits scientific medicine has offered the world and the great promise it still offers it.
and like peter, i have no objection to patients using unscientific treatments as long as they can give informed consent.

they dispense with cultural relativism, another favorite refuge of imc advocates, and demolish the ”differing paradigms of thomas kuhn” contrivance: holistic advocates repeatedly cite kuhn and claim that holistic medicine is an alternative paradigm with its own standards, one that cannot be understood or assessed by the practitioners of orthodox medicine.
the claim to diagnose by examining the eye or to cure by massaging the foot is completely bogus; we know more than enough about the workings of the body to be reasonably certain that geometric features of the iris, for instance, do not provide the specific information about disorders that iridologists claim they do….of course, it is conceivable that the beliefs of scientific medicine are in error about one or another of these matters, but that is no reason for using public funds to investigate holistic claims.
the authors expose the fallacy of the argument that “holistic medicine has not really been investigated, that funds ought to be made available for conducting tests of holistic practices, and that meanwhile we should keep our minds open about holistic techniques.”
proponents of unscientific medicine often erroneously claim that scientific medicine is based on a system of cultural beliefs held by arrogant, nasty, prejudiced, euro-centric, white men who favor white coats, ties and stethoscopes.
the silver quacks quote p. 538 of hartman’s book where he says something like silver has been found safe enough to put into the eyes and

quacks who are not physicians have also been kept in check, until recently, by governmental pressures.

i see nothing wrong with that, even if the md disbelieves in both shamanism and religion.
in part, a banal rhetoric about the physician as consoler;… in part, familiar and rather useless admonitions about not overlooking the abundance of circumstances that may contribute to one condition or another.

we keep on offering the public temporary answers to these things, prescribing (historically) amphetamines, cocaine, opiates, barbiturates and phenothiazines in massive quantities, only to take them away when problems such as addiction ensue.
the only real reason i can see for treating the witch doctor/tribesman situation differently is that the tribesman’s knowledge may be more limited.
we scientists are ever-so cautious when making scientific judgments about complex matters; let’s not pretend that arriving at absolutes in medical ethics is a piece of cake, especially when it is not quite clear how anything done with the undiluted welfare of the individual patient in mind can be entirely unethical.
that people of ordinary intelligence and experience can nevertheless almost instinctively sense the weaknesses and exaggerations in some of our habitual arguments.

ka dr. moran is indeed “muy simpático”.
when i read this, i thought that the doctor had a lot of very frightened, nervous patients who he didn’t want to deal with so he called in the “healers” to calm them for him.
these distinctions are more logical than sociological, and a society may combine several of them in the roles it assigns to healers.
i read one and it didn’t say anything about drinking silver.
dr. a, “by your own description, there was no “dietary supplement industry” as it now exists when your doctor treated you with silver.
too many people seem willing to swallow the rhetoric—even too many medical doctors—and the results will not be benign.
i am a strong believer in evidence based medicine and i have great respect for the authors on this site for their incredible knowledge, intelligence, talent and high ethical standards, but i think there is a very nasty epidemic out there called cam affecting the majority of people in many industrialized countries.
is it right to then turn around and say, well you didn’t really need these things anyway, even denying them any relief that they may derive from “pretend medicines”.
and please remember that many victims of quackery were not injured by bad practitioners of scientific medicine.
you will only be talking to each other.
in his training and skill oz personified the prowess of western medical science; in his experience he understood its limitations.
when i heard that silver was being sold as a supplement, i asked the salesmen how they knew it was safe and effective.
i agree that describing science-based medicine as ‘western’ was poor phrasing; it was force of habit on my part (although i was unaware that others have used this phrase to denigrate the scientific approach to medicine).
the standard healthfraud position is that even if cam may sometimes be helpful to people, it is a bad thing regarding which there can be no compromise.
doctors cannot do what they want.
“dr. a, “point 3 also brings psychotherapy to mind.”
the difference between us is that i insist that medicine is about an infinite number of individual contexts and i see many examples where ethical absolutes (actually these are ethical guidelines rather than directives) do not apply or don’t seem to apply very well.
from glymour and stalker: the principles governing scientific reasoning and belief are negative as well as positive, and they imply that occult doctrines are not worthy of belief.
as i’ve said repeatedly, supplements are the fuel that runs the entire alt.
i get the impression you weigh all silly, nonsense equally.
in the meantime, there is the unnecessary expense, a patient later feeling betrayed by her physician when the treatment doesn’t work or the “placebo effect” wears off and she realizes that it was only a “pretend medicine” all along, other patients orphysicians concluding that the treatments have validity (and possiblybeing convinced to forgo rational treatment), people in general losing confidence in modern medicine when it appears that many physicians can’t distinguishbetween the rational and the bogus, wasted research funds, human subjects unnecessarily duped and endangered, a befuddled media, a befuddled public, befuddled leglislators endorsing quacks to a befuddled public, and more.
just as he would have a duty to advise against going to a laetrile clinic.
these days such studies even often include quality-adjusted life year (qaly) measurements so that all aspects of patient life can bear upon a precise, measurement-based, final judgment.
as far as i’m concerned people and doctors can do what they want to themselves and consenting adults but they have to be honest about it.
the reason i am being a bit stubborn about these matters is that i have what is as yet merely a vague inkling that they are important — that they may, despite initial appearances, help rather than damage our purposes.
and the good quacks could easily fool the best critical thinker if he didn’t begin by checking the facts, a task that can get overwhelming very quickly and which is the main reason why the person making the claim has to substantiate it.

almost all “dietary supplement” marketing claims are woo, in that they are not backed by anything close to reasonable evidence.
i believe this word was intended to describe a person not educated in ‘western’ science or medicine, and the challenges involved in communicating with such a person might certainly be daunting.
if the patient shares the shaman’s religious beliefs and views him/her as a priest in his religion, then calling in the shaman is quite equivalent to calling in a priest to comfort the patient.
# hermano on 03 aug 2008 at 10:21 pm rosemary, i understand you consider it unethical for the naturopaths to sell supplements to their patients.
there were ads that made it look as if he were alive and well and working today.
my point about the failure of psychotherapy is that human beings have emotional and psychological needs that aren’t being met in today’s
the selling of woo, whether for financial gain or not, is fraud.
many were injured by supplements they bought after reading fraudulent ads.
this will certainly affect any efforts to advise him regarding useless or potentially harmful potions.
rather, the honest physician will admit to not being able to explain the symptoms, but acknowledge that they must be distressing and suggest that it might be helpful to discuss how they impinge on the patient’s life and how she might better cope with them.
again, the physician may be understood to be someone who applies a reliable body of knowledge that is not warranted by science or by magic but is simply known and, so far as the community is concerned, always has been known.
to help convey that picture to the general public they sometimes call scientific medicine western medicine.
rosemary, i understand you consider it unethical for the naturopaths to sell supplements to their patients.
engineers need not care in principle whether the generalizations on which they rely are psychological, physical, or psychophysical; what they care about is that the generalizations be applicable and that their reliability be scientifically demonstrated.
the answer to point 3 is the same as the answer to point 2, and i certainly don’t mind if “people feel better for taking a multivitamin or an innocuous herb” (if that were the extent of “cam” we’d hardly be wasting our time here).
my favorite: “the work of cranks does not constitute a scientific revolution” words of wisdom.
he allows motz to tell patients they are responsible for their own illness, and she makes them act out the anger and relieve emotions that were going on in their life at the time their illness began.
i use honey instead of neosporin on my cuts, and eat a largely vegetarian diet–not because i think it’s healthier (which i do), but because i just happen to not like the taste of meat.
in last week’s post, i dubbed dr. peter moran the “conscience” of sbm, citing his commitment to doing what’s best for individual patients even if, in theory at least, that may involve some manner of benign but fanciful treatments.
more than willing — he felt ethically obliged.
when i read this, i thought that the doctor had a lot of very frightened, nervous patients who he didn’t want to deal with so he called in the “healers” to calm them for him.
patients are not the problem; they are, if you’ll excuse the drama, the victims.
ok, but if he’s not going to do research and is not using any control group, he has no right to make the claims he is making for the efficacy of the woo.
a medicine man can combine traditional therapies with magical claims, and both with a bit of consolation.
he was definitely naive in that he believed the ads in an era when drug companies were not strictly regulated, but according to my definition, he was not a quack.
i do not know if he believes in the nonsense as motz does or if he feels it relieves depression in specific patients and hopes that that will improve their surgical outcomes.
# rjstan@together.net on 04 aug 2008 at 5:27 am hermano, i think it should be illegal for anyone treating patients to sell them products for which they make health claims, and i do mean anyone, md, nd, dc, etc.
there could be one person spending billions on supplements or billions each spending 1 dollar.
by your own description, there was no “dietary supplement industry” as it now exists when your doctor treated you with silver.
all the studies i’ve seen show that a huge number of people is spending a huge amount of money on supplements which they believe or hope offer health benefits.
depending on the circumstances, it may or may not be appropriate for the md to tell the tribesman/patient that the potion/homeopathy is almost certainly worthless.
i don’t feel i can judge the doctor with today’s yardstick.
i think that it is the general public that has gotten politicians, doctors and scientific institutions to offer cam and that it was the marketers in the dietary supplement industry that got the public to do that.
in fact, at least one medical ethicist has gone so far as to state that it is not unethical for a doctor to prescribe a placebo treatment, so long as the doctor believes it will benefit the patient.
it has no paradigmatic work, no recognized set of problems, and no shared standards for what constitutes a solution to those problems; it also lacks the critical exchange among its practitioners that is characteristic of the sciences.
i lost all respect for oz when he fell for an old carnival trick and suggested that john of god was doing something to stimulate the pituitary when he stuck forceps up a patient’s nose.
someone needs to investigate these psychological factors, but a gullible believer in woo like dr. oz is not the one to do it.
i suppose that describing someone’s lack of knowledge of science-based medicine, or belief in shamanism, as ‘primitive’ might be acceptable, although i still think a better choice of words might be ‘non-scientific belief system’ or some such, as clunky as that is.
if a surgeon doing a high risk operation suspects that having a wacky woman wave her hands over the patient during the proceedure will calm the patient and seriously decrease the amount of depression she experiences afterwards, something he suspects will improve her chances of a good outcome, and invites the wacky woman to proceed, is that very different than a doctor at his wits
on the bottom of the same page, something the silver quacks never mention, he says that colloidal lead, another crookes product, has been successfully intecjed into cancerous tumors.
rather, the honest physician will admit to not being able to explain the symptoms, but acknowledge that they must be distressing and suggest that it might be helpful to discuss how they impinge on the patient’s life and how she might better cope with them.
one hopes they will speak bluntly, but it does no good to join forces with cranks and quacks, magicians and madmen.
if there were new approaches that might improve the quality of life of cardiac patients, oz was willing to raise some eyebrows to evaluate them and do what he could to nudge a major medical center in new directions.
a medicine man can combine traditional therapies with magical claims, and both with a bit of consolation.
there are, moreover, plenty of rational, nonpharmacological treatments for all manner of minor or self-limiting complaints (and even for not so self-limiting complaints, such as chronic pain), e.g., gargling with hot water or sipping hot tea, time, avoiding environmental allergens, smoking cessation, weight loss, ice packs or heat packs, rest, exercise, massage (to make muscles feel better, not to “remove toxins”), pain management, physical therapy, eating more fibre, “sleep hygiene,” and many more.
i recognize that the proper ethical course won’t always be easy or obvious.
they probably realize it already, and that’s just not going to help.
it is a bad thing because, to quote ka, “implausible claims being promoted, tacitly or otherwise” leads to ” unnecessary expense, a patient later feeling betrayed by her physician when the treatment doesn’t work or the “placebo effect” wears off and she realizes that it was only a “pretend medicine” all along, other patients or physicians concluding that the treatments have validity (and possibly being convinced to forgo rational treatment), people in general losing confidence in modern medicine when it appears that many physicians can’t distinguish between the rational and the bogus, wasted research funds, human subjects unnecessarily duped and endangered, a befuddled media a befuddled public befuddled leglislators endorsing quacks to a befuddled public.”
my writing is aimed not at every person who dabbles in “supplements,” but at people who should know better, such as some physicians, some medical school deans and other administrators, some scientists at the nih, and some legislators.
if i were the patient, i’d be angry as a hornet if he even suggested such a thing.
patients who suffer from coronary heart disease may be treated with beta blockers and antiplatelet drugs, and they may also be advised to change their work, their diet, their smoking habits, their exercise habits, and their living conditions.
if physicians cannot distinguish relevant from irrelevant factors, important from unimportant causes, then they can do nothing.
like all medical schools, columbia’s is grappling with the high cost of specialized medical treatment.
if i were he, my greatest concern would be that rational patients would think that he was as wacky as motz sounds.
if the claim were valid, holistic practice would have to constitute a scientific tradition, albeit one in competition with the tradition of orthodox medicine.
one such conception is that physicians are consolers.

she tells them they are bringing treatments such as surgery into their lives in order to relive their traumas, including prenatal traumas.
yet i have suggested that healthfrauders routinely exaggerate the risks of cam, that some potential dangers are not realized much in practice, and it again needs to be said that the medical risks depend very much upon the specific “quack” claim.
more than willing — he felt ethically obliged.
cranks have been common throughout the history of science, as kuhn, a distinguished historian of science, knew well.
the [...] holistic medicine is a pablum of common sense and nonsense offered by cranks and quacks and failed pedants who share an attachment to magic and an animosity toward reason.
that conventional medicine has adequate answers to all health problems and the public should be content with what it offers.
doctors who push “cam” are not honest.
i don’t think you understand where these people are coming from or speak their language.
however, many shamanistic cultures have incredibly complex social networks and family structures (for example) that are by no means ‘primitive’.
he made motz part of his team and allowed her to introduce a macrobiotic diet, acupuncture, hypnosis, aromatherapy, changing light from fluorescent to incandescent, and cleaning the floors only with natural cleansers.
modern medicine does no such thing, and could not even if it wanted to, since descartes held no such view.
the claim tacitly made by american or european physicians, and tacitly relied on by their patients, is that their palliatives and procedures have been shown by science to be effective.
if congress is actually successful in giving the fda the power to regulate tobacco(a terrible idea, in my opinion, but for reasons that have nothing to do with this discussion), “supplement” companies and advocates won’t have a leg to stand on.
again, the physician may be understood to be someone who applies a reliable body of knowledge that is not warranted by science or by magic but is simply known and, so far as the community is concerned, always has been known.
i was quite struck by them, for i have had very similar personal experiences and observed them in many patients.
supplement promoters, especially botanical promoters, are often brilliant, rational and know some science.
the work of cranks does not constitute a scientific revolution, and no cranks appear among kuhn’s many examples.
ka seems to help my argument with personal medical experiences that are reminiscent of some of stories of “alternative” testimonial.
and: the physician as expert consultant science, reason, ethics, and modern medicine, part 5: penultimate words 40 responses so far excellent post with much food for thought and some great sound bites.
he did not sell the drug he prescribed.
yes, it is true that this patient needs help, but if physicians held exclusively to that ethic they wouldn’t have to concern themselves with antibiotic resistance, universal immunizations, judicious use of expensive but very low yield tests that are physically harmless and paid for with pooled money, or other cost-containment issues that don’t immediately affect this patient, would they?
i simply can’t believe all that is in the patients’ best interests.
it is entirely the same with physicians, who must apply both explicit scientific principles and also a great deal of tacit knowledge to the treatment of their patients.
this will certainly affect any efforts to advise him regarding useless or potentially harmful potions.
it is entirely the same with physicians, who must apply both explicit scientific principles and also a great deal of tacit knowledge to the treatment of their patients.
shamans derive their influence from playing, in essence, the same role as ministers or priests in their society.
second, i think that if oz is the talented surgeon claimed and if he enjoys doing surgery, that that is what he should do.
# harriet hall on 02 aug 2008 at 10:05 pm rjstan said, “in addition to irrational beliefs there are psychological, emotional and financial reasons why patients and mds resort to unscientific medicine…humans have emotional and psychological needs, many of which are not being met.”
first, if it can be shown that something works to improve the outcome of surgery, oz will use it without regard to why it works.
the claim tacitly made by american or european physicians, and tacitly relied on by their patients, is that their palliatives and procedures have been shown by science to be effective.
we don’t care that they may be being used mainly when there is no entirely satisfactory evidence-based treatments for the complaint, nor that some of the methods may simply have not yet been subjected to sufficient study to be quite sure whether they have intrinsic medical activity or not.
he could sew bypass grafts and implant new hearts, but he was hard pressed to change the habits that put his patients on the operating table or to grapple with the emotional and psychological factors that might hasten their healing.
too many people seem willing to swallow the rhetoric—even too many medical doctors—and the results will not be benign.
on the contrary, they are by training and by culture enmeshed in a tradition of rational thought about the obligations and responsibilities of their profession.
i recognize that the proper ethical course won’t always be easy or obvious.
even if patients are victimized by themselves, it’s still up to an ethical physician to point that out.
however, i also believe that to refuse to acknolwedge and appreciate the huge pressure put on individual practitioners and institutions by patients deceived by marketing geniuses indicates a failure to see a big aspect of the problem.
of course i agree that “pleasing customers” is not a reason to deceive patients.
in the meantime, there is the unnecessary expense, a patient later feeling betrayed by her physician when the treatment doesn’t work or the “placebo effect” wears off and she realizes that it was only a “pretend medicine” all along, other patients orphysicians concluding that the treatments have validity (and possiblybeing convinced to forgo rational treatment), people in general losing confidence in modern medicine when it appears that many physicians can’t distinguishbetween the rational and the bogus, wasted research funds, human subjects unnecessarily duped and endangered, a befuddled media, a befuddled public, befuddled leglislators endorsing quacks to a befuddled public, and more.
if physicians learn relatively fewer generalizations that are entirely psychological or social in nature or that posit psychological mechanisms for physical effects, the reason is not that such generalizations are alien to the “medical model” but that relatively few of them are applicable and scientifically warranted.
promoting ”cam,” that “conventional medicine has adequate answers to all health problems.”
there are, moreover, plenty of rational, nonpharmacological treatments for all manner of minor or self-limiting complaints (and even for not so self-limiting complaints, such as chronic pain), e.g., gargling with hot water or sipping hot tea, time, avoiding environmental allergens, smoking cessation, weight loss, ice packs or heat packs, rest, exercise, massage (to make muscles feel better, not to “remove toxins”), pain management, physical therapy, eating more fibre, “sleep hygiene,” and many more.
i will not pull files.
for example, generalizations concerning the effects of drugs, correlating the location of pain with other physical symptoms of disease, and positing the causal factors in dizziness and senility connect the mental with the physical and are thus useful for medical engineering.
i don’t feel i can judge the doctor with today’s yardstick.
i just don’t think that physicians should make false claims.
it would be nice to be able to convince large numbers of people to stop using silly therapies, but that’s a tall order.
much taller than trying to convince modern physicians to stop encouraging the use of silly therapies.
the authors expose the fallacy of the argument that “holistic medicine has not really been investigated, that funds ought to be made available for conducting tests of holistic practices, and that meanwhile we should keep our minds open about holistic techniques.”
the most compelling, in my opinion, is his point about “calling in witch doctors.”
i agree that describing science-based medicine as ‘western’ was poor phrasing; it was force of habit on my part (although i was unaware that others have used this phrase to denigrate the scientific approach to medicine).
as i’ve said repeatedly, supplements are the fuel that runs the entire alt.
dr. a, “every pharmacy in europe that advertises “homeopathie” is committing fraud, plain and simple.
the second occurred many years later and was heralded not by a conversation, but by a diagnostic test: after a couple of months of excruciating neck pain, i had a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) study that showed that my cervical spine was normal.
if there were new approaches that might improve the quality of life of cardiac patients, oz was willing to raise some eyebrows to evaluate them and do what he could to nudge a major medical center in new directions.
i don’t mean to suggest that religion is equivalent to shamanism, only that the md is responding to the patient’s request for psycological/spiritual/cultural support from someone the patient trusts.
someone needs to investigate these psychological factors, but a gullible believer in woo like dr. oz is not the one to do it.
we expect skilled engineers to be able to learn from experience and to get better at building bridges, because we believe that their training has subjected them to a rational discipline that has made them good learners about such matters.
by not addressing that, you argue, we sbmers don’t have a chance to make much difference.
alternatively, if an md called in the witch doctor on his own initiative, that’s more problematic.
for example, generalizations concerning the effects of drugs, correlating the location of pain with other physical symptoms of disease, and positing the causal factors in dizziness and senility connect the mental with the physical and are thus useful for medical engineering.
proponents of unscientific medicine often erroneously claim that scientific medicine is based on a system of cultural beliefs held by arrogant, nasty, prejudiced, euro-centric, white men who favor white coats, ties and stethoscopes.
like all medical schools, columbia’s is grappling with the high cost of specialized medical treatment.
my favorite: “the work of cranks does not constitute a scientific revolution” words of wisdom.
as far as i’m concerned people and doctors can do what they want to themselves and consenting adults but they have to be honest about it.
many quacks are themselves physicians with no acceptable excuse, who until recently were kept in check by strong professional and governmental pressures, only to have found themselves reborn in a new “ golden age of quackery.”
there are plenty of modern physicians whose patients are not disposed to look elsewhere, even if those patients have “nonspecific tiredness and unhappiness” and even if those physicians don’t suggest woo.
because the article is not available online i’ve reproduced several passages: medicine in industrialized nations is scientific medicine.
yes, that’s what i was going for – the similarity in emotional/cultural roles.
i think for many people living today psychotherapy replaced religion but it didn’t help many with their psychological and emotional needs and now many are looking to medicine to do that, and of course, they will be disappointed again.
because of such notions, …holistic practitioners…are under no obligation, they believe, to reconcile their claims about therapy with what is known about the causal pathways of the body.
and the good quacks could easily fool the best critical thinker if he didn’t begin by checking the facts, a task that can get overwhelming very quickly and which is the main reason why the person making the claim has to substantiate it.
unless they tell customers that they are safe, they aren’t committing fraud.
their newfoundendorsement by governmental edict is no more justified than would be a similar endorsement of tribal witch doctors.
if i did, i’d get a copy of motz’s book and contact columbia to see if her statements are true.
much taller than trying to convince modern physicians to stop encouraging the use of silly therapies.
until you understand the general public and speak their language you will not be able to educate them or do much to stop cam from taking over the world.
sure, some of his clients may eventually realize that he is actually a nutcase, but even most of those will probably find ways in which they think he has helped them.
if they feel talked down to (assuming any of them even reads this stuff), that’s fine with me.
and like peter, i have no objection to patients using unscientific treatments as long as they can give informed consent.
if the patient shares the shaman’s religious beliefs and views him/her as a priest in his religion, then calling in the shaman is quite equivalent to calling in a priest to comfort the patient.
their sales are thus fraudulent.
as you point out, you wouldn’t call in a priest to minister to a jewish patient or an atheist, nor would you call in a rabbi to minister to a catholic.
i’m not excusing surgeons for asking a person to perform “healing touch” or anything so silly and implausible on a patient.
these distinctions are more logical than sociological, and a society may combine several of them in the roles it assigns to healers.
my objection is to lying to the patient, implying that a treatment is supported by evidence when it really isn’t.
by your own description, there was no “dietary supplement industry” as it now exists when your doctor treated you with silver.
i had to write mine piecemeal, and couldn’t look to see if you had answered without losing mine.
it keeps you from understanding the depth of the problem and all the forces involved.
# kimball atwood on 02 aug 2008 at 1:44 pm dr. moran’s hypothetical about witch doctors struck me as provocative, but after further consideration, i’m not sure it teaches us anything new.

sometimes, of course, we are disappointed.
dr. atwood, perhaps i sound contradictory because you see things as black or white and i see several shades of gray in between.
dr. a, “patients are not the problem; they are, if you’ll excuse the drama, the victims.”
actually, religion is more or less equivalent to shamanism.
superficially this is a powerful line of argument, because we can fairly easily find instances where such predictions are fulfilled.
but contrary to my initial impression, i don’t think the witch doctor example reveals anything new.
as i read the report the pain abated, never to return to its previous degree of severity.
i just don’t think that physicians should make false claims.
i located his articles that included photos of petri dishes with silver supposedly killing bacteria.
second, oz either believes that emotional and psychological factors affect the outcome of surgery or else wants to test that hypothesis, and, third, the med.

we keep on offering the public temporary answers to these things, prescribing (historically) amphetamines, cocaine, opiates, barbiturates and phenothiazines in massive quantities, only to take them away when problems such as addiction ensue.
on the contrary, they are by training and by culture enmeshed in a tradition of rational thought about the obligations and responsibilities of their profession.
a physician engineer can act as consoler; nothing in either logic or social psychology forbids it.
i reject, as i hope i made clear above, the false dichotomy that for each health problem there is either a proven treatment or there is “cam.”
alternatively, if an md called in the witch doctor on his own initiative, that’s more problematic.
i was born in 1942 and have articles from med journals older than i am lying about the safety and efficacy of silver drugs, articles older than i am warning doctors about the fraud and fraudulent ads older than i am.
in his training and skill oz personified the prowess of western medical science; in his experience he understood its limitations.
i do not know if he believes in the nonsense as motz does or if he feels it relieves depression in specific patients and hopes that that will improve their surgical outcomes.
they cut and paste bad study after bad study showing efficacy and tear apart good ones showing none and laugh all the way to the bank which is exactly what they are paid to do, deceive people to make money.
whatever this means, it has nothing to do with any possible practice of medicine, for no one can attend to everything.
although they couldn’t have foreseen thescientific blind spot that would soon hamper academic medicine in the form of “evidence-based medicine,” the authors portend discussions ofprior probability: although it might be interesting to know more about the physiological pathways that are correlated with such processes as the placebo effect, this has nothing do with taking seriously the claims advanced by iridologists or zone therapists or even chiropractors.
controversy or none, the rosenthal center brought a lot of doctors with an interest in unorthodox therapies out of the closet, mehmet oz among them.
am i the only one who sees how almost all mds and educated laypeople would laugh at the first and conclude that the nds were idiots but could possibly be fooled by the second?

despite this, nearly all also use conventional methods, and are satisfied with that.
i have already written in opposition to practitioners pushing “natural remedies”or drugs of whatever ilk.
i see nothing wrong with that, even if the md disbelieves in both shamanism and religion.
in fact, ka elsewhere is arguing the reverse, that while cam may be offering placebo and other non-specific medical benefits these can equally well occur within the 5-15 minute hurly-burly of the typical present day medical practice, i am sure they can, with good doctors, but i would love to be quite sure about the “equally”.
i get the impression you weigh all silly, nonsense equally.
in relation to that we adopt the meanest, least flexible possible position, even while lacking any clear evidence-based handle on the medical or psychosocial benefits or the social functions of unconventional and folk medical activity, or their risks.

i think that one of the down-sides to playing shaman and giving a placebo is that true alternatives such as psychotherapy or a good exercise program are missed and the person then ends up remaining tired and dragged out rather than making the life-style changes that they need or participating in evidence-based cognitive-behavioural therapy.
most of them are vacuous; they are banalities of orthodox medicine, or they have no medical content and no applicability to any possible practice of medicine; they merely sound nice.

the holistic practitioner sees the body in much the same way that magicians of old viewed the universe.

i do agree in the sense that it squanders public money, dupes medical students, perverts the public perception of science and medicine, etc.

be reassured that looking at cam methods in strict cost/risk/benefit terms will definitely not change most of our judgments concerning cam.

the scots are an interesting case study.

i lost all respect for oz when he fell for an old carnival trick and suggested that john of god was doing something to stimulate the pituitary when he stuck forceps up a patient’s nose.
just as it would be problematic to ask a priest to visit a hospital patient who might be jewish (or atheist).
as much as i hate playing the “you’re sick because society made you sick” card, i would never tell someone that they’re sick because they somehow brought it upon themselves.
this view is also context sensitive since considerable scientific evidence suggests the likelihood of symptom relief by the placebo medicines of cam and from interactions with cam practitioners.
that conventional medicine has adequate answers to all health problems and the public should be content with what it offers.
i also only mean products for which they make health claims.
it would be great if that law were repealed, and i’m sure we’d all be for it.
surveys routinely show that the majority of cam-using patients express great satisfaction with them.
on the other hand, being happy is a major component of recovery–i’ve lapsed on my reading on how the nervous system affects the immune system, but as of 2005 (the last year that i followed this closely) the studies seemed to to be pointing towards stress actually lowering immune cell counts and other objective measurements of immune function.
if that is too clumsy, i have no problem with primitive medicine.
the intentions of the seller are irrelevant and often unknowable.
the mere fact that holistic medicine is widespread and enduring is no reason to take its claims seriously; superstition, self-deception, stupidity, and fraud are ubiquitous and always have been.
the reason is that it really doesn’t discriminate if you remember that till not much more than 100 years ago everyone including all the ancestors of everyone living today used primitive or pre-scientific medicine and crude non-standardized remedies, some of which were utterly useless, some dangerous and some just very unreliable.
i got a copy of his book which looks to me like a reputable textbook on colloid chemistry published in 1938.
aromatherapy–okay, smelling nice things does make one happy, but beyond that i don’t think it’s actually effective as medicine.
what i didn’t want to do was offend any devout christians, jews, muslims, or believers of any other religion by seeming to imply that their specific religious beliefs are no more credible than those of a primitive tribesman.
almost all “dietary supplement” marketing claims are woo, in that they are not backed by anything close to reasonable evidence.
medical training is supposed to make physicians good at applying scientific knowledge to sickness, and it is also supposed to make medical doctors good at acquiring through practice an abundance of tacit knowledge useful to their craft.
the second occurred many years later and was heralded not by a conversation, but by a diagnostic test: after a couple of months of excruciating neck pain, i had a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) study that showed that my cervical spine was normal.
they illustrate how there can be a complete disconnection between the benefits of medical interactions and their scientific content, and, indeed.
as oz and others point out, many benefits arise from being able to reduce pain without medication: patients are spared side effects like constipation and stomach bleeding; they feel empowered having participated in their own recovery; they can leave the hospital sooner.
the science seems to be indicating that if we let patients have their way with otherwise harmless things like crystals and incense (obviously not for an asthmatic!)
whatever this means, it has nothing to do with any possible practice of medicine, for no one can attend to everything.
point 3 also brings psychotherapy to mind.
the same shelves boast best-selling books on holistic medicine authored by professors at distinguished medal schools and, in at least one case, by a physician administrator at the national institutes of health.
we may be able to do better with a change of tack if that that might actually be more in touch with medical realities.
if he wants to test the hypothesis that emotional and psychological factors affect the outcome of surgery, then he should test that hypothesis, not bring a ditzy magical thinker into the operating room to violate the privacy of the patient and to distract and embarrass the many other practitioners involved (if i were an anesthesiologist in such a situation, i’d refuse if asked and i’d be livid if i hadn’t been asked).
if physicians cannot distinguish relevant from irrelevant factors, important from unimportant causes, then they can do nothing.
i believe this word was intended to describe a person not educated in ‘western’ science or medicine, and the challenges involved in communicating with such a person might certainly be daunting.
i suspect that if you look at the names of the researchers in most major scientific institutions and journals, you will find that a great many come from non-western cultures.
in last week’s post, i dubbed dr. peter moran the “conscience” of sbm, citing his commitment to doing what’s best for individual patients even if, in theory at least, that may involve some manner of benign but fanciful treatments.
the reason i am being a bit stubborn about these matters is that i have what is as yet merely a vague inkling that they are important — that they may, despite initial appearances, help rather than damage our purposes.
that’s why i write what i write; i, like every other activist, make the contribution that i’m good at making.
the intentions of the seller are irrelevant and often unknowable.
ka rjstan said, “i don’t think he should be asked to do research certainly not on the outcomes of psychological interventions. ”
dr. a, “those in our culture, with occasional exceptions, were not brought up to believe in “cam.”
what i didn’t want to do was offend any devout christians, jews, muslims, or believers of any other religion by seeming to imply that their specific religious beliefs are no more credible than those of a primitive tribesman.
when i tried to file a complaint with the ftc, i said to the lady, “they are quoting old quacks as if they were reputable researchers working today!”
i think that in addition to irrational beliefs there are psychological, emotional and financial reasons why patients and mds resort to unscientific medicine.
everything i hear you and several of your colleagues say sounds like you are horrified by woo and think that cam = woo, that cam is caused by woo and that if only all mds were “critical thinkers” woo would vanish at least from scientific institutions.
moving on to number 2: every pharmacy in europe that advertises “homeopathie” is committing fraud, plain and simple.
in part, this means putting more emphasis on preventive and primary-care medicine.
although they couldn’t have foreseen thescientific blind spot that would soon hamper academic medicine in the form of “evidence-based medicine,” the authors portend discussions ofprior probability: although it might be interesting to know more about the physiological pathways that are correlated with such processes as the placebo effect, this has nothing do with taking seriously the claims advanced by iridologists or zone therapists or even chiropractors.
[...] last week’s post, dr. peter moran answered with more salient points.
my writing is aimed not at every person who dabbles in “supplements,” but at people who should know better, such as some physicians, some medical school deans and other administrators, some scientists at the nih, and some legislators.
i hope we agree that “pleasing customers” isn’t a valid reason for violating medical ethics.
i’m not aware that oz has even “tried” to do any controlled studies to show whether these alleged effects are real.
the standard healthfraud position is that even if cam may sometimes be helpful to people, it is a bad thing regarding which there can be no compromise.
# rjstan@together.net on 01 aug 2008 at 6:55 pm dr. hall, “someone needs to investigate these psychological factors, but a gullible believer in woo like dr. oz is not the one to do it.”
he’d contact a site, they’d remove the reference and two more sites would pop up using it.
those in our culture, with occasional exceptions, were not brought up to believe in “cam.”
we scientists are ever-so cautious when making scientific judgments about complex matters; let’s not pretend that arriving at absolutes in medical ethics is a piece of cake, especially when it is not quite clear how anything done with the undiluted welfare of the individual patient in mind can be entirely unethical.
depending on the condition, and with as much reluctance and regret as anyone here, my money would be on the practitioner who is not hamstrung by what science says, and in consequence has a confident explanation for everything and never runs out of remedies.
but healthfraud has to also deal with what a lot of other practitioners think and what our patients are often trying out on their own initiative.
they cut and paste bad study after bad study showing efficacy and tear apart good ones showing none and laugh all the way to the bank which is exactly what they are paid to do, deceive people to make money.
he made motz part of his team and allowed her to introduce a macrobiotic diet, acupuncture, hypnosis, aromatherapy, changing light from fluorescent to incandescent, and cleaning the floors only with natural cleansers.

as magicians, they possess magical powers either because of the occult knowledge they possess or simply because of who they are—for example, because they stand in some special relation to gods or demons.
is it right to then turn around and say, well you didn’t really need these things anyway, even denying them any relief that they may derive from “pretend medicines”.
as you point out, you wouldn’t call in a priest to minister to a jewish patient or an atheist, nor would you call in a rabbi to minister to a catholic.
they’ll tend to be more knowledgable on average than the tribesman, but it’s a difference of degree, not kind.
sure, on its face it makes sense to use something that works without regard to why it works, but that’s a deceptive way to look at what oz, an enthusiastic big kid with a solid background in cardiac surgery but none in critical thinking, is doing: “return[ing] the practice of medicine to the practice of magic and…replac[ing] logic and method with occultism and obfuscation.”
another is that they are magicians who exercise occult powers to bring about healing.
it is like stores that sell cigarettes.
if the tribesman wants it, and if the md judges that it’s safe and won’t interfere with the ‘real’ treatments, it’s pretty much analogous to a patient who wants to take homeopathy in addition to his ‘real’ medicines.
i don’t think you understand where these people are coming from or speak their language.
you said, “if he wants to test the hypothesis that emotional and psychological factors affect the outcome of surgery, then he should test that hypothesis, not bring a ditzy magical thinker into the operating room
he could sew bypass grafts and implant new hearts, but he was hard pressed to change the habits that put his patients on the operating table or to grapple with the emotional and psychological factors that might hasten their healing.
they know what we mean when we write “woo,” and they ought to feel the sting of the insult.
the answer to point 3 is the same as the answer to point 2, and i certainly don’t mind if “people feel better for taking a multivitamin or an innocuous herb” (if that were the extent of “cam” we’d hardly be wasting our time here).
of course i agree that “pleasing customers” is not a reason to deceive patients.
they probably realize it already, and that’s just not going to help.
on the contrary, they are by training and by culture enmeshed in a tradition of rational thought about the obligations and responsibilities of their profession.
i have to wonder if: “introduc[ing] a macrobiotic diet, acupuncture, hypnosis, aromatherapy, channging light from fluorescent to incandescent, and cleaning the floors of with only natural cleansers” is that bad.
all the doctors i know would be prepared to call in the witch-doctor if it would help assuage the fears, or help in the management, of a seriously ill primitive tribesman.
my objection is to lying to the patient, implying that a treatment is supported by evidence when it really isn’t.
in relation to that we adopt the meanest, least flexible possible position, even while lacking any clear evidence-based handle on the medical or psychosocial benefits or the social functions of unconventional and folk medical activity, or their risks.
if you limit your exposes to irrational beliefs you will have a much narrower audience and much smaller impact than if you expose fraud.
perhaps you noticed that a few weeks ago i cited the naturopath’s bible, the textbook of natural medicine (2nd edition, pizzorno and murray eds, edinburgh, churchill livingstone, 1999) for having plugged colloidal silver, administered orally, as a treatment for opportunistic infections in hiv+ patients (p. 1292).
i will not pull files.
in part, this means putting more emphasis on preventive and primary-care medicine.
the principles governing scientific reasoning and belief are negative as well as positive, and they imply that occult doctrines are not worthy of belief.
the book “hands of life” describes how intuitive energy healer julie motz was accepted into dr. oz’s operating rooms as part of his cardiac surgery team.
it need not be introduced in an unjustified or insulting way, i.e., by implying that the patient’s symptoms are “all in her head” or are “functional” or whatever.
they include fraud, ignorance and desperation as well as a love and belief in magic and an inability to face reality.
“such candor serves to maintain my view of him as our “conscience,” even as it makes me optimistic that we might dissuade him from making those positions permanent.
what bothers me is the fraud used to sell it and i think that focusing on that we can help a lot of people.
sure, they have money, but so does “big tobacco.”
i do not write about religious beliefs, for example.
but surely you can understand how emotionally comforting it must be for people, especially terminally ill people and their loved ones, to believe they are going to “heaven” forever.
the “general public” is not synonymous with “patients,” even if the latter are drawn from the former, but even if patients are victimized by themselves, it’s still up to an ethical physician to point that out.
if homeo “remedies” are traditional there, i assume the public knows the theory behind them.
if congress is actually successful in giving the fda the power to regulate tobacco(a terrible idea, in my opinion, but for reasons that have nothing to do with this discussion), “supplement” companies and advocates won’t have a leg to stand on.
the ethical card has some force, even when set against other primary ethical obligations of doctors towards their patients, but in reality it can only apply to that select few who have a clear enough grasp of the scientific evidence to be as certain as can be that any given cam treatment is a placebo.
if physicians were more attentive to science and ethics and to explaining things to patients, politicians, and the media, more people would know that.
i simply can’t believe all that is in the patients’ best interests.
medical training is supposed to make physicians good at applying scientific knowledge to sickness, and it is also supposed to make medical doctors good at acquiring through practice an abundance of tacit knowledge useful to their craft.
if the tribesman wants it, and if the md judges that it’s safe and won’t interfere with the ‘real’ treatments, it’s pretty much analogous to a patient who wants to take homeopathy in addition to his ‘real’ medicines.
one of the larger books of this kind was even subsidized by the national institute of mental health.
oz brought “healers” who use a “therapy” similar to tt into the operating room to “treat” his patient during surgery.
one hopes they will speak bluntly, but it does no good to join forces with cranks and quacks, magicians and madmen.
that recommendation is woo, and its fulfillment would be fraud.
that “alternative” methods do nothing worthwhile for those using them, anyway.
dr. a, “there are plenty of modern physicians whose patients are not disposed to look elsewhere” if that were true, there wouldn’t be a billion $$ supplement industry.
at columbia-presbyterian the presence of hands-on healers in an operating room is only the most dramatic example of a new willingness to venture into the terra incognita of healing.
perhaps in the rarifed air of aristotlian (sp?) logic one cannot conclude that that means that they are taking advise about medicine from people other than their physicians and leaving out their mds, but i think that if anyone did a serious study, they would find that that is exactly what it indicates.
she tells them they are bringing treatments such as surgery into their lives in order to relive their traumas, including prenatal traumas.
they include fraud, ignorance and desperation as well as a love and belief in magic and an inability to face reality.
moreover, physician engineers have no immunity to moral or ethical constraints.
to violate the privacy of the patient…” first, if the article reported correctly, the patient was very pleased with the “ditzy magical thinker”.
and please remember that many victims of quackery were not injured by bad practitioners of scientific medicine.
# pmoran on 02 aug 2008 at 7:19 pm “such candor serves to maintain my view of him as our “conscience,” even as it makes me optimistic that we might dissuade him from making those positions permanent.
patients are not the problem; they are, if you’ll excuse the drama, the victims.
dr. a, “there are plenty of modern physicians whose patients are not disposed to look elsewhere” if that were true, there wouldn’t be a billion $$ supplement industry.
dr. b. he is a reputable silver researcher horrified by the way silver quacks cite his work to promote supplements.
finally, i’d argue that in neither case should an md actively solicit interventions that he knows to be useless, whether they be a witch doctor’s potions or homeopathic remedies.
perhaps you noticed that a few weeks ago i cited the naturopath’s bible, the textbook of natural medicine (2nd edition, pizzorno and murray eds, edinburgh, churchill livingstone, 1999) for having plugged colloidal silver, administered orally, as a treatment for opportunistic infections in hiv+ patients (p. 1292).
even seemingly benign practices, if implausible, can be harmful (“first, do no harm”), particularly when promoted by someone who should know better.
the alternatives to homeopathy for minor or self-limiting complaints, moreover, need not be “nsaids or antibiotics or antidepressants” unless there is a good reason for one of them.
no, but a huge % of those in our culture, perhaps the majority, were brought up to believe in nonsense.
they are only committing fraud if they tell people that there is evidence that homeo “remedies” work or that they contain active ingredients.
dr. a, “every pharmacy in europe that advertises “homeopathie” is committing fraud, plain and simple.”
when discussing quackery, i hate the skeptic’s use of the word woo because i think that the people you should be trying to reach don’t understand it and when they do they will think you are talking down your noses at them.
i countered with my own opinion that honesty and integrity are necessary parts of any discussion with a patient, and that they, in turn, must not conflict with science and reason.
because of such notions, …holistic practitioners…are under no obligation, they believe, to reconcile their claims about therapy with what is known about the causal pathways of the body.
however, many shamanistic cultures have incredibly complex social networks and family structures (for example) that are by no means ‘primitive’.
all the doctors i know would be prepared to call in the witch-doctor if it would help assuage the fears, or help in the management, of a seriously ill primitive tribesman.
i use honey instead of neosporin on my cuts, and eat a largely vegetarian diet–not because i think it’s healthier (which i do), but because i just happen to not like the taste of meat.
# kimball atwood on 02 aug 2008 at 9:12 pm rosemary, here are more responses: all i’m trying to do is point out that the picture is much bigger than “woo” and that the danger of snake oil is far greater than accepting irrational beliefs.
what i’m trying unsuccessfully to bring out is that i feel completely disconnected with the majority of you because of your tone.
but surely you can understand how emotionally comforting it must be for people, especially terminally ill people and their loved ones, to believe they are going to “heaven” forever.
take my word for it that every pharmacy in europe displays “homeopathie” (or language equivalents) in large letters outside.
when i heard that silver was being sold as a supplement, i asked the salesmen how they knew it was safe and effective.
on 10 nov 2008 at 2:00 pm [...] a great job examining the ethical implications of certain alternative medicine practices, and has a terrific dialog with peter moran, a frequent commenter here.
but healthfraud has to also deal with what a lot of other practitioners think and what our patients are often trying out on their own initiative.
the claim to diagnose by examining the eye or to cure by massaging the foot is completely bogus; we know more than enough about the workings of the body to be reasonably certain that geometric features of the iris, for instance, do not provide the specific information about disorders that iridologists claim they do….of course, it is conceivable that the beliefs of scientific medicine are in error about one or another of these matters, but that is no reason for using public funds to investigate holistic claims.
it is they who have embarrassed science and medicine, and who have violated the public trust.
patients who suffer from coronary heart disease may be treated with beta blockers and antiplatelet drugs, and they may also be advised to change their work, their diet, their smoking habits, their exercise habits, and their living conditions.
by not addressing that, you argue, we sbmers don’t have a chance to make much difference.
dr. a, “by your own description, there was no “dietary supplement industry” as it now exists when your doctor treated you with silver.
i am talking about feelings and perceptions here, things i get the impression skeptics have difficulty dealing with, things i think have to be used to communicate with the general public.
[pelletier 1977]“ and that “the entire body (and psyche) can be treated or diagnosed through the treatment or observations of a special part of the anatomy.”
they are only committing fraud if they tell people that there is evidence that homeo “remedies” work or that they contain active ingredients.
oz brought “healers” who use a “therapy” similar to tt into the operating room to “treat” his patient during surgery.
we expect skilled engineers to be able to learn from experience and to get better at building bridges, because we believe that their training has subjected them to a rational discipline that has made them good learners about such matters.
dr. a, “every pharmacy in europe that advertises “homeopathie” is committing fraud, plain and simple.
the difference between us is that i insist that medicine is about an infinite number of individual contexts and i see many examples where ethical absolutes (actually these are ethical guidelines rather than directives) do not apply or don’t seem to apply very well.
many patients, perhaps most, expect honesty and integrity, and have a pretty good sense of when they see it and when they don’t.
if that is too clumsy, i have no problem with primitive medicine.
at times, physicians may find themselves in sympathy with the holistic movement, because some fragment of the rhetoric rings true, because of certain practices and attitudes they encounter in their daily work with colleagues and patients, or because of dissatisfaction with the economic and social organization of medicine.

i was born in 1942 and have articles from med journals older than i am lying about the safety and efficacy of silver drugs, articles older than i am warning doctors about the fraud and fraudulent ads older than i am.
i think that it is the general public that has gotten politicians, doctors and scientific institutions to offer cam and that it was the marketers in the dietary supplement industry that got the public to do that.
far more people are concerned about and can recognize fraud than irrational beliefs.
the subjects are people rather than bridges, but in many respects the professions of medicine and engineering are alike.
and i think that focusing on that we can help a lot of people.
there were ads that made it look as if he were alive and well and working today.
they had a column in jama reporting their investigations and warned about henry and his buddies and their articles several times.
if a surgeon doing a high risk operation suspects that having a wacky woman wave her hands over the patient during the proceedure will calm the patient and seriously decrease the amount of depression she experiences afterwards, something he suspects will improve her chances of a good outcome, and invites the wacky woman to proceed, is that very different than a doctor at his wits end with a seriously ill person trying something he believes can’t possibly help, but using it because he has heard stories that it does?
my point about the failure of psychotherapy is that human beings have emotional and psychological needs that aren’t being met in today’s society although i don’t really know that they were ever met and i certainly don’t think that we should expect medicine to meet those needs, but i do think we should expect practitioners of scientific medicine to realize that humans have emotional and psychological needs, many of which are not being met.
if the claim were valid, holistic practice would have to constitute a scientific tradition, albeit one in competition with the tradition of orthodox medicine.
the science seems to be indicating that if we let patients have their way with otherwise harmless things like crystals and incense (obviously not for an asthmatic!)
the alternatives to homeopathy for minor or self-limiting complaints, moreover, need not be “nsaids or antibiotics or antidepressants” unless there is a good reason for one of them.
those who we might wish to influence in various ways may not have sufficient familiarity with science and medicine to be able to articulate the line of argument i am developing (it is difficult enough for me and i know i have a long haul ahead of me even if i am entirely right), but one of the reasons for our distressing inability to have the influence we desire may well be that people of ordinary intelligence and experience can nevertheless almost instinctively sense the weaknesses and exaggerations in some of our habitual arguments.
if they feel talked down to (assuming any of them even reads this stuff), that’s fine with me.
i am not prepared to go that far, although i think i understand why some doctors might do that.
depression, for instance, has emerged as one of the major risk factors in the recovery of heart patients after surgery.

we definitely do not yet have entirely safe and 100% effective solutions to all of mankind’s ills, and certain imperfections of everyday medical practice can heighten the risks of the use of unnecessarily powerful pharmaceuticals.
their newfoundendorsement by governmental edict is no more justified than would be a similar endorsement of tribal witch doctors.
the subjects are people rather than bridges, but in many respects the professions of medicine and engineering are alike.
if you think cam is only about woo, imo you are very wrong, and you won’t be able to do a lot to combat quackery and snake oil because very few people besides skeptics will listen to you.
they had a column in jama reporting their investigations and warned about henry and his buddies and their articles several times.
i am not prepared to go that far, although i think i understand why some doctors might do that.
that is deceptive and since there is not a tradition of use here, i doubt that many in the general public would buy them if they knew the truth about them.
many quacks are themselves physicians with no acceptable excuse, who until recently were kept in check by strong professional and governmental pressures, only to have found themselves reborn in a new “ golden age of quackery.”
we don’t care that they may be being used mainly when there is no entirely satisfactory evidence-based treatments for the complaint, nor that some of the methods may simply have not yet been subjected to sufficient study to be quite sure whether they have intrinsic medical activity or not.
i remained an adolescent for some time, but i sure felt a hell of a lot better.
the ethical card has some force, even when set against other primary ethical obligations of doctors towards their patients, but in reality it can only apply to that select few who have a clear enough grasp of the scientific evidence to be as certain as can be that any given cam treatment is a placebo.
the rest of the stuff (the psychobabble) is pure crap.
just as it would be problematic to ask a priest to visit a hospital patient who might be jewish (or atheist).
although the physician’s medical practice is not itself science, it is based on science and on training that is supposed to teach physicians to apply scientific knowledge to people in a rational way.
aromatherapy–okay, smelling nice things does make one happy, but beyond that i don’t think it’s actually effective as medicine.
pharmacies selling cigarettes perhaps should be embarrassing to pharmacists, but at least every customer knows what they are.
as far as i’m concerned people and doctors can do what they want to themselves and consenting adults but they have to be honest about it.
they illustrate how there can be a complete disconnection between the benefits of medical interactions and their scientific content, and, indeed.
and i think that focusing on that we can help a lot of people.
we definitely do not yet have entirely safe and 100% effective solutions to all of mankind’s ills, and certain imperfections of everyday medical practice can heighten the risks of the use of unnecessarily powerful pharmaceuticals.
i do agree in the sense that it squanders public money, dupes medical students, perverts the public perception of science and medicine, etc.
the key is that the patient has to request it and be of the same faith.
but contrary to my initial impression, i don’t think the witch doctor example reveals anything new.
because many patients become the victims of quackery does not negate the fact that the epidemic of cam we are now experiencing started with the general public and worked its way up to scientific institutions.
as oz and others point out, many benefits arise from being able to reduce pain without medication: patients are spared side effects like constipation and stomach bleeding; they feel empowered having participated in their own recovery; they can leave the hospital sooner.
i’m not aware that oz has even “tried” to do any controlled studies to show whether these alleged effects are real.
they are, mostly, the herbal medications and dietary recommendations that i’ve tried on myself and found effective, as well as yoga.
those who we might wish to influence in various ways may not have sufficient familiarity with science and medicine to be able to articulate the line of argument i am developing (it is difficult enough for me and i know i have a long haul ahead of me even if i am entirely right), but one of the reasons for our distressing inability to have the influence we desire may well be
in julie motz’s book she says oz credited her with the success when a transplanted heart started beating, saying he didn’t know what she did in there, but he’d never seen a heart come back so fast.
another is that they are magicians who exercise occult powers to bring about healing.
the [...] # durvit on 26 aug 2008 at 10:24 am holistic medicine is a pablum of common sense and nonsense offered by cranks and quacks and failed pedants who share an attachment to magic and an animosity toward reason.
i am a strong believer in evidence based medicine and i have great respect for the authors on this site for their incredible knowledge, intelligence, talent and high ethical standards, but i think there is a very nasty epidemic out there called cam affecting the majority of people in many industrialized countries.

we may be able to do better with a change of tack if that that might actually be more in touch with medical realities.
