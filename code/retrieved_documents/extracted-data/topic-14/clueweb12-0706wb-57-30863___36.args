i've come to believe that most people are blissfully unaffected by reason and that beneath all the rhetoric, we as humans tend to follow the biases in which we've been indoctrinated as children.
without a firm foundation in the philosophies of each tradition, "integration" can be a recipe for confusion.
#2-4 are merely ways of wording the "intuitions" that western herbalists may have, or the conscious analyses that tcm herbalists conclude, in order to define the mathematics necessary for a computer to understand.

i have six friends who have survived cancer, all more than 20 years, and by exclusively using "alternative" services of several mexican cancer clinics.
they can be used just as readily to describe the effects of radiation damage, purified hormones, and many chemical pollutants, even though these did not exist before the 20th century.
it will never replace the traditional information, as any medical practice is always based on the symptoms and observable clinical signs at the first level of analysis, and i feel that tcm does this first level best.
the u.s. naturopathic profession and its allies are invaluable sources of this type of information.
sorry, but while intuition is a fine thing, one cannot program a computer solely with intuition and, moreover, one cannot teach effectively.
there are numerous herbs with broad-spectrum antibacterial and antiviral activity; much more important to consider are matching the herbal formula to the stage of the fever, degree of thirst and dehydration, presence or absence of delirium, rashes, hemorrhaging, excessive perspiration, etc.
pasteur himself stated before his death that he regretted that medical doctors and researchers had become so obsessed with microbial causes, as he realized that infectious illnesses resulted from a complex interaction among various factors, including the condition of the individual, the microbial flora, and environment.
if i've made an error in my synthesis, then perhaps people in future generations can study the archives of the cultural anthropologists, then reassess my conclusions and attempt to patch them up.
(i've never been much impressed by traditional chinese music.)
it is defined most accurately by the consequences of its absence or deficiency: fatigue, pallor, weak and quiet voice, soft-weak pulse, pale-tender tongue, and possibly organ prolapse, spontaneous perspiration, proneness to bruising and bleeding disorders.
tcm, on the other hand, strikes a balance between detail and conceptual elegance that facilitates constructing mathematical schema, and thus might fulfil the role of the "pre-processor" stage that the mit researchers predicted would be necessary for more accurate computer-aided medical diagnosis.
i know quite a few people who were diagnosed with aids and/or were hiv+ and have survived more than 20 years without doing any toxic drugs, only diet and lifestyle changes plus herbal formulas occasionally.
i have never encountered anything in western herbology, ayurveda, or any other herbal tradition, that even approaches this level of detail.
fortunately, the tcm materia medica includes some of the very same species that are used as herbs in america and europe.
without careful thought, the internal logical consistency of these traditions may be sacrificed for the appearance of eclectic wisdom, and the resulting bastardization of terminology may only confuse.
read focus on the theory of the three doshas (vatta, pita, kapha), but don't go much beyond this level.
on the other hand, integration without violating the internal logical consistencies of each tradition can often lead to great insight.
western herbalists tend to emphasize the botanical aspects of herbal practice more than most tcm herbalists, many of whom do not even know the botanical species name of the herbs they use.
interestingly, during the 1990's several mit artificial intelligence researchers stated that expert systems for medical diagnosis had repeatedly encountered a seemingly insurmountable bottleneck: while individual medical disease entities have specific criteria for their diagnosis, the actual clinical reality is far more ambiguous, for there are many combinations of symptoms and clinical signs that fail to yield a clear diagnosis.[a1] effectively, they were admitting that medical diagnosis, in spite of and even because of its complexity, fails to fulfil the equivalent of criteria #1 above the state-space defined by conventional medical diagnosis is not only filled with holes, but with vast regions that are either not defined or poorly defined.
tcm, on the other hand, strikes a balance between detail and conceptual elegance that facilitates constructing mathematical schema, and thus might fulfil the role of the "pre-processor" stage that the mit researchers predicted would be necessary for more accurate computer-aided medical diagnosis.
if two different systems reputedly deal with the same problem space (in our case, health and disease), i'll try to figure out which one does the best job and then simply not waste any more time on the inferior system, with the following exception: if there are ideas or insights in the inferior system that are not replicated in the other, i'll try to integrate these, and only these, into the better system.
they do not work for the average american student; only the very best survive this nonsense.
since childhood i've been programming computers for entertainment, to carry out professional projects, and for the last 10 years, as part of a long-term project to develop databases and expert systems software for tcm clinical assessment and problem solving.
however, the majority of this research indicates that of all the world's music, european classical music (mozart, haydn, bach, beethoven) has by far the most generally beneficial effects.
one individual went from having a 105 deg.
one can speculate as to all the physiological phenomena that might result in this pattern, such as insufficient thyroid hormone.
after flailing about for a while, i began reading several textbooks of chinese herbology recommended by an acupuncturist friend.
but thyroid hormone isnot qi, nor are nerve action potentials, nor anything else, though these things might be correlated with qi to varying degrees.
my own supplier take these matters seriously, as well as testing imported lots for heavy metals and pesticide levels, but until recently this has been the exception rather than the rule for chinese herb companies and distributors.
see: see chapters 1-3 of traditional chinese herbal sciences, volume 1; in: herbalthink-tcm software the state-space described in #1 allows for one to devise a measurement criteria, just as with any orthogonal measurement system, that allows one to quantitatively measure the similarity or disparity between two clinical patterns.
this is western medical thinking and simply does not work that well.
it's very difficult to define a unique and independent american cuisine; our foods have originated from a polyglot of cultures - american indian, italian, french, german, african, chinese, etc.
here's a short checklist of the results of my own synthesis, which has evolved from a combination of trial and error, much reading, and clinical results, the final and ultimate test: a number of herbalists have commented on the problems of studying ancient masters whose writings seem only barely relevant to current human conditions.
f. fever with early-stage acute renal failure to an almost normal temperature with regained kidney function within 6 hours of drinking a large dose of herbal tea, and was discharged from hospital as they needed the beds for other similar cases.
the optimal synthesis of traditional chinese herbology with western medicine and science entails using traditional chinese methods for describing whole-body patterns of symptoms and clinical signs and to incorporate knowledge from modern nutrition, biochemistry, pharmacology, microbiology, and pathology as means offine-tuning the choice of herbs, formulas, dietary recommendations, and other therapies.
the teaching methodologies of tcm are in the dark ages of rote memorization.
it is evident from their writings that some of these herbalists have borrowed significantly from chinese herbology and ayurveda.
while i am aware that chinese texts talk about "causes", these are usually not causes in the western scientific sense of materialistic causation.
like a lot of herbalists, i began exploring herbs because of personal health needs.
(although computers are free from ethnic biases, they require their instructions to be quite explicit so as not to become confused, much like beginning students of herbology.)
it is a tedious distraction to search out momordica fruits to tonify one's lung yin, when the deficiency of lung yin might be caused by the lack of a humidifier in a forced-air heating system or an improperly vented exhaust outlet.

let the cultural anthropologists write esoteric papers on the detritus; these folks do serve a valuable function as archivists of ancient knowledge.
the primary flaw of western medicine is that is has become so obsessed with materialistic chains of causality that it often ignores the systemic whole-body patterns that are screaming for attention.
i have never encountered anything in western herbology, ayurveda, or any other herbal tradition, that even approaches this level of detail.
while this may be useful, i do not consider it "cutting edge" knowledge, especially in light of recent studies documenting the ineffectiveness of most chemotherapy and radiation treatments for cancer.
like a lot of herbalists, i began exploring herbs because of personal health needs.
their conclusion was that a pre-processor stage would be required that parsed the data of clinical symptoms and signs into a more fundamental state-space of variables, which could in turn provide the framework for more accurate conventional medical diagnosis.
consequently, some herbalists have developed their own idiosyncratic systems.
as traditional chinese herbology is a descriptive, phenomenological system, its insights remain valid regardless of advances in scientific materialism (materialistic causality).
for example, the traditional chinese term "deficiency of yin" has no simple corresponding equivalent in western medicine.
the reason that #2-4 above are important is that without these being implicit in one's paradigm, one cannot say to a student, "your herbal formula is way off base for this client, it will result in either death or severe side effects."
tcm says almost nothing about this subject - i've asked many of my colleagues, so it's either well hidden or nonexistent knowledge.
one cannot simply mix together, simmer, and stir a bit, hoping that the resulting concoction will be either pleasing or useful.
perhaps some mathematician-homeopath might attempt it, but it would seem to me a gargantuan task.
this could give western herbalists a head start in figuring out how to use these herbs in a more precisely targeted manner.
as traditional chinese herbology has become popularized worldwide, the dominant culture of scientific materialism applies political and economic coercion to "biomedicalize" and "scientize" it, to make it more amenable to profit-making schemes.
the rules of tcm assessment are defined with a sufficient level of detail that the following computational criteria can be fulfilled: the reason that #2-4 above are important is that without these being implicit in one's paradigm, one cannot say to a student, "your herbal formula is way off base for this client, it will result in either death or severe side effects."
in all these cases the herbal formulas were only slightly modified from the standard tcm formulas for ying- and xue-stage virulent heat (wen bing) patterns.
i've used this information in simple diet and cooking classes for clients.
i've come to believe that most people are blissfully unaffected by reason and that beneath all the rhetoric, we as humans tend to follow the biases in which we've been indoctrinated as children.
if i've made an error in my synthesis, then perhaps people in future generations can study the archives of the cultural anthropologists, then reassess my conclusions and attempt to patch them up.
or "your herbal formula is close, but it might be even better with a bit of x thrown in."
in a way, it is much like statistics, describing the correlations among symptoms and clusters of symptoms and how these clusters or patterns are likely to evolve and transform into other patterns.
this is western medical thinking and simply does not work that well.
tcm should acknowledge its debt to ayurveda, as historically, ayurveda was transmitted along with buddhism via tibet and then into china.

criterion #2 then allows us to create a corresponding state-space for herbal properties (a simplified example: heating/cooling, drying/moistening, etc.) that complements the state-space of patterns.
i've been involved as a consultant in several cases of hemorrhagic fevers for which the doctors in the hospital had essentially pronounced that they had tried everything in their arsenal, the patient would soon be dead, and they gave their blessing to try herbs as a last resort.
sorry, but while intuition is a fine thing, one cannot program a computer solely with intuition and, moreover, one cannot teach effectively.
one cannot simply mix together, simmer, and stir a bit, hoping that the resulting concoction will be either pleasing or useful.
however, what i like about the tcm assessment system is that it provides an accurate, computer-reproducible, rule-based system for describing and analyzing patterns of symptoms — these basic patterns of the body's reponses are almost universal in scope.
it is evident from their writings that some of these herbalists have borrowed significantly from chinese herbology and ayurveda.
for example, all one's knowledge of hormone physiology becomes a theoretical castle in the sky if one cannot measure the levels.
i do know from studying the homeopathic materia medica, that many remedies have listed so many symptoms that it seems difficult to make sense of the priorities; i would assume that this comes with experience.
as such, i'm firmly entrenched in the traditional american pattern of borrowing ideas from other cultures when they are useful.
the traditional chinese literature (the shang han lun and wen bing) nicely complements modern microbiological understanding of infectious illness, but to debate over causes can become a war of words.
for example "aids", "fibromyalgia", "autoimmune disorders", "hepatitis" are not precisely targeted diagnostic terms; one cannot design an herbal formula "for aids", "for autoimmune disorders", or for most other medically defined conditions without knowing the specific symptom-sign pattern or patterns involved in a specific case.
here again, it is crucial to match the herbal formula to the pattern of presenting symptoms.
i once took a short course in ayurvedic cooking; i've never tasted such delicious food that also felt healthy afterward.
that various ingested substances, as they become digested and metabolized, will affect tissues they contact differently.
without careful thought, the internal logical consistency of these traditions may be sacrificed for the appearance of eclectic wisdom, and the resulting bastardization of terminology may only confuse.
traditional chinese herbology, ayurveda, western herbology, and allopathic medicine are each characterized by sets of terminology and rules of logical deduction for which one-to-one correspondences are not easily described.
i advocate that new students new to tcm, especially medical doctors and nurses,temporarily set aside their medical way of thinking while learning tcm theory and assessment.
tcm should acknowledge its debt to ayurveda, as historically, ayurveda was transmitted along with buddhism via tibet and then into china.
on the other hand, integration without violating the internal logical consistencies of each tradition can often lead to great insight.
it is also evident that a growing portion of western herbalists have become receptive to chinese herbology as they recognize it has the potential to fill in a major gap in their own techniques — mainly in clinical assessment.
that is not necessarily a disadvantage, and as i discuss in my textbooks, it is often a distraction to interpose a theorized physical basis for causation when the real goal in clinical practice is to match an effective herbal formula with the totality of the symptom-sign pattern so as to relieve it, whatever the "cause" or "causes".
perhaps some mathematician-homeopath might attempt it, but it would seem to me a gargantuan task.

there is a vast amount of research proving beyond any doubt that music has powerful and often rapid effects on measurable physiological parameters, both positive and negative: eeg patterns, hormone levels, heart rate, even the growth pattern of neurons and dendritic branching patterns in the brain.
ayurvedic cooking proves this idea wrong, and i use the properties of the basic tastes to explain how to put together a meal that is balanced for a given individual and that also tastes good.
i was instantly impressed by the level of detail in the assessment system.

updated 2006-03-15 by roger w. wicke, ph.d. it is not always clear how to integrate knowledge from disparate health traditions.
the basic patterns in tcm are quite adequate for describing these problems in sufficient detail to point one toward appropriate herbal formulas and dietary regimes, with a few exceptions, such as autoimmune conditions associated with heavy metal toxicity.
all the ayurvedic courses and texts i have read focus on the theory of the three doshas (vatta, pita, kapha), but don't go much beyond this level.

tcm is a concise and detailed phenomenological system of correspondences, not an exposition of "causes" in the western sense of scientific materialism; its primary objective is to match up descriptions of whole-body patterns of easily recognized symptoms and clinical signs (tongue, pulse, body appearance) with herbs and herbal formulas historically observed to be effective for specific whole-body patterns.
although limited in scope, what it set out to do, it does well.
or "your herbal formula is close, but it might be even better with a bit of x thrown in."
for example, microwave ovens, synthetic sweeteners, genetically modified foods, and margarine did not exist until the late 20th century; we cannot expect much wisdom from the ancient masters in addressing problems in modern nutrition and environmental toxicity.
here's a short checklist of the results of my own synthesis, which has evolved from a combination of trial and error, much reading, and clinical results, the final and ultimate test: of all the various herbal traditions i've studied, i've spent by far the most time on tcm because it has the best assessment techniques to offer the low-tech herbalist.
the phytochemical and pharmacological data coming out within the past 20 years or so on herbs, including chinese herbs, is useful supplementary information.
tcm assessment methods have some potentially interesting applications, such as helping to understand the health effects of music and sound.
as traditional chinese herbology has become popularized worldwide, the dominant culture of scientific materialism applies political and economic coercion to "biomedicalize" and "scientize" it, to make it more amenable to profit-making schemes.
qi is not a physical substance; even the word "energy" is a crude and misleading translation.
in this aspect, many western herbal teachers are already doing a lot of things right: taste-testing the herbs in one's materia medica, keeping journals of one's subjective experiences, discussing case studies as a way to illustrate techniques and improve clinical skills.
first, we should ask what we wish to achieve by a synthesis of the chinese herbal tradition with western systems of medicine and herbology.
in all these cases the herbal formulas were only slightly modified from the standard tcm formulas for ying- and xue-stage virulent heat (wen bing) patterns.
on the other hand, western physicians and naturopaths have made major breakthroughs in this area within the past decade,
finally, to dispel the notion that only "chinese" herbs must be used within the tcm assessment paradigm: one can use any herb or food as long as one can describe it in terms of criterion #3.
qi is not a physical substance; even the word "energy" is a crude and misleading translation.
it's very difficult to define a unique and independent american cuisine; our foods have originated from a polyglot of cultures - american indian, italian, french, german, african, chinese, etc.
i find it amusing when some scientist speculates on what qi might look like under the microscope or how it could be detected.
phenomenological vs. causal reasoning tcm is a concise and detailed phenomenological system of correspondences, not an exposition of "causes" in the western sense of scientific materialism; its primary objective is to match up descriptions of whole-body patterns of easily recognized symptoms and clinical signs (tongue, pulse, body appearance) with herbs and herbal formulas historically observed to be effective for specific whole-body patterns.
while i know of some western herbalists who, after years of study and experience, have developed their own effective methods, the lack of a coherent and systematic approach makes their insights difficult to communicate to the next generation.
on the merits of ayurveda vs. tcm although ayurveda has useful insights to offer, its system of assessment if far less sophisticated; this becomes evident when comparing textbooks on tcm assessment (with typically around 120-140 distinct patterns defined and discussed) with those of ayurveda.
the cases of aids i've seen were all over the map as far as tcm patterns and formulas that were given.
if one cannot do expensive tests, then one has to rely on one's basics senses and the symptom perceptions of the client.
in my opinion there is no such thing as a single herbal formula appropriate "for aids".
they can be used just as readily to describe the effects of radiation damage, purified hormones, and many chemical pollutants, even though these did not exist before the 20th century.
i once took a short course in ayurvedic cooking; i've never tasted such delicious food that also felt healthy afterward.
also the idea that each taste may have differing predigestive, digestive, and postdigestive effects is consistent with the observation that various ingested substances, as they become digested and metabolized, will affect tissues they contact differently.
it is my own conclusion that tcm theory already provides the basis for the "preprocessor" stage that the mit researchers claim is necessary to improve the performance of expert systems in medical diagnostics.
the chinese were fortunate that their herbalist-scholars recorded the rules of their paradigm in detail, so that each future generation would not have to tediously rediscover these basic insights, and, instead, could continually refine them.
i find it amusing when some scientist speculates on what qi might look like under the microscope or how it could be detected.
so although hype and disinformation on reputed cancer remedies may abound, some of the information coming from american and european clinics on how to deal with cancer is far ahead of anything i've read from china.
i assure them than after they have learned the patterns thoroughly, they will find that their medical knowledge regains its usefulness as a way tofine-tune the basic tcm assessment in given case, but to prematurely attempt integrating would only lead to confusion.

since childhood i've been programming computers for entertainment, to carry out professional projects, and for the last 10 years, as part of a long-term project to develop databases and expert systems software for tcm clinical assessment and problem solving.
i took the opportunity to question him on his opinion of the current state of the art in chemotherapy and radiation — his reply was that the vast majority of it was useless garbage (the possible exceptions being certain drugs for childhood leukemia), not only ineffective, but likely speeding up patients' demise.
i know quite a few people who were diagnosed with aids and/or were hiv+ and have survived more than 20 years without doing any toxic drugs, only diet and lifestyle changes plus herbal formulas occasionally.

while tcm doctors give lip service to the idea of good diet, ayurvedic doctors place much greater emphasis on diet, and this aspect is certainly important in dealing with american clients whose diets are typically disastrous.
without a firm foundation in the philosophies of each tradition, "integration" can be a recipe for confusion.
though hemorrhagic fevers are generally rare, i suspect we will be seeing more of these, and we may not have to wait long if the h5n1 virus in se asia becomes a worldwide pandemic.
so in the realm of music therapy, i've used ideas from tcm assessment theory to evaluate and predict each individual's unique response to a piece of music, but i've chosen to focus on the classical european repertoire.
however, western scientific knowledge of herbal pharmacology and toxicology has definitely added a useful layer of understanding.
while i know of some western herbalists who, after years of study and experience, have developed their own effective methods, the lack of a coherent and systematic approach makes their insights difficult to communicate to the next generation.
for example, the traditional chinese term "deficiency of yin" has no simple corresponding equivalent in western medicine.
the whole ecology and permaculture movement in the u.s. is a more compatible fit with the sensibilities of most american natural health patrons, and it makes sense to integrate this into a comprehensive herbal tradition rather than to be dependent exclusively on imported herbs.
i was instantly impressed by the level of detail in the assessment system.
there are numerous herbs with broad-spectrum antibacterial and antiviral activity; much more important to consider are matching the herbal formula to the stage of the fever, degree of thirst and dehydration, presence or absence of delirium, rashes, hemorrhaging, excessive perspiration, etc.
when i first became interested in herbs 30 years ago, i had read several books by western herbalists, starting with john christopher, and taking a number of classes.

he was personally much more interested in the work of gerson and several mexican cancer doctors; he was especially interested in accessing the detailed gerson archives and reevaluating them with his newly acquired knowlege of tcm.

the cases of aids i've seen were all over the map as far as tcm patterns and formulas that were given.
one colleague who has taught at a tcm college informs me that 80% of tcm students feel unprepared to use herbs and eventually give up on them, primarily because the obsession with rote memorization has not prepared them with the practical skills necessary for analyzing and working through a clinical case.
while tcm doctors give lip service to the idea of good diet, ayurvedic doctors place much greater emphasis on diet, and this aspect is certainly important in dealing with american clients whose diets are typically disastrous.

the naturopathic and alternative health community has made many interesting and very likely effective improvements for dealing with cancer.
thus for the state-space pattern "deficiency of lung yin", which is a dry-hot pattern affecting the lungs and throat, one would then go to the corresponding state-space for herbal properties and search for an herb or combination of herbs whose net effect would be to moisten-cool.
adulteration and species substitutions are a significant problem among many chinese herb wholesalers and distributors.
as traditional chinese herbology is a descriptive, phenomenological system, its insights remain valid regardless of advances in scientific materialism (materialistic causality).
i advocate that new students new to tcm, especially medical doctors and nurses,temporarily set aside their medical way of thinking while learning tcm theory and assessment.
for more discussion of how traditional chinese theory of feverish illnesses (wen bing) is applied practically, see: although ayurveda has useful insights to offer, its system of assessment if far less sophisticated; this becomes evident when comparing textbooks on tcm assessment (with typically around 120-140 distinct patterns defined and discussed) with those of ayurveda.

i've used this information in simple diet and cooking classes for clients.
instead of rote memorization, since 1998 we at rmhi have developed interactive computer game software to help students learn basic theory and data: computer-aided instruction in tcm clinical analysis and decision-making skills since i'd estimate that 70-80% of all illnesses in america are due to diet and environmental factors, it is important to keep up with the latest discoveries in nutritional sciences and environmental health issues.

one can speculate as to all the physiological phenomena that might result in this pattern, such as insufficient thyroid hormone.
(so, for example, one can have a client with a combination of liver qi stagnation plus liver yang rising and deficiency of spleen qi - a pattern thatmight manifest as a case of simultaneous irritable moods, hypertension, migraine headaches, plus intestinal "dysbiosis" - and this complex pattern can be described mathematically in the defined state space and quantified numerically.
after flailing about for a while, i began reading several textbooks of chinese herbology recommended by an acupuncturist friend.
