the photo of this unique looking, early european design car caught my eye while waiting for the bus to the airport.
we’ve incorporated this trip into ourinvitational photo tours schedule so we’ll be meeting numerous guests who’ve become friends and a few new faces that have never traveled with us before.
our alaskan brown bear trip is fast approaching and i wanted to take a few minutes to post some information for those of you who plan to join us.
last night mark downloaded the ice chart and the pack ice is 80 miles to the north.
in short, the sensor produced great images to start with when using a low iso and then genuine fractals did the rest.
boththese cameras are apparently doing very well.
they never published any calendar we did together that featured the photography smaller than 16×20 inches and never once did they complain.

my wife tanya is stepping in here to describe our morning and the rest of the day as we head further north and east.
the files were actually quite good from the d2h unless you went over 400 iso.
it can’t be easy but amazingly they are more savvy than i have ever seen in the nearly 30 years i’ve worked with them.
the moment she boarded the bobbing smorgasbord of blubber, skin and barnacles, the feasting young bruin came sprinting down the carcass length, diving off the other end, leaping into the water in a full race horse gallop.
if you’re interested you can read about my last trip to this amazing wilderness on our blog/corkboard.
with the announcement of the gf2 panasonic seems to have taken two steps back when they could have gone two steps forward.
the story jeanne described, as usual, was hilarious with the central theme pivoting on the idea that the agent just could not get the concept that the boat she was scheduled to board was something smaller than the typical 1500 passenger cruise ship.
understand that i was one of the very few photographers who actually bought nikon’s d2h that sported a measly 4.1 megapixel sensor.
i like the pro roller option the best since obviously i can keep my eye on my gear.
i hooked this little device up to the d7000 several times and it recorded those images with an exact gps location that are noted as a small red pin on the places section within aperture.
no comments » july 20, 2011 our trip from montana was uneventful – though flying anymore i find literally painful.
acclimating to a new time zone slowly can make all the difference on the first part of any adventure.
i specifically state nikon since canon’s version of the flexible program is a bit different and can be frustrating to rely on.
not the largest they make in the pro roller series but not the smallest either.
the ice is nearly 80 miles offshore, so any bears that are stranded on the islands of svalbard migrate towards the top getting as close to the ice pack as possible.
svalbard, norway two years ago on my first trip to svalbard we found a dead whale, floating in the waters of holmiabukta.
read more... on our recent winter photography tour to yellowstone national park i had a chance to capture some exciting images that just would not have been possible without the high iso capabilities of the nikon d700.
if nikon can sell to the masses, the technology and research eventually makes it over to the more serious professional side.
was easy enough to straighten out but i’m guessing the connection is going to give at some point if i continue doing that.

posted in conservation & education, news worthy, the arctic documentary project | 1 comment » november 9th, 2010 hoping nikon steps up to the challenge of a disappointing gf2 panasonic recently announced the new gf2 and i am sorely disappointed.
mark tells me that, “typically the ice is 15-20 miles offshore but this year is unusual.”
olympus and panasonic chose the micro 4/3′s route with a magnification factor of 2x. nikon decided to go with an even smaller sensor that has a magnification factor of 2.7x. below i’ve included a graphic provided bycameradebate.com that gives you an easier to understand visual of the differences between all these different sized digital capture sensors.
that’s been the description for hotter than normal temperatures and the varying climatic changes they’ve caused.
he loves all cars and fgured he’s never see one like this.
if so these cameras could be amazing.
he saw the picture i posted of tanya with all our bags and asked if there was any camera gear inside.
nikon has given us several options for changing the camera over to a dx format which also increases the frame rate.
for two days now we’ve had skies with virtually no clouds.
however, i believe if more photographers would investigate the benefits of the flexible program option, in the nikon system, they would come to understand the tremendous benefits.

please note that the size of the visuals are not the actual size of the sensors but rather size comparisons of all options.
all of these issues required the use of a great sensor that can handle low-light conditions with ease.
this business of taking pictures creates a lot of baggage.
by zipping out the inside protective enclosure you remove the hard sided outer shell.
our hotel was a best western not far from where we landed and it was typically european with very small rooms but an equally comfortable bed.
our boat is full again, housing our eight invited photo enthusiasts that all arrived on schedule.
additionally, i shot that camera like i do all digital cameras which means i shot it as if i were shooting 35mm film.
first and foremost when in the alaska wilderness you want to make sure you stay dry so i highly recommend bringing a good quality rain/waterproof jacket.
as i mentioned in an earlier post, it seems there is another camera missing from nikon’s lineup that truly would be a competitor to the eos 5d mark iii.
i’ll be snooping and pocking and asking lots of questions about this, that and lots of other things.
a guess but enough time in the outdoors makes it relatively accurate.
true to form she had a huge smile on her face and lots of great stories about the turmoil she faced trying to explain to the “lost luggage department” where they needed to deliver her bags once they found them.
surprisingly, with all the necessary restrictions we had a fairly productive shoot capturing walrus coming and going.
i carry a small body with a minimum of 28mm lens to record special moments that i find while traveling.
additional reasons for needing the ability to go to a higher iso was the relatively low light due to it being early morning with heavy overcast and falling snow.

i can see this being extremely useful for documenting specific areas within the arctic for the arctic documentary project.
i’ll be getting something a bit more robust for my travels in the future but for now the air temperature feels something close to 45f.
the one downside is that the device plugs into the side of the camera and makes it a bit uncomfortable to hold not to mention i’ve bent the connection at least twice.

it was reasonably small (not too small), has interchangeable lenses, has some (not enough) out of menu, manual controls, produces extremely high quality raw files, has almost no shutter lag and has the feel and build of a leica rangefinder to me it was a phenomenal first step for panasonic and their efforts to enter the serious still photography market.
