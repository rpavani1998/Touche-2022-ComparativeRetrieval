it appears that any object that reflects near ir has a tendency to run up the blue channel response in the d2h, which in turn makes for slight color shifts and increased noise.
a new en-el4 lithium battery is used, and we can see exact battery life remaining.
the bottom line remains the same, however: nikon has produced a sensor of their own design, and it's competitive with other technologies.
about the only thing i could find that draws down the battery quickly is very long bulb exposures or tethered use.
handling nikon is learning.
drawbacks potentially long reach for small hands.
in particular, if you hold the camera primarily using the front grip, you'll find the thumb reach to the autofocus direction pad is a little long.
nikon disclaims all but blower bulb cleaning, and you can't clean without an ac adapter.
other than screen doors and a few fabrics, i haven't seen any moire that i'd worry about, though.
the d2h is not a camera you can shoot at anything other than proper exposure.
nef and jpeg files can be written simultaneously for each image, and you can choose the size and quality of the jpeg file to be written.
that alone should send shivers down sony's spine, as now the four leaders in dslr sales, canon, kodak, fujifilm, and nikon all have sensor technology of their own.
on the flip side, the silly camera end cap is a detail i could have lived without.
white balance itself is measured via a dedicated incident sensor at the front of the viewfinder.
if you learn where all the controls are, there's no reason to take your eye from the finder, exactly the way you want a camera designed for action photography.
first, it's smaller than the en-4 that was in the d1 series.
batteries charge modestly fast.
one handling aspect that's welcomed is the new information in the viewfinder.
even a five-minute exposure seems free of hot pixels and obvious dark current noise, though bringing up shadow detail reveals that there's some there.
the af-on and ae-l buttons have been slightly offset at a diagonal so that they're easier to distinguish from one another (the af-on is the upper button).
the voice annotation button is deeply recessed (you have to really want to use it to access it--thus you don't accidentally waste space recording noise due to accidental pressing).
note that flash emits a great deal of near ir and ir light, and i've indeed run into the problem more often indoors using flash than elsewhere.
indeed, nikon's noise reduction techniques seem relatively simple (dark current substraction, etc.) compared to canon's.
this particular sensor is designed for speed.
color integrity is usually excellent, just as it has been with previous nikon dslrs, but with one caveat, which i'll get to in a moment.
with the wrong card, it's merely mid-pack to fast.
recommended, if you need a dslr that can handle action, the d2h will have you covered.
as noted earlier, expectations were sky-high after nikon's hype at the d2h launch.
more often than not the green bias shows up in shaded areas--if a subject is well and evenly lit and you've set the white balance correctly, this problem isn't present.
unfortunately, if you have smallish hands, as i do, you'll find some of the positions of controls are wrong.
several charges from under 30% power remaining have taken just a bit under 90 minutes; nikon claims about a 100 minute full charge time, and i've yet to have any charge go that long.
you have a choice of three color spaces, and the srgb and adobergb spaces seem accurate in my early testing, again with some caveats (see end of paragraph and next paragraph).
since white balance is easier to master on this camera than previous nikon dslrs, it all adds up to getting solid color results for those paying attention.
custom white balance can be done from a gray card or the incident white balance meter in the camera.
personally, i do prefer edge acuity over resolution, but i also don't produce large fine art prints from my work.
and that's not even considering that i need to carry yet another set of batteries and charger for my aa's used in the flash units.
you won't be able to get away with such cavalier design long term.
custom settings have been grouped in a meaningful way, getting rid of the old scroll-through-30+-functions method of locating what you want to set.
lines are clean, markings are clear, and there's less of impromptu design feel to it than we had in the d1 series.
one disappointment to nef shooters is that the buffer is no more than 16 images in size when noise reduction is on (14 when shooting compressed nef with jpeg), 25 with it off.
some of the stuff is minor (like the grouped and named custom settings), but it still adds up to making an already flexible camera even more so.
that's certainly not true in the horizontal axis, but people are interpreting sharp-appearing d2h images as having more resolution than anti-aliased d1x images, which is wrong.
but it still provides some flexibility that wasn't on previous models.
well weatherproofed, nothing sticking out to get clipped off in abusive handling, controls that are designed for use with gloves, magnesium alloy body with padding in the right places.
and that's not even considering that i need to carry yet another set of batteries and charger for my aa's used in the flash units.
still, an unsharpened d2h image set next to the same number of pixels from a d100 or d1x simply looks like it has the more detail due to the acuity produced by the thinner low pass filter.
indeed, even in shots of birds and other animals with fine feathers or hairs i haven't seen color fringing or moire.
overall, yes, near ir response is down (bjorn rosslett reports that it's two stops different than the d100; it doesn't quite seem that much with the filter i use, but itis a noticeable difference).
in particular, nikon has used a thinner, less aggressive low pass (anti-aliasing) filter.
the d2h's sensor is a new design from a new player in sensor design, and has a high bar to get over just to achieve parity with other sensors that are several generations old.
most of the translations i saw--and the comments made by nikon officials at the us and european launchs--led everyone to believe that the claim was "the pixels from a d2h will be lower in noise than any existing camera."
this particular sensor is designed for speed.
on the flip side, the large number of buttons required for a digital body are all well marked, large, and nicely recessed on the d2h.
essentially, you have to "assemble" the end cap and battery every time you change batteries.
third, you get relatively accurate charge remaining information, should you need it.
new controls, more options, and improved user control all around.
battery performance is superb.
second, the fact that nikon uses dual-channel processing on the chip is what gives the camera
unfortunately we get new battery chargers and ac adapters because of this.
if i want to carry a d2h and another nikon body as backup, i now have to carry two sets of batteries, two sets of battery chargers, and two sets of ac adapters (to allow sensor cleaning).
i'd like even more control over the patterns used by the autofocus sensors (e.g., "detect only horizontal motion").
flash is much better with i-ttl than it is with d-ttl, and you have more control and multiple flash ttl with the new system.
one potential problem with nikon's decision on the filter: there will be a stronger tendency to produce color moire patterns on fine, repeating detail; this is not a camera destined to for serious fashion shoots, imho.
so the trade-off is better detail at the expense of potential moire.
i've seen others on the internet already start incorrectly making the comment that the d2h's resolution is higher than the d1x's.
white balance itself is measured via a dedicated incident sensor at the front of the viewfinder.
the af-on and ae-l buttons have been slightly offset at a diagonal so that they're easier to distinguish from one another (the af-on is the upper button).
[here at the end of 2004, a few cameras are starting to catch up; but the d2h still remains state-of-the-art, which is saying something for a camera that's been out for more than year.]
if nikon targeted action shooters with this camera (they did), they hit a bull's eye.
while some might ask for more megapixels, i'm willing to wait for a d2x based upon the same design that trades speed for resolution.
that's not my take after re-reading the japanese slides and press accounts of the launch in tokyo.
i'll not repeat the full list of features here, but instead point out some of the things that are changed or added from the d1 series: on this last point i must criticize nikon severely: traveling photographers--of which i'm most certainly one--already have to cope with carrying more equipment after the transition to digital.
custom settings banks can be named, making it easier to remember what's different about bank b than bank a.
not only will you know how many shots are left on your card (or how many you've taken), but you can see white balance settings, iso, image quality settings, and more.
excellent 4mp image quality.
one aspect of noise i can report on with positive results is long-exposure noise.
less obvious than all the external changes is the sensor, buried deep in the all-black body.
first off, let me say that this is a stylish body design.
coupled with a shutter release lag of as little as 37ms, this has got to be the fastest (non-pellicle)
i'm adjusting that slightly: while the overall amount of near ir that is usable in ir imagry is less, there appears to be an abnormal blue channel response that contributes to noise and color shift, as noted above.
if you have large hands (can get more than an octave spread on the piano) or are shooting with gloves, these positions are less problematic, but be forewarned: nikon isn't designing for small hands.
sensor cleaning is no different with the new model than previous.
other than screen doors and a few fabrics, i haven't seen any moire that i'd worry about, though.
a new flash technology has been added, which nikon's schizophrenic marketing department can't quite decide whether to call i-ttl or cls (creative lighting system).
others on the net have noted that use of a hot mirror filter (filters out near ir) changes the camera's noise and color tendencies with certain fabrics and objects.
the autofocus area mode selector (hey i don't make these names up) is going to confuse many, however, at least at first.
even a one stop underexposure will bring up the noise level, and two stops will make it noticeably visible.
i can't imagine a situation where i'd need more than two batteries for a day's shoot, though there may be a few prolific photojournalists out there that disagree.
well, we need to peel those folk down from the ceiling and get them off the drugs they're using.
but you have to learn the nuances to get the most from it, especially since both the group dynamic autofocus and default autofocus positions re-introduce closest subject priority as an option.
and then you may find that you don't have enough megapixels for really large print sizes (i'm getting spoiled by thekodak pro 14n's prodigious pixel creation).
in particular, nikon has used a thinner, less aggressive low pass (anti-aliasing) filter.
a 10-minute exposure can pull the battery down 25% or slightly more.
if you accidentally leave the camera on overnight with a full battery, the camera still claims ~87% battery charge 24 hours later, and that figure seems accurate.
but with a wa enabled card or other state-of-the-art card, write performance on the d2h is faster than any dslr i've encountered to date, and by a fairly comfortable margin.
even a one stop underexposure will bring up the noise level, and two stops will make it noticeably visible.
the fact that people are asking for even more shows you just how far digital cameras are moving.
the autofocus area mode selector (hey i don't make these names up) is going to confuse many, however, at least at first.
second, it doesn't have any exposed contacts, so you don't have to worry about putting that little plastic end cap on when you stick multiple batteries into a pack or pocket.
acuity is good, color is excellent, and noise performance is at least as good as previous nikons, if not better.
edge acuity is pretty darned good, though it comes with a minor caveat (potential moire).
on this last point i must criticize nikon severely: traveling photographers--of which i'm most certainly one--already have to cope with carrying more equipment after the transition to digital.
even so, iso 1600 and even 3200 are quite usable with post production noise reduction--the primary loss is one of color saturation and contrast, not detail.
indeed, nikon's noise reduction techniques seem relatively simple (dark current substraction, etc.) compared to canon's.
indeed, if you shoot less than 500 images in a session, you'll probably do fine with just one battery.
i wish the reach to the autofocus direction pad was better for my hands, but even though i have to stretch to reach it, i still like this system a lot.
this means that the capture acuity is actually visibly higher on the d2h than it is on the d1x.
specifically, that it had the low-power and direct addressing characteristics of cmos and the low-noise and dark current properties of a ccd.
second, it doesn't have any exposed contacts, so you don't have to worry about putting that little plastic end cap on when you stick multiple batteries into a pack or pocket.
if you were confused by single area af versus dynamic area af, you're going to need to study these new controls--they add a great degree of choice to your autofocus options, but they are not obviously intuitive, even to veteran nikon users.
i've seen others on the internet already start incorrectly making the comment that the d2h's resolution is higher than the d1x's.
buffer could be bigger.
in an earlier iteration of this review i wrote that "near infrared is blocked more on this camera than on previous nikon dslrs."
if i want to carry a d2h and another nikon body as backup, i now have to carry two sets of batteries, two sets of battery chargers, and two sets of ac adapters (to allow sensor cleaning).
that alone should send shivers down sony's spine, as now the four leaders in dslr sales, canon, kodak, fujifilm, and nikon all have sensor technology of their own.
note that acuity is not the same as resolution, however.
one aspect of noise i can report on with positive results is long-exposure noise.
overall, handling aspects have improved slightly from the d1 series (which was already quite good), though those with small hands need to be aware that they might be uncomfortable with the reach to the autofocus direction pad and af-on/ae-l buttons.
that's not my take after re-reading the japanese slides and press accounts of the launch in tokyo.
thus, i didn't really have any clear expectations on how noisy or how un-noisy the d2h images will be.
we'll get to actual sensor performance later in the review, but i do want to emphasize a couple of things: the fact that this is a jfet chip means that one of the power-hogs in the d1 series has been eliminated.
but when you've got neutrals in a shaded areaand a well lit other area, you can easily see it.
the camera can track vertical position and auto-rotate images in nikon view.
we'll get to actual sensor performance later in the review, but i do want to emphasize a couple of things: the fact that this is a jfet chip means that one of the power-hogs in the d1 series has been eliminated.
if you're going to get a d2h, be prepared to get at least one (and probably two) sb-800 speedlights, as well.
about the only thing i could find that draws down the battery quickly is very long bulb exposures or tethered use.
thus, i didn't really have any clear expectations on how noisy or how un-noisy the d2h images will be.

essentially, you have to "assemble" the end cap and battery every time you change batteries.
but when you've got neutrals in a shaded areaand a well lit other area, you can easily see it.
once you learn how all the controls interact and find the settings that work for the situations you photograph, you'll find that the new autofocus system is fast, sure, and reliable.
but the blue channel appears to respond to near ir light, which it shouldn't be doing (near ir should all be picked up only in the red channel).
fortunately, the metering system is accurate and flexible, so there's really no excuse for getting exposures wrong.
ironically, canon is one of the few makers of a 77mm hot mirror filter, and nikon doesn't make one.
this is a very typical example of what happens when talented engineers don't pay enough attention to users.
the camera uses usb 2.0 for computer connections and connection to the optional wt-1 wireless transmitter.
it appears that curves and placement of ridges was more carefully considered to help handling characteristics.
and if you are having problems with that, use an sb-800 set up toonly provide af-assist illumination (you can finally set it up so that no flash triggers).
i'm comfortable in saying that nikon achieved parity or better, although the exact aspects of that are the stuff that require much more verbiage to describe accurately, especially given the near ir issue.
this shows just how much power conservation is going on normally; a lot!
if you have large hands (can get more than an octave spread on the piano) or are shooting with gloves, these positions are less problematic, but be forewarned: nikon isn't designing for small hands.
performance battery performance is superb.
an 11-sensor array covers all but the corners of the image area, and can be configured to operate in enough different ways to confound even those that study the manual carefully.
technically, it's nearly a cmos-type sensor (except with jfet instead of mosfet transistors).
the list of possible assignments is shorter than i'd like (you should be able to assign it to depth of field for the vertical release, for example),
not only will you know how many shots are left on your card (or how many you've taken), but you can see white balance settings, iso, image quality settings, and more.
ironically, canon is one of the few makers of a 77mm hot mirror filter, and nikon doesn't make one.
while the family heritage is obvious, virtually every significant aspect of the camera has been rethought.
be prepared to spend some quality time with a convenient moving subject practicing with the various autofocus settings.
since the launch event, nikon has been quieter about the noise issues, emphasizing the high speed data processing capabilities of the chip more than the noise tendencies.
the reach for the autofocus direction pad is even greater when holding the camera vertically, and the depth of field button is no longer reachable without moving your hand position off the shutter release (one of the reasons why i said the func button needs to have other options, such as depth of field--you can almost reach that button from the vertical release with small hands).
i'm impressed that nikon has taken the time to try to improve, refine, and innovate in as many places as it has.
even so, iso 1600 and even 3200 are quite usable with post production noise reduction--the primary loss is one of color saturation and contrast, not detail.
even though the d2h has a dark-frame subtraction noise reduction feature that can be set, i'm not really seeing the need for it until you get out to very long exposures.
a hot mirror filter does seem to eradicate the problem, at the expense of small light loss overall.
compactflash write performance can be superb.
this means that the capture acuity is actually visibly higher on the d2h than it is on the d1x.
the iso, qual, and wb buttons are larger than on the d1 series, and again nicely recessed yet accessible.
autofocus performance is superb, though requires learning to use well.
it's easy enough to deal with, but annoying.
but with a wa enabled card or other state-of-the-art card, write performance on the d2h is faster than any dslr i've encountered to date, and by a fairly comfortable margin.
the claim that was made is that lbcast chip itself is inherently less noisy than an equivalent cmos sensor.
fast frame rate, fast mirror return, fast shutter lag, fast autofocus, fast, fast, fast.
now that we have a better battery, i'd like more control over the self timer settings, especially longer ones.
i will say that the quality of the d2h noise is nice, at least up to iso 800.
if you accidentally leave the camera on overnight with a full battery, the camera still claims ~87% battery charge 24 hours later, and that figure seems accurate.
second, the fact that nikon uses dual-channel processing on the chip is what gives the camera the ability to run at 8 frames per second.
white balance can be set directly in kelvin values, and white balance now has its own dedicated sensor at the front of the prism; custom white balance is simple, can be done in two different ways, and you can save settings with names you provide.
indeed, if you shoot less than 500 images in a session, you'll probably do fine with just one battery.
[of course, canon countered by updating the 1d, which now has a larger buffer and comes closer to matching the length of the d2h's burst.]
speaking of the viewfinder, the blackout time during shots is so minimal that you'll easily be able to follow action at 8 fps.
white balance is more flexible and more easily controlled than before.
connections to the camera (video, ac in, usb 2.0) all attach via connectors on the left side of the camera.
the camera seems to power down gracefully, for example, much like the old film bodies.
as much as the next guy, i'd love to see a breakthrough in image noise tendencies.
fortunately, the metering system is accurate and flexible, so there's really no excuse for getting exposures wrong.
and if you are having problems with that, use an sb-800 set up toonly provide af-assist illumination (you can finally set it up so that no flash triggers).
with the wrong card, it's merely mid-pack to fast.
with the right settings and discipline, this camera performs more like a 5mp or higher camera.
as noted earlier, expectations were sky-high after nikon's hype at the d2h launch.
by that i mean that it is random and more grain-like than the mosaic, banded, and color-blotched noise you often see in digital images.
nikon literature refers to it as a jfet lbcast sensor (junction field effect transistor, lateral buried charge accumulator and sensing transistor array) because that describes the unique design that underlies each photosite.
it's both easy to activate a function as well as not easy to accidentally activate a function.
the wireless transmitter allows 802.11b ftp transfers from camera to computer at ranges up to 500 feet (with the optional extension antenna; otherwise 100 feet).
i can't imagine a situation where i'd need more than two batteries for a day's shoot, though there may be a few prolific photojournalists out there that disagree.
you won't be able to get away with such cavalier design long term.
this shows just how much power conservation is going on normally; a lot!
white balance settings can be "obtained" from images already on the storage card.
the ability to run at 8 frames per second.
the viewfinder now features additional informational displays--virtually every significant setting can be seen without taking your eye from the finder.
connections to the camera (video, ac in, usb 2.0) all attach via connectors on the left side of the camera.
others on the net have noted that use of a hot mirror filter (filters out near ir) changes the camera's noise and color tendencies with certain fabrics and objects.
overall, yes, near ir response is down (bjorn rosslett reports that it's two stops different than the d100; it doesn't quite seem that much with the filter i use, but itis a noticeable difference).
an interval timer has been added to allow time-lapse and unattended photography.
color integrity is usually excellent, just as it has been with previous nikon dslrs, but with one caveat, which i'll get to in a moment.
again, it would be nice to have 8mp and a bit better noise handling at high iso values, but that's really about all that's necessary to put the d2h on the top of the heap again.
some other reviewers have remarked about getting more saturation out of their d2h shots, but once i make my usual post-processing adjustments i don't see any significant difference from older nikon dslrs.
as much as the next guy, i'd love to see a breakthrough in image noise tendencies.
lines are clean, markings are clear, and there's less of impromptu design feel to it than we had in the d1 series.
the blue channel seems to respond to near ir, and a hot mirror filter fixes the problem.
unlike the d1 series, the rubber doors that sit over these connectors seem to stay closed, and provide a pretty good weather seal.
more often than not the green bias shows up in shaded areas--if a subject is well and evenly lit and you've set the white balance correctly, this problem isn't present.
if you were confused by single area af versus dynamic area af, you're going to need to study these new controls--they add a great degree of choice to your autofocus options, but they are not obviously intuitive, even to veteran nikon users.
the autofocus, exposure, flash, long-exposure noise, and color saturation performance of this camera are superb.
color accuracy is good with caveats that can be dealt with.
on the flip side, the silly camera end cap is a detail i could have lived without.
edge acuity is pretty darned good, though it comes with a minor caveat (potential moire).
likewise, reaching to hit the af-on or ae-l buttons with your thumb tends to move your hand position back around the grip, which means you don't have quite as solid a hold on the camera.
unfortunately, if you have smallish hands, as i do, you'll find some of the positions of controls are wrong.
i-ttl works, and it restores multiple flash ability.
since the launch event, nikon has been quieter about the noise issues, emphasizing the high speed data processing capabilities of the chip more than the noise tendencies.
again, it would be nice to have 8mp and a bit better noise handling at high iso values, but that's really about all that's necessary to put the d2h on the top of the heap again.

overall, handling aspects have improved slightly from the d1 series (which was already quite good), though those with small hands need to be aware that they might be uncomfortable with the reach to the autofocus direction pad and af-on/ae-l buttons.
for years, we nikon pros have been slowly losing our eyepieces when they rattled out from vibration or whatever; no more.
but the blue channel appears to respond to near ir light, which it shouldn't be doing (near ir should all be picked up only in the red channel).

i wish the reach to the autofocus direction pad was better for my hands, but even though i have to stretch to reach it, i still like this system a lot.
nine of the 11 autofocus sensors are low-light, low-contrast capable, which makes it hard to find a situation where the camera won't focus (though it's still possible).
i use the words "can be" because i have encountered a few older cards that don't achieve the fast write performance the d2h is capable of.
a hot mirror filter does seem to eradicate the problem, at the expense of small light loss overall.
white balance settings can be "obtained" from images already on the storage card.
the fact that people are asking for even more shows you just how far digital cameras are moving.
well, we need to peel those folk down from the ceiling and get them off the drugs they're using.
indeed, since you can pull up a histogram with a center press of the autofocus direction pad, make that pull up the current luminance histogram and then put the channel histograms on other info pages you browse through.
at high iso values, though, the mosaic rears its head on the d2h, though banding seems pretty well under control on my sample.
finally, since each photosite is directly addressable, noise reduction and other image processing techniques can be performed at the pixel levelprior to passing to a central dsp (digital signal processor), again potentially speeding up operations.
and there nikon didn't make any significant claims [e.g., they didn't say "our noise reduction techniques are better than canon's].
third, you get relatively accurate charge remaining information, should you need it.
even a five-minute exposure seems free of hot pixels and obvious dark current noise, though bringing up shadow detail reveals that there's some there.
note, however, that both lbcast and cmos absolutely require that you run noise reduction techniques on the photosite data.
it's easy enough to deal with, but annoying.
thus, we have our work cut out just running down the feature set and changes to it.
the color lcd is bigger and brighter than before.
first, it's smaller than the en-4 that was in the d1 series.
the iso, qual, and wb buttons are larger than on the d1 series, and again nicely recessed yet accessible.
this is a big camera, and shooters with small hands won't find all the controls quite where they want them.
[here at the end of 2004, a few cameras are starting to catch up; but the d2h still remains state-of-the-art, which is saying something for a camera that's been out for more than year.]
since the battery charge is known, the cleaning mode really should allow cleaning with a battery (if remaining power is greater than xx%).
the vertical grip continues that problem.
it appears that any object that reflects near ir has a tendency to run up the blue channel response in the d2h, which in turn makes for slight color shifts and increased noise.
custom settings banks can be named, making it easier to remember what's different about bank b than bank a.
be prepared to spend some quality time with a convenient moving subject practicing with the various autofocus settings.
cleaning the ccd i've now posted an article on how to clean the ccd.
i will say that the quality of the d2h noise is nice, at least up to iso 800.
note, however, that both lbcast and cmos absolutely require that you run noise reduction techniques on the photosite data.
i'm comfortable in saying that nikon achieved parity or better, although the exact aspects of that are the stuff that require much more verbiage to describe accurately, especially given the near ir issue.
ai and later manual focus lenses can be used with the matrix meter (after a bit of data input, and only in aperture-priority and manual exposure modes).
in an earlier iteration of this review i wrote that "near infrared is blocked more on this camera than on previous nikon dslrs."
custom white balance can be done from a gray card or the incident white balance meter in the camera.
while the family heritage is obvious, virtually every significant aspect of the camera has been rethought.
the problem, of course, is that canon's offering, the 1d mark ii, has an 8mp sensor, so nikon really does need to address the d2h's resolution gap to stay even in the race.
i use the words "can be" because i have encountered a few older cards that don't achieve the fast write performance the d2h is capable of.
indeed, even in shots of birds and other animals with fine feathers or hairs i haven't seen color fringing or moire.
noise also shows up in underexposed images more readily.

technically, it's nearly a cmos-type sensor (except with jfet instead of mosfet transistors).
one potential problem with nikon's decision on the filter: there will be a stronger tendency to produce color moire patterns on fine, repeating detail; this is not a camera destined to for serious fashion shoots, imho.
the autofocus direction pad now has a center push ability, which is used to advantage in a number of different ways (it brings up the histogram when an image is displayed, for example).
personally, i do prefer edge acuity over resolution, but i also don't produce large fine art prints from my work.
nikon disclaims all but blower bulb cleaning, and you can't clean without an ac adapter.
i'll not repeat the full list of features here, but instead point out some of the things that are changed or added from the d1 series: the vertical shooting grip gets a front command dial.
while that's still at least two seconds at 8 fps, it is a limit that you can reach while shooting intensive action.
this is a very typical example of what happens when talented engineers don't pay enough attention to users.
the center area in one of her paintings just wouldn't get the color right, and it had a bit of strange noise in it (the rest of the painting was color accurate, as expected).
it appears that burst write speeds on the d2h can be as much as 2x the d100 with a wa card (you can't directly compare file write speeds, as the file sizes are different).rob galbraith has tabulated d2h write performance on his site, and my results are right in line with his--with the right card the d2h is state-of-the-art fast.
thus, while the sensor itself may produce less noise in photosite data than, say, canon's cmos sensor, it still needs to be run through noise reduction.
the claim that was made is that lbcast chip itself is inherently less noisy than an equivalent cmos sensor.
by that i mean that it is random and more grain-like than the mosaic, banded, and color-blotched noise you often see in digital images.
the d2h's sensor is a new design from a new player in sensor design, and has a high bar to get over just to achieve parity with other sensors that are several generations old.
if you learn where all the controls are, there's no reason to take your eye from the finder, exactly the way you want a camera designed for action photography.

thus, we have our work cut out just running down the feature set and changes to it.
some other reviewers have remarked about getting more saturation out of their d2h shots, but once i make my usual post-processing adjustments i don't see any significant difference from older nikon dslrs.
despite this somewhat later-than-expected arrival, the d2h only provides a 4 megapixel sensor, which basically matches what the canon 1d had (for some time), and is only half what the canon 1d mark ii came out with.
i'm adjusting that slightly: while the overall amount of near ir that is usable in ir imagry is less, there appears to be an abnormal blue channel response that contributes to noise and color shift, as noted above.
the sound is one that spun a canon 1d shooter's head around faster than linda blair's in the exorcist (doubleclick on the picture below to download the sound to your computer).
the nikon dslr report is the only way to learn more about getting the most from your camera.
for years, we nikon pros have been slowly losing our eyepieces when they rattled out from vibration or whatever; no more.
the autofocus system is completely new, quite complex, and versatile.

i'm impressed that nikon has taken the time to try to improve, refine, and innovate in as many places as it has.
unlike the d1 series, the rubber doors that sit over these connectors seem to stay closed, and provide a pretty good weather seal.
a 10-minute exposure can pull the battery down 25% or slightly more.
that's certainly not true in the horizontal axis, but people are interpreting sharp-appearing d2h images as having more resolution than anti-aliased d1x images, which is wrong.
likewise, reaching to hit the af-on or ae-l buttons with your thumb tends to move your hand position back around the grip, which means you don't have quite as solid a hold on the camera.
wedding photographers are going to swoon over the flash capabilities.
it appears that curves and placement of ridges was more carefully considered to help handling characteristics.
once you learn how all the controls interact and find the settings that work for the situations you photograph, you'll find that the new autofocus system is fast, sure, and reliable.
this means that i have to travel with my extra cost ac adapter.
the new battery is nice in a couple of ways.
nine of the 11 autofocus sensors are low-light, low-contrast capable, which makes it hard to find a situation where the camera won't focus (though it's still possible).
the center area in one of her paintings just wouldn't get the color right, and it had a bit of strange noise in it (the rest of the painting was color accurate, as expected).
finally, since each photosite is directly addressable, noise reduction and other image processing techniques can be performed at the pixel levelprior to passing to a central dsp (digital signal processor), again potentially speeding up operations.
batteries charge modestly fast.
nikon literature refers to it as a jfet lbcast sensor (junction field effect transistor, lateral buried charge accumulator and sensing transistor array) because that describes the unique design that underlies each photosite.
requires sb-800 for best flash.
other sensor-related items have changed, as well.
on the flip side, the large number of buttons required for a digital body are all well marked, large, and nicely recessed on the d2h.
most of the translations i saw--and the comments made by nikon officials at the us and european launchs--led everyone to believe that the claim was "the pixels from a d2h will be lower in noise than any existing camera."
less obvious than all the external changes is the sensor, buried deep in the all-black body.
voice annotation is built in.
i actually mashed my d2h shutter release down recently just to see what the canon shooters near me would do.
thus, while the sensor itself may produce less noise in photosite data than, say, canon's cmos sensor, it still needs to be run through noise reduction.
but you have to learn the nuances to get the most from it, especially since both the group dynamic autofocus and default autofocus positions re-introduce closest subject priority as an option.
if you do scenic work, as i do, you need dx lenses to restore your wide angle due to the 1.5x angle of view change.
note that flash emits a great deal of near ir and ir light, and i've indeed run into the problem more often indoors using flash than elsewhere.
moreover, a side location is better than the previous front location if you hold cameras in the traditional manner (left hand under lens, right hand on grip).
in particular, if you hold the camera primarily using the front grip, you'll find the thumb reach to the autofocus direction pad is a little long.
the list of specification changes or additions i'd ask for is relatively minimal: it would be nice to have iso 100 (to match all the charts published in nikon flash manuals, including the sb-800).
so the trade-off is better detail at the expense of potential moire.
you have a choice of three color spaces, and the srgb and adobergb spaces seem accurate in my early testing, again with some caveats (see end of paragraph and next paragraph).
specifically, that it had the low-power and direct addressing characteristics of cmos and the low-noise and dark current properties of a ccd.
the d2h is not a camera you can shoot at anything other than proper exposure.
and there nikon didn't make any significant claims [e.g., they didn't say "our noise reduction techniques are better than canon's].
the bottom line remains the same, however: nikon has produced a sensor of their own design, and it's competitive with other technologies.
color accuracy is good with caveats that can be dealt with.
the problem, of course, is that canon's offering, the 1d mark ii, has an 8mp sensor, so nikon really does need to address the d2h's resolution gap to stay even in the race.
moreover, a side location is better than the previous front location if you hold cameras in the traditional manner (left hand under lens, right hand on grip).
