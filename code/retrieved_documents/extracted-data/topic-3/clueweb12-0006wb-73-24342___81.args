it certainly depends on the person using the camera and i believe that you need to have the flare and artistic ability to be able to use any camera (including digital) to produce beautiful images.
i would not sell any of my images.
xiaoyuan gu , november 28, 2007; 10:12 a.m. it is time for canon to throw the goodies of 1d mkiii and 40d to a 5d mkii, to seriously compete with the nikon d3.
not that it matters, but i think one would do better to search for 5d on the eos forum than to pay much attention to the comments here.
i think this is going to be my next birthday present, its just the weight & cost thats going to hurt - ouch.
all canonusa could do for me was apologize and take down my information.
it is also interesting to look here if you want to get one indicator of relative market shares for the various companies, not just canon and nikon--and not just at the high end.
nikon is a versatile system if you are on the street and every moment counts.
too bad even my photos are great with this camera.
i've done both, and personally, digital allows me sooo much more access to my photos.
the learning curve is real and no less valid than that of understanding film and darkroom techniques.
sure, i could build a great vintage camera for much less money than a 5d, but i'd spend more on film, paper, chemicals and processing in 1 month than i would on a good digital camera.
03:13 a.m. i started out with pen and ink, moved to pastels, charcoal, watercolor airbrushing.
however i like to use lenses as with film cameras: no crop factor.
but having a crappy camera and a great eye prevents you from getting the right output especially if you think of commercially gaining from it.
so i am in the same: will continue scanning till they get a product that won't be obsolete in less than five years.
canon is a massive company with the $billions to invest in building semiconductor fabrication lines.
it's always good to hear people getting good cameras for a good price.
i have found some really good deals on medium format cameras.
digital is just someone's opinion, but i find it highly inflammatory for no reason at all.
and we all know that good home cooking is best, but sometimes a quick takeaway hits the spot as well.
if you are a workhorse photographer, that is you are commercial, then you have things like time and money to worry about, and you need to find the best and most efficient and inexpensive tool for the job.
there is a woman who does blurry monotypes from my digital wildlife photos and sells them for more than i can sell the originals.
i have used a canon 1ds mark i and ii and i found the quality to be excellent.
the underscore means the white space was changed from srgb to adobe rgb.
nedine o'brien , february 27, 2007; 06:21 a.m. greetings all, i've only been studying photography for three years and started doing b&w film in a wet darkroom.
the 5d, on the other hand, is better in the following situations: the canon eos 5d has an almost identical and equally simple user interface to the cheaper canon 20d and 30d bodies.
i don't own many lenses - 10.5mm and the 18-70 that came with the d70.
it is maybe not a spectacular, but a very solid and high quality camera that can give very good files.
this is very useful for tripod and macro work.
you can't be going into the bride and groom's face to lock in an exposure reading.
03:13 a.m. i started out with pen and ink, moved to pastels, charcoal, watercolor airbrushing.
one nit: the 100mm f/2 is not the only alternative to the 70-200mm f/2.8l.
its hard to find real photographers now as anyone with a fairly good digital is now branding themselves as pro photographers......
on the lcd skintones look washed out, the finally result on my laptop looked fine
note that, as with most digital single lens reflex cameras, the 5d cannot provide you with a preview in the rear lcd because the sensor is occluded by the viewing mirror until you press the shutter release.
i've had this eos 5d for nearly a year and it has survived a trip through mexico and being vibrated for two cross-country helicopter trips.
flash the canon eos 5d does not have a built-in flash.
about the only reason i can see to ante up the extra money and haul around the added weight of the 70-200mm f/2.8l would be if one routinely takes action pictures in low light or if one is obsessively enamored of blurry backgrounds.
i don't know if the 3" lcd will fit onto the back though.
digital camera which will be 108mp mamiya ofcourse, and it will accept all my rb67 lenses and ektars.
i am aware that there appears to have been a batch of 5d's that had dust problems, but mine (luckly) was not one of them and when i did finally get somedust on the sensor (bad handling on my part), it was easy enough to clean w/o the need for a sensor cleaning kit or canon' service facility.
i never considered film photographers artistic because all one was doing was pushing a button.
although not the fastest camera for action shots, it is hardly "a patient studio photographer's camera," and no one who has used it would characterize it thus.
the 1.6 sensor makes my 400mm 640.
there is a greenish hue to everything, which is unnerving when you are under the gun on a paid shoot.
i don't really mind if their isn't a significant increase in resolution, but i would love to see the dust reduction system and the 3" lcd off the 1d mark iii.
if you are rich and dumb, i would definitly suggest going digital.
i.e., sports photographers might want to consider one of the eos 1d bodies specifically designed for their rapid-fire needs.
i want to be able to deliver to my client larger prints with little or no noise in shadow areas.
i still can't get over that 5d viewfinder, though, and that's the one absolutely unavoidable drawback of four thirds - technology improvements and price/size economies mean the smaller sensors will just lag 35mm sensors by two or three years (in resolution and sensitivity), but there's no way with that imaging circle to get abigger viewfinder image than the e1's.
05:07 a.m. i have had my canon 5d for about 10 weeks now and i love it a superb camera,you can crop a small part of a file and the result is still very good,i also like the idea of changing the iso for each shot when i want to and i can do it just over a second with no bother at all,the only setting i use is the iso 50 setting for when i want to use it,some times i use the mirror setting so when you press the shutter release the mirror shoots up and went you press the shuter release again it will take the photo which is a good idea when taking macro shots as the mirror will not vibrate then !
whatever software you choose to use, you won't have to spend too much time post-processing due to the eos 5d's inclusion of a mercury switch to orient photos.
it is my opinion that it is "cheating" to use some of the more advanced photoshop functions to manipulate your image because they allow you to create a "better" image than you originally captured.
the camera has an internal buffer memory for rapid sequence photography (17 raws or 60 jpegs).
it is disappointing to see the lack of film photography being taught.
that's pretty sad, considering what a tour de force of technology the 5d's sensor is.
more and more people are going digital, thus driving down demand and prices for film gear.
yes, canon can do 14bit ad conversion, but if the pixel picks up only nosier data at first hand, more resolution in the ad stage simply won't help much - (amplifying the noise)?
it's just seems ironic to me that a $3000-2500 camera doesn't have a lcd screen as good as my $500 point and shoot.
it makes an image that goes into the computer nice n easy.
and when i whip out the 11x14 empire state and make selinium oxide silver contact prints (or whatever they are called) you will see who has cooler pictures.
nikon's metering and flash systems are state of the art.
as a keen amateur for 25 years, i've owned a 5d for almost a year now and continue to be wowed by the results it yields, with, like any camera, a discerning eye, a sensitivity for the subject matter and a sense of imagination...
a cheaper alternative but still good is the tamron range of lenses and they go down to f2.8 aswell for a fairly wide angled lens.
no dings, scratches, and best of all no internal damage to camera or lens.
so, i hope he really did have the inside info, and that a canon "5d ii" is on the way.
i could buy the 1ds mark ii as a backup (kidding!).
i do not know about the engineering but i seem to get much better pictures in low light situations with the fullframe.
p.m. combining the 5d's high iso cleanliness + is provides hand held capabilities previously unheard of erwin baeyens , august 13, 2007;
there is a pc connector on the side for studio strobes.
that's pretty sad, considering what a tour de force of technology the 5d's sensor is.
the camera is always ready when you are.
more and more people are going digital, thus driving down demand and prices for film gear.
having taught photography back in the days when dinosaurs were just crawling out from the sea, i think 'wet' photography will be with us for a long time just as oil on canvas is still here.
i do not choose a camera based solely on market share, of course, but such data are not irrelevant to me.
but having a crappy camera and a great eye prevents you from getting the right output especially if you think of commercially gaining from it.
patty larue , october 28, 2010; 10:20 a.m. i have the canon 5d and have been using with the 70-200 heavy lens for portrait work and weddings can someone please tell me what other lens to buy to replace this heavy lens for every day before i have to have surgery my neck can not take it.
i'll be a die hard film fanatic as long as the good men and women at kodak keep cranking out the precious 35mms.
but canon doesn't communicate at all on problems with this particular lens and generally says it efficient in all situations.
i have found some really good deals on medium format cameras.
i have come to really enjoy photogarphy as an artform.
i have been looking at the 5d as my primary and my 30d as my backup so i won't be losing time changing lenses.
they're 13mpx, that's to say near the state of the art for a digital 35mm size-like camera.
i love the medium format slides in the glassed gepe frames.
by that time i hope nikon will also be truly in te (full) frame and be producing a lower price competitor so that i can think aout returning to nikon.
just google the name of the shop and reviews, like, in my case was: "bestpricecameras reviews" so, it seems that the cheapest 40d (not scam) price was around $1000 and the 5d around $2200.
one last thing, i found my 28-80 was not wide enough in some situations for weddings.
evita m , october 17, 2006; 03:42 a.m. "digital camera like canon 5d takes terrific images " i still think it's the one behind the lens who makes an image terrific or not, the camera itself, whatever camera, just makes a picture.
after that i've found so many scams like that one that i recommend everyone doing the same before they buy their camera online.
hi brian-i don't think i am really qualified to answer any questions in this forum but will take a guess at the answer to this one simply because no one else has replied.
i find myself now with amazing distortions (ellypses) and the canon pro services recently told me it was the "inconvenience" of full frame captors.
" it's important to remember that even if you can scan something at a million dots per inch - you may just be fooling yourself.
a photographer has to be more skilled to use film than digital.
for taking pictures of sporting events without breaking your arm, you'll want acanon ef 300mm f/4l is usm, (compare prices) (review).
andrew klerck , may 12, 2007; 04:19 a.m. hey robert, well the 5d is a full frame sensor (like a film slr).
i will never miss the kodak 14n that it replaced, although i occasionally miss the aperture rings on my nikon lenses that i had to sell to be able to get both (1) full frame and (2) low noise at high iso.
the is will help with camera shake more than the extra stop will for the same money.
nedine o'brien , february 27, 2007; 06:21 a.m. greetings all, i've only been studying photography for three years and started doing b&w film in a wet darkroom.
people throw away old computers just like they will throw away digital cameras.
unfortunately that particular lens with 5d seems to produce an elliptical unexpected distortion.
we have millions of average joe's with an $800 dslr that can produce great quality artistic photos.....and that will obviously blow the ego of anyone who's labored in a darkroom for any amount of time.
the eos 30d and digital rebel are better values.
digital has made it too easy for anyone to get into photography (i'm not saying this is a bad thing!).
with the 5d, what you got with your 20mm lens on the film camera is what you get with the 5d. the canon eos 5d is compact and plasticky, but solidly built.
alan cukurs , january 16, 2008; 01:01 a.m. get the 5d. if you like wide, the full frame will be a big benefit.
if you insist on having a wide-to-tele zoom, the standard choice is thecanon ef 24-70mm f/2.8l usm, (compare prices) (review ), which is useful for event photography such as wedding receptions.
in other words an image captured with the camera held vertically will appear on a computer screen in a vertical orientation.
available light photography in available, i.e., low, light is a pleasure with the canon eos 5d because the typical lenses that you'd use with this camera include the standard 50/1.4 from the film world.
i am hoping to use a d2x and get the same quality but maybe the 5d will do well.
no dings, scratches, and best of all no internal damage to camera or lens.
incredible photos, i have no more need for film.
digital pictures are different but damn, some of them are of wonderful color and quality.
a 35mm slide scanned with a 4000dpi scan (like a coolscan 5000) gives to you a 3946x5782=22,8mpx file that you can print 13x18.
although i have never shot either, the specs on the nikon d200 and the nikon d2x are very, very impressive.
that's why 5d is such an amazing gear, will so is the nikon d3.
it is more than good enough for most professional photojournalism applications, but still simple enough that a yuppie can get one to throw in the glovebox of his bmw suv and take pictures at the school soccer game.
after that i've found so many scams like that one that i recommend everyone doing the same before they buy their camera online.
canon 5d or 1d are beautiful cameras but i think film camera are still useful today.
they're 13mpx, that's to say near the state of the art for a digital 35mm size-like camera.
i enjoyed making prints in my dark room i did pr, weddings, events, sports, newspaper work, portraits and even printed some in a couple of other peoples books.
when i got my 5d things changed, there are no 'cheat' modes on this camera, you actually have to know what you are doing.
the is will help with camera shake more than the extra stop will for the same money.
i do, however, use l lenses which i think more important than a couple of megapixels.
my 20d exposes backlighting perfectly and this camera costs over half as much of a 5d.
all in all, the 5d has made me shoot things i would never have shot without it.
no, nikon cannot match canon's sensor technology;they are not the electronics giant that canon is.
he said i should hold off buying it, because that the next upgrade to the 5d was going to be announced pretty soon, ranging from $2500-3500.
******************************************** hi brian-i don't think i am really qualified to answer any questions in this forum but will take a guess at the answer to this one simply because no one else has replied.
i have a friend that purchased a 40d. he likes the fps but wishes he had purchased the 5d. if you have not used a 5d, perhaps you might borrow or rent one and see if it suits you.
you will have more fun.
memory card i can shoot away all day long and statistically speaking i will have a few great images; with film unless i had tons of cash i would have to plan my shots and make decisions on which to take.
in addition, the build quality of nikon cameras is legendary.
clients get nervous and models get bored and lose interest, you have to capture the moment or you'll lose the momentum.
it is also a good bit less expensive than the nikon d2xs.
it is much cheaper for canon to make a small sensor than a big sensor.
i would also, obviously, love their to be a price reduction, but that might be wishful thinking.
as a canon user with too much money sunk into the system to switch on a whim like the beginners without a good set of lenses or the moneyed elite who seem to switch weekly, i hope that nikon absolutely trounces canon with its new full frame d3 and its d300 cameras.
as for printing, guess what, i can print to slides from digital just as easy as printing on paper if i want to go wet.
it is a patient studio photographer's camera.
if you've pressed the playback button and are reviewing images, a quick touch of the shutter release readies the camera to take pictures again.
it is my opinion that it is "cheating" to use some of the more advanced photoshop functions to manipulate your image because they allow you to create a "better" image than you originally captured.
in very practical terms, that is, a 600mm lens will give results in terms of image size comparable to 900mm lens when used on a sensor approximately 2/3 the length and width of a full frame sensor.
as a keen amateur for 25 years, i've owned a 5d for almost a year now and continue to be wowed by the results it yields, with, like any camera, a discerning eye, a sensitivity for the subject matter and a sense of imagination...
a recent review of a top photo printer (and by that i mean one costing over 500 pounds sterling, rather than in the 200 pounds sterling price range) by someone experienced in both digital and darkroom techniques, said that it produced the best prints he had ever seen, including those from a traditional darkroom.
i would not sell any of my images.
canon is a massive company with the $billions to invest in building semiconductor fabrication lines.
but somehow, after a few drinks that tasted wierd but have a tequila like effect, i figured that they have some kind of machines were i could use a plastic card to get money out of it.
in all it's been a hell of a workhorse camera for me, producing consistently high quality images even under adverse conditions.
robert ingram , may 11, 2007; 12:39 p.m. i just bought a canon 5d. apparently, the salesperson did not know what they were talking about, because he encouraged me to buy the canon 5d with the sigma dc 17-70 f/2.8 lens.
i would like to return to the days of full frame picutures and hence the 5d appeals, even if the "motor drive" is limited to 3 fps.
you may still be able to find the canon eos 5d, (compare prices), available from one of our partners.
add some fantastic filters (which digital users throw away now) and accessories and you will be taking phenominal pictures no matter what.
the difference is that you can shoot 5000 images in one day with out spending $7000 dollars on film and carrying around a 100 pound duffle bag full of film.
there are certainly a lot of good nikon cameras, as shown by the reviews at thislink for nikon products.
in the digital world, however, what you capture in the camera is what you'll be delivering in a jpeg file, unless you go into a photo editing program and take the trouble to crop.
i do like the fact that it does have the 35mm size sensors and that it is built so similar to the 30d. i have been price checking and find several hundred dollars variation in prices.
tom h , october 18, 2006; 09:59 a.m. evita it might be true that if you don't have an eye for shooting photographs a better camera will not change that.
i shoot glamour and getting those warm glowing skintones is paramount.
i've also lost a lot of digital files over the years, but i still have our old slides from the 1960's.
the 5d has the standard focus modes of any canon slr: manual, single-shot auto, continuous auto, and "ai focus" where the camera tries to figure out whether or not your subject is moving.
for my purposes, though, resolution and low light performance aren't huge issues, so my olympus e1 is actually better in other regards: much smaller and lighter, weatherproofed, and better lenses (in my price range).
i find myself now with amazing distortions (ellypses) and the canon pro services recently told me it was the "inconvenience" of full frame captors.
sensitivity is adjustable from iso 50-3200 but there is no good reminder of what you've got set and the setting is persistent if you turn the camera off and back on overnight.
i keep a small pocket-sized book with me with prints of my favorite photos.
in a year or two, of course, it will be just one more good camera.
(seemy photoshop directory for some useful scripts, including those that were used to generate the jpegs you see on this page.)
by the same token, i cannot afford any of the more upmarket canon full frame digitals.
i believe that you have to approach digital completely differently to film.
wow, we are in the early stages of digital photography, think how people will see early digital as oldskool and cool, a footprint of our current age.
i only shoot in digital and believe my photography is beauty which i have created and cherish the percentage of the shots which are excellent.
plus, you can take more...many more of them and print or save only the good photos.
the canon 17mm-40mm f4 lens works beautifuly with the 5d and if you want the f2.8 then try the canon 24mm-70mm pro lens.
it is also a good bit less expensive than the nikon d2xs.
it certainly depends on the person using the camera and i believe that you need to have the flare and artistic ability to be able to use any camera (including digital) to produce beautiful images.
also, compared to film the quality wasn't even close!
it may not make a lot of sense to anyone else, but i've found utility in blue-channel noise that most everyone else wants to disown.
it lacks a proper lcd display.
microdrives work in the camera, but operate very slowly if you are taking 14 mb raw images.
what about autofocus in 5d. i've heard lot complaints from those who used nikon d200 and switched to canon 5d. after this they appreciate af they used to have in nikon.
the 5d especially is excellent with wide angle and fish eye lenses.
as with all of the great canon eos bodies over the decades, if you drill down into the custom function menus, you can figure out how to make the autoexposure lock button on the back of the camera into a "burst of af" thumb switch while in manual focus mode.
looking back over this entire thread, it is astonishing how emotional people can get over film v. digital and canon v. nikon, etc.
i would like to return to the days of full frame picutures and hence the 5d appeals, even if the "motor drive" is limited to 3 fps.
there is no magnification with the smaller sensor cameras.
i can readily purchase a quality 40d, but to me that is not going forward.
an alternative is thecanon ef 24-105mm f/4 l is usm, (compare prices) (review), which has the advantages of light weight and image-stabilization at the cost of one f-stop in maximum aperture, which means that the viewfinder will be only half as bright.
i would say that if you have the money to spend on a canon 5d then definately try to get proffesional canon lenses.
i am waiting for the 5d mkii, and keeping my finger crossed that canon with stay with 12mp to keep the single pixel size of 8.2um of the 5d, and come up with a quality lcd such as that found on the new nikons, dust removal (5d is a dust magnet) and liveview functions.
a good photograph on a slide is still better resolution than most digital cameras (perhaps all), but if you scan it - you're re-sampling data, and that will cost you, and you might be better off with having taken the original with a digital camera.
i enjoyed making prints in my dark room i did pr, weddings, events, sports, newspaper work, portraits and even printed some in a couple of other peoples books.
this sounds great and indeed would be great on a film camera where slide mounts and cropping during enlargement often result in the sacrifice of some of the image at the edges.
if you are on the street and would like a dependable camera that understands you...go nikon.
software canon includes some image library management software with the eos 5d, including the zoom browser ex.
for taking pictures of sporting events without breaking your arm, you'll want acanon ef 300mm f/4l is usm, (compare prices) (review).
at the 10k range, the benefit of mf is obvious, the single pixel size (pitch) is much larger (8.4um) than the 1ds mkiii's 6.4um.
without some kind of linguistic shorthand here, we are going to have to teach basic physics every time we try to discuss lens selection--leaving the typical photographer with either glazed eyes or a dumbfounded expression.
a good photograph on a slide is still better resolution than most digital cameras (perhaps all), but if you scan it - you're re-sampling data, and that will cost you, and you might be better off with having taken the original with a digital camera.
i'll have to bring (perhaps even legally) that case to their marketting dpt as 3000 euros is quiet an investement, even for a professional.
without some kind of linguistic shorthand here, we are going to have to teach basic physics every time we try to discuss lens selection--leaving the typical photographer with either glazed eyes or a dumbfounded expression.
if you have $7000 to spend, a strong back to carry the weight, and a quick mind to take in the many displays and complex user interface, the eos 1ds mark ii might be better than the 5d. the canon eos 5d, however, will do most professional jobs.
any idiot can use a 7000 dollar digital camera.
shooting with film makes you think about so much more and makes you get a grip on things that digital will never teach you.
sometimes readers, in their emotion, do not read quite so carefully.
compared to nikon the full-frame canon eos 5d is cheaper than nikon's top-of-the-line small-sensor body.
my purpose buying it was to do architecture (50% of my assignements) with the 24 tse i already had on a eos 1n rs, amazing lens.
my 20d exposes backlighting perfectly and this camera costs over half as much of a 5d.
the light meter of both 5ds consistently underexposed when faced with backlit situations.
i keep a small pocket-sized book with me with prints of my favorite photos.
the picasa program from google also can understand the eos 5d's .cr2 raw files.
microdrives are also more prone to failure than the solid-state cf cards and i do not recommend them.
unfortunately, i'm in the middle of a job and now will have to rely on my 1d to finish it.
i am thinking about a 5d, but frankly i shoot wildlife on the wing that shows well and once in a while sells with the 6.3 i have.
i think all we have seen thus far in the dslr game is not even the entire opening, to use a chess term.
i have shot over 8000 images with my 5d now and evey single one has rivaled the quality of scanned negatives shot with my leica.
you are not asking the design engineers to overcome significant and difficult design compromises by desiging "one wide angle zoom that suits all" etc.
camera is just great, but for the tse system... http://www.jb-avril.com tony (anthony) rowell , july 08, 2006;
the canon eos 5d has an almost identical and equally simple user interface to the cheaper canon 20d and 30d bodies.
i suggest mr. greenspun do a little more research before making completely invalid statements which mislead camera buyers and uniformed photographers.
ok...for a photojournalist, a sport phtographer, a reporter like for a "common user" a digital vs. film question simply makes no sense.
any price that would fall more than, lets say, 20% or more out of that was proven to be a scam (in all cases).
this is a big step up from the 10d and 20d which i use for back up, but i agree that the industry is geting too pricy for consumer or semi pro photographers.
any advice you have for me would be greatly appreciated.
i will have to get him into a darkroom.
i just wish that one camera would do all i want, the closest is the 1d mk3.
heck, the pentax k10d trounces the 40d due solely to its in body anti shake.
to make a very long story short: both fuji and canon have their strengths, the canon with the right converter for raw (i prefer canons own one) can produce quite nice looking results, sharp, low noise etc.
i am aware that there appears to have been a batch of 5d's that had dust problems, but mine (luckly) was not one of them and when i did finally get somedust on the sensor (bad handling on my part), it was easy enough to clean w/o the need for a sensor cleaning kit or canon' service facility.
i use the 645 lenses on the 5d with a mirex adapter (shift comes in handy, since i do a lot of architecture).
i for one regret immensely never being schooled in film, however there is so much to learn in digital as well.
if you dislike digital for some of the reasons vincent or i have brought up you can still use a digital camera like a film camera and make a decision to not use advanced digital editing or decide to not simply hold the trigger down and take thousands of photos at a location to get a few good ones.
someone commented on how digital is almost catching film resolution or something.
i have not thrown away my watercolors or my 35 mm cameras etc., i have just added to what i enjoy.
patty larue , october 28, 2010; 10:20 a.m. i have the canon 5d and have been using with the 70-200 heavy lens for portrait work and weddings can someone please tell me what other lens to buy to replace this heavy lens for every day before i have to have surgery my neck can not take it.
if the 5d is a tough as my 30d i will be well pleased.
it is also interesting to look here if you want to get one indicator of relative market shares for the various companies, not just canon and nikon--and not just at the high end.
the canon speedlite 580ex ii flash, (compare prices) (review) is canon's current top of the line and it usefully covers an angle as wide as a 14mm lens.
if you are on the street and would like a dependable camera that understands you...go nikon.
a new lineup that is intended to attract a more... there are few industries as heart-wrenching as the fine art business.
i enjoy film and still purchase film equipment.
i have the 100mm f/2 just for that first instance, where 2 stops can make a big difference in stopping the motion of a galloping horse.
however have been used to 12mp files from the fuji, although it was an interpolated 12mp, and the fujis - both s2 and s3 - made nicer colors.
but i'm not sure i like spending the money for a lens that will only work on the 30d and not the 1d or my canon film bodies.
vincent martin , july 30, 2006; 05:01 a.m. i have read the above and there are a great variety of inputs and some poinient and timely infomrations.
a little over sampling and sharpening seems to make a very nice print at 13x19.
i agree it would be nice to have the price of canon l series drop.
they are very fast for dslrs.
i've got two extra batteries so i may bring them along, although i'm all but certain no one will let me take a photo to test the sensor.
this is a photo of pro photographers using predominantly eos systems at the olympics in 2004, a very demanding situation where "every moment counts" (your phrase).
there are few industries as heart-wrenching as the fine art business.
i don't really mind if their isn't a significant increase in resolution, but i would love to see the dust reduction system and the 3" lcd off the 1d mark iii.
be aware of online scams.
i found two shops that sell the 5d for $849 and the 400d for $339 which is incredibly cheap.
i just got everything in the mail today and i am experiencing major vignetting from this lens.
from where you stay it's normal to have perspective because the viewpoint where you are when taking that photo is lower not perfectly "perpendicular" and also in the middle of the buildyng (sorry my english, i'm not a native...)
some reviewers think that the 70-200mm f/4l is is a "better" lens (sharpness, etc) than the f/2.8l at the same apertures.
canon's quality control has diminished in my mind and i'm disappointed that all they would do was document my two cases of dust right out of the box.
i'm saying your argument sounds like someone that hates anything other than film and it just doesn't make any sense.
vertino machado david alpert , march 31, 2007; 11:31 p.m. the 5d is excellent in low light.
i think the true test of a photographer is attempting to take the same quality images with a film camera, as you can create using a digital camera with hours of photoshop work afterwards.
i'm very fond of wide lens photography and i wouldn't like to lose my cheap 19-35mm :).
(seemy photoshop directory for some useful scripts, including those that were used to generate the jpegs you see on this page.)
dynamic range while ok in the 5d is not as good as the s3 pro (and now the s5).
if you are a workhorse photographer, that is you are commercial, then you have things like time and money to worry about, and you need to find the best and most efficient and inexpensive tool for the job.
i do, however, use l lenses which i think more important than a couple of megapixels.
i had considered getting a 30d with the es-f 10-22mm zoom, which has been reported to be a great combination for landscape and architecture photography, but i'm not sure i like spending the money for a lens that will only work on the 30d and not the 1d or my canon film bodies.
tom moore , january 25, 2007; 08:35 p.m. i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever did with film.
the 70-200mm f/4l is a lot cheaper (the f/4l is is cheaper than the non-is f/2.8l) and a lot lighter (the f/4l is is about half the weight of the f/2.8l is).
ok...for a photojournalist, a sport phtographer, a reporter like for a "common user" a digital vs. film question simply makes no sense.
as for the 5d, yes, i believe that it has been worth the hype, in spite of its limitations in terms of speed.
arguing that shooting film is a more creative process than shooting digital is like saying writing a novel with a pen and ink is more creative than using a typewriter or computer.
both richer and more pleasing, and more "film like".
there is no magnification with the smaller sensor cameras.
though noisier than a point-and-shoot digital camera, the canon eos 5d is extremely quiet in operation, quieter than any modern film body and with a slightly more muted and lower frequency shutter "thunk" than the small sensor canon bodies.
and we all know that good home cooking is best, but sometimes a quick takeaway hits the spot as well.
it lacks a proper lcd display.
with the 50/1.4 lens: the 16-35/2.8l lens: the 24-70/2.8l lens (mostly from the robinson r44): one perceived problem with professional-grade cameras is that they can't be used by novices.
i've also lost a lot of digital files over the years, but i still have our old slides from the 1960's.
i have much more respect for a photographer who creates a wonderful sunset image with both the sky and foreground having a good balance of exposure than someone who merged two images together and created a high dynamic range image.
someone commented on how digital is almost catching film resolution or something.
i could buy the 1ds mark ii as a backup (kidding!).
with digital one has to be very precise and disciplined in order to not "overshoot" and make thousands of worthless crap pictures without any appeal and interest.
dedicated canon accessory flash units mount in the hot shoe above the viewfinder and the camera is able to control flash exposure via a through-the-lens sensor.
sensitivity is adjustable from iso 50-3200 but there is no good reminder of what you've got set and the setting is persistent if you turn the camera off and back on overnight.
the best professional solution isadobe photoshop cs2, which comes with an image editing tool called "adobe bridge".
however i know that doing a wedding or journalism is so much simpler with digital.
i have used a canon 1ds mark i and ii and i found the quality to be excellent.
it really is a great camera for what i do, mainly portraiture and some landscape.
one last thing, i found my 28-80 was not wide enough in some situations for weddings.
i have read that nikon produce better color and resolution and that many people are sold more on the amount of megapixles than anything else, please see the link below.
the d2xs is a superb camera, but don't have the large canon's sensor nor the tremendous s5 dynamic range.
85mm for portrait, 28 as wide angle, and selective dof/ unsharpness when i wish.
it may not make a lot of sense to anyone else, but i've found utility in blue-channel noise that most everyone else wants to disown.
maximum flash sync speed is 1/200th.
it is more than good enough for most professional photojournalism applications, but still simple enough that a yuppie can get one to throw in the glovebox of his bmw suv and take pictures at the school soccer game.
usm, (compare prices) (review), which is essential for day-to-day and low light photography, you will probably want the following standard professional zoom lenses: canon ef 16-35mm f/2.8l ii usm, (compare prices) canon ef 70-200 f/2.8l is ii usm, (compare prices)
i have to admit, however, that both the nikon d200 and the nikon d2x shoot more frames per second than the 5d.
some reviewers think that the 70-200mm f/4l is is a "better" lens (sharpness, etc) than the f/2.8l at the same apertures.
even a camera like the d40 has a much superior lcd than the 5d.tests say the nikon's vibration reduction system is better than canon's is system.
if so, i would prefer to get by with the quality small sensor 40d.
i have not thrown away my watercolors or my 35 mm cameras etc., i have just added to what i enjoy.
i make all kind of pictures, from sport to landscape and i am planning to buy the 40 d. however i am very tempted by the 5d. i have 3 lenses all l ones.
and traditional slides still have more of both, resoloution and contrast.
digital cameras and the digital workflow have made creating or capturing a great image much easier and much more likely for novice and amateur photographers (i admit i am one of these people however i have a "moral code" regarding the level of digital adjustments i will make).
the canon always looks to me like reduced, i guess it is the color palette, or the cmos sensors.
if you decide to go the photoshop/bridge route, you might find the dam
only canon builds dslr with full frame sensor right now.
after much review, i am purchasing the 5d. i think it will be a wonderful brush to paint with.
not enough people have the resources to set up a full b&w/color photo lab to be able to manipulate photo's on the required level of "fine art".
as for the 5d, i bought mine over a year ago and love it every second of the time i am using it, as well as looking at the finished work.
the 30d got jerked off a folding table and hit a concrete floor and bounced first on one corner, next on the lens shade, and finally on it's back.
well, i love the 5d camera, but to dismiss nikon as a small company with clever optical engineers is, well, way, way off.
my oldest son it taking a photography class, and i found out to my dismay, it is a digital photography class.
--lannie shane phil , july 19, 2007; 12:46 a.m. i have tried both canon and nikon systems, and here is my 2 cents worth: canon is an excellent system if you have the time and patience to play around with its settings, especially the iso which is not automatic.
usm, (compare prices) (review), which is essential for day-to-day and low light photography, you will probably want the following standard professional zoom lenses: mercifully, canon does not include a cheap zoom lens as part of a "kit" with the eos 5d.
the reason why you don't have perfect paralel lings there.
collect cans and shoot weddings with a popcan pinhole array!
i'm very fond of wide lens photography and i wouldn't like to lose my cheap 19-35mm :).
you are not asking the design engineers to overcome significant and difficult design compromises by desiging "one wide angle zoom that suits all" etc.
well, i love the 5d camera, but to dismiss nikon as a small company with clever optical engineers is, well, way, way off.
in a year or two, of course, it will be just one more good camera.
there is no color settings to adjust the lcd, you can only adjust the brightness levels.
i have done clay, batique as well as crayons.
as evita m put it so concisely, the real magic lies with the person taking the photograph.. and frequently, the luck of catching a passing moment as it happens.. whether a facial expression or the momentous interplay of light and landscape.
guido ersettigh (milan) , october 08, 2006; 05:45 p.m. claudia our friend knows well perspective theory in fact he used a lens that lets you basculate its axis in order to correct perspective distortion along one direction - optical bank lets you move, thanks to the bellow system, in any direction so you can correct distortion along any axis or put an whole item in focus even if it's not parallel to the lens -.
film kills digital, i know this.
microdrives work in the camera, but operate very slowly if you are taking 14 mb raw images.
to be perfectly honest, if you were a person that was extremely well versed in the digital tools, your ability to manipulate a photograph for artistic purposes is, and to "tweak" a photograph is so much greater than that if film.
i got two cheap lenses: the ordinary ef 28-90 and a voigtlander 19-35mm.
the 70-200mm f/4l is a lot cheaper (the f/4l is is cheaper than the non-is f/2.8l) and a lot lighter (the f/4l is is about half the weight of the f/2.8l is).
a.m. hi how do you leave the 5d on a tripod and use a self timer that lasts for atleast an hour and shoot continously.
you've successfully driven the price of a eos 3 down to a paltry $248.50 on ebay.
unfortunately, i'm in the middle of a job and now will have to rely on my 1d to finish it.
if you dislike digital for some of the reasons vincent or i have brought up you can still use a digital camera like a film camera and make a decision to not use advanced digital editing or decide to not simply hold the trigger down and take thousands of photos at a location to get a few good ones.
brandon boghosian , may 26, 2008; 10:55 p.m. alan, the same way hybrid's are killing the suv market.
of course, the resolution of the 5d is so high that you could pull out the central 8 mp of a canon eos 5d image and it would be almost as though you had taken the photo with a canon 30d or digital rebel.
i loved shooting in film for sooo long, but even the negs of the pictures i took are just sitting up in a box somewhere.
i also want to use my 50mm 1.4, especially for low-light photography, so the 5d is the only choice.
and i am fine with 3-5 fps, as i am, like most people out there, not a sport event shooter (5fps will do the job well, though).
now, though not being a maniac of the very latest gadget, the possibility of a new 5d version makes me slow down my upgrade...
the primary advantages of having a digital sensor the same size (24x36mm) as a frame of 35mm film are (1) higher image quality, especially in terms of noise and especially in lower light situations, and (2) the ability to use very wide angle lenses.
you may want to do what i'm going to do, buy it from a local retailer where you can inspect it first.
i perfectly understand all these older guys that shot film for years and years all of a sudden going, "wow i can do this with this new thing and it is like a million times easier."
i had considered getting a 30d with the es-f 10-22mm zoom, which has been reported to be a great combination for landscape and architecture photography,
put another away, using a 100mm lens is going to give you an effective focal length of [approximately] 150mm when used with the 10d, 20d, 30d, and digital rebel series.
although not the fastest camera for action shots, it is hardly "a patient studio photographer's camera," and no one who has used it would characterize it thus.
that is a bold statement, but having bought the very same printer myself and seeing the results from images taken with my 5d, i can understand his claim.
i've got two extra batteries so i may bring them along, although i'm all but certain no one will let me take a photo to test the sensor.
when i work i constantly use the histogram and i need to make snap judgments based on the lcd image and my exposure readings.
i will never miss the kodak 14n that it replaced, although i occasionally miss the aperture rings on my nikon lenses that i had to sell to be able to get both (1) full frame and (2) low noise at high iso.

film is more organic and like many examples of older technology it will always have its place and use and class (i have a fine omega mechanical wristwatch; sure it isn't as accurate as a quartz watch but it has class).
my purpose buying it was to do architecture (50% of my assignements) with the 24 tse i already had on a eos 1n rs, amazing lens.
even af from basic minolta worked better than mine.
it also allows me a greater amount of control over the in camera exposure settings and my results are getting better all the time.
i ended up using it like a (very expensive!)point and shoot.
without reading the manual, you can go into the custom function menu and the camera to lock up the mirror before taking a picture (then set self-timer mode on the drive button and the camera automatically configures itself for a 2-second self-timer delay; press the button and the mirror locks up, then the shutter opens two seconds later).
the light meter of both 5ds consistently underexposed when faced with backlit situations.
05:07 a.m. i have had my canon 5d for about 10 weeks now and i love it a superb camera,you can crop a small part of a file and the result is still very good,i also like the idea of changing the iso for each shot when i want to and i can do it just over a second with no bother at all,the only setting i use is the iso 50 setting for when i want to use it,some times i use the mirror setting so when you press the shutter release the mirror shoots up and went you press the shuter release again it will take the photo which is a good idea when taking macro shots as the mirror will not vibrate then !
(i flew the jet ranger helicopter on the left for three hours while commander chuck street reported the traffic and talked me through the occasional confined or pinnacle approach; i did not fly the helicopter on the right, which is a static display at the titan missile museum near tucson, arizona.)
i don't believe you can take a grainy image with digital.
i make all kind of pictures, from sport to landscape and i am planning to buy the 40 d. however i am very tempted by the 5d. i have 3 lenses all l ones.
digital allows photographers to experiment and create images with the camera in a way that is much too expensive for most people to do with film.
p.m. education bldg albany ny combining the 5d's high iso cleanliness + is provides hand held capabilities previously unheard of erwin baeyens , august 13, 2007; 10:54 a.m. frankly for being such a fantastic camera and for philip being an experienced photographer there are some seriously over exposed pictures on this review.
the only disadvantage to having a full-frame sensor compared to a small-sensor digital slr body (canon digital rebel or any nikon) is that the small-sensor effectively increases the magnification of telephoto lenses, which can be useful when you are doing sports or bird photography.
i went digital in 2001 on a trip to egypt to teach laboratory sciences and did not want to cart around several pounds of film together with all the other stuff i brought.
having taught photography back in the days when dinosaurs were just crawling out from the sea, i think 'wet' photography will be with us for a long time just as oil on canvas is still here.
a good camera without the right glass is useless too tom antonio (italy) , october 18, 2006; 05:49 p.m. i apologize for bad english grammar in my previous post... pedro p. polakoff iii , october 22, 2006; 03:24
i bought the digirebel (body only) 18 mos ago and this camera paid for itself immediately because i used to spend-at a minimum-at least $100 per month in film and developing.
autofocus performance is superb, even in dim light, with 15 af sensors distributed around the frame.
difficult to recreat with 35 mm, large format, or even digital cameras.
to recharge the battery you must carry a chunky travel charger that plugs directly into a wall socket.
the sensor plane is closer to the front of the camera with the smaller sensor cameras, nothing else.
if the rumors are true and canon is going to come out with a replacement to the 5d i might be interested in that as well.
a.m. hi how do you leave the 5d on a tripod and use a self timer that lasts for atleast an hour and shoot continously.
after seeing countless people come in with photos from a hell of a lot of different proffessional cameras, i would have to say that almost everything from the canon 5d has been the closest i have seen to film quality.
as for printing, guess what, i can print to slides from digital just as easy as printing on paper if i want to go wet.
it is maybe not a spectacular, but a very solid and high quality camera that can give very good files.
i've seen some great stuff from my students using pin-hole cameras.
so the 3 fps works well.
i ended up using it like a (very expensive!)point and shoot.
we have millions of average joe's with an $800 dslr that can produce great quality artistic photos.....and that will obviously blow the ego of anyone who's labored in a darkroom for any amount of time.
one nit: the 100mm f/2 is not the only alternative to the 70-200mm f/2.8l.
you lose image stabilization, but gain one f-stop in aperture so you can use higher shutter speeds and the viewfinder will be brighter.
the canon speedlite 580ex ii flash, (compare prices) (review) is canon's current top of the line and it usefully covers an angle as wide as a 14mm lens.
i had own my own photo business which i closed about the time i converted to digital in 2003.
i'm torn on buying the 5d. this dust thing seems to be an issue, vignetting due to light not falling evenly on full frame sensors(apparently a big problem for canon right now).
put another away, using a 100mm lens is going to give you an effective focal length of [approximately] 150mm when used with the 10d, 20d, 30d, and digital rebel series.
plus, you can take more...many more of them and print or save only the good photos.
i see the 5d more adequated for great prints with their big sensor allied with excelent characteristics.
dedicated canon accessory flash units mount in the hot shoe above the viewfinder and the camera is able to control flash exposure via a through-the-lens sensor.
just great for reportage, especially in low light situations.
i then went to a local camera store and had the sales person recreate a backlit situation in store with the same results.
but if you are smart and creative and artistic (and do not prefer to show this through computer illustration) but rather photography, shoot film.
i've read many posts regarding dust issues right out of the box.
i love the fact that the 5d has 12.8 megs of image boosting power but for difficult shoots i find myself using the 20d. i really think canon dropped the ball on this one.
a recent review of a top photo printer (and by that i mean one costing over 500 pounds sterling, rather than in the 200 pounds sterling price range) by someone experienced in both digital and darkroom techniques, said that it produced the best prints he had ever seen, including those from a traditional darkroom.
here are some things that would be nice for the next version of the 5d: reminder of what iso speed is set automatic iso mode smart enough to look at the shutter speed and whether or not the camera is sufficiently stable (i.e., tripod or not) and set the iso accordingly to avoid camera shake compared to the cheaper canon bodies can you get a dramatically better photo with the eos 5d and a canon 50/1.4 compared to what you'd get withcanon digital rebel xti (black) and sigma 30mm f/1.4
having recently found a great deal on a 16-35l,it seems clear that i should do the right thing and move from a rebel to a 5d(mkii still a little pricey) to get the full-impact of the glass.
in all it's been a hell of a workhorse camera for me, producing consistently high quality images even under adverse conditions.
george carter , december 16, 2006; 03:19 p.m. i bought my first dslr a canon 30d about 6 months ago and have been well pleased.
i just can't seem to get a saturated look on the lcd and it causes frustration during the shoot.
as for the 5d, i bought mine over a year ago and love it every second of the time i am using it, as well as looking at the finished work.
incredible photos, i have no more need for film.
you can't be going into the bride and groom's face to lock in an exposure reading.
i've seen some great stuff from my students using pin-hole cameras.
i found it very relaxing.
had i not invested a good number of canon l glasses, i would definitely go for mamiya or nikon d3.
it's status as 'last season's fashion' will help drive second hand
my 5ds had a defective light meter.
i am thinking about a 5d, but frankly i shoot wildlife on the wing that shows well and once in a while sells with the 6.3 i have.
thus you're able to manually adjust focus but have automatic assistance available when desired.
i found it very relaxing.
the sensor plane is closer to the front of the camera with the smaller sensor cameras, nothing else.
as a matter of fact, i print photos not posters most of the time.
i have so much control over my images, it scares me.
do not complain about high digicam prices.
i don't own many lenses - 10.5mm and the 18-70 that came with the d70.
a real photographer is the one who composes the shot perfectly and with their knowledge and technical ability will be able to capture a beautiful photo in 1 single shot rather than taking hundreds and finding the best one.
there is a diopter adjustment and you can change the focusing screen as well.
as a matter of fact, i print photos not posters most of the time.
i currently own a 20d and prior to purchasing it had actually never used a "real" film camera (don't laugh but the only camera i had used was a single use disposable film camera).
i found two shops that sell the 5d for $849 and the 400d for $339 which is incredibly cheap.
just great for reportage, especially in low light situations.
the canon always looks to me like reduced, i guess it is the color palette, or the cmos sensors.
though noisier than a point-and-shoot digital camera, the canon eos 5d is extremely quiet in operation, quieter than any modern film body and with a slightly more muted and lower frequency shutter "thunk" than the small sensor canon bodies.
let the camera rest for a few minutes and the battery voltage will come back.

the reason why you don't have perfect paralel lings there.
about the only reason i can see to ante up the extra money and haul around the added weight of the 70-200mm f/2.8l would be if one routinely takes action pictures in low light or if one is obsessively enamored of blurry backgrounds.
highlights can burn out much easier and in the shadows the transition from very dark to real black can be quite sudden.

jean-baptiste avril , may 23, 2006; 03:55 p.m. ellypses look at verticals at the right building bought an eos 5d two months ago.
the following images were taken at iso 800: batteries the included lith-ion battery is adequate for a day of active photography, somewhere between 300 and 500 photos plus review.
if you decide to go the photoshop/bridge route, you might find the dam book: digital asset management for photographers (peter krogh; o'reilly 2005) helpful.
being very uneducated on the 5d sensor, i went along with his request.
i use photoshop and shoot raw.
the creative process is not dependant on the tools.
when working with raw images, this is rather sluggish on all but the very newest and most powerful pcs.
but if you would like to present your pictures to your friends an family or any other larger group of people you do a slideshow.
but canon doesn't communicate at all on problems with this particular lens and generally says it efficient in all situations.
if you are a wide-angle junkie and have a bunch of older canon eos lenses designed for film cameras, you'll love having the eos 5d.
although i have never shot either, the specs on the nikon d200 and the nikon d2x are very, very impressive.
and the 50d with its big pixel count in a small crop sensor and the full frame 5d mk ii are both more capable in their noise reduction and in other ways.
the camera has an internal buffer memory for rapid sequence photography (17 raws or 60 jpegs).
in some respects, art is the way one interprets what one perceives and presents that interpretation so others can experience that expression.
nicholas eskey , april 03, 2008; 02:10 a.m. i was in ritz camera store today, looking to see if they still had canon 5d's in stock, since most of the camera stores in san diego seem to not, and i spoke with the counter guy about it.
for the most part i keep the original raw files and print the best of them.
shooting with film makes you think about so much more and makes you get a grip on things that digital will never teach you.
a little consideration more: the hasselblad h3d-22 (that's a heavy medium format bazooka) has a 4080x5440 square format sensor that produce a 22mpx file or, in print-size terms, a 13x18 print.
nikon is a small company with clever optical engineers.
it really is hard to find a true proffessional photographer.
after seeing countless people come in with photos from a hell of a lot of different proffessional cameras, i would have to say that almost everything from the canon 5d has been the closest i have seen to film quality.
so the only way to frame an image precisely is to take a test picture, look at the edges on the bright 2.5" rear lcd, and then recompose and click again.
it makes an image that goes into the computer nice n easy.
to make a very long story short: both fuji and canon have their strengths, the canon with the right converter for raw (i prefer canons own one) can produce quite nice looking results, sharp, low noise etc.
i'll bring both along with me and use 3 or 4 lenses interchangeably (along with a little lx3 for videos and stereo shots).
that is a rough rounded-off number and a rough way of getting the point across, but it works as very good shorthand in practice when deciding on a lens--and when writing reviews for a general audience.
sure, i could build a great vintage camera for much less money than a 5d, but i'd spend more on film, paper, chemicals and processing in 1 month than i would on a good digital camera.
looking back over this entire thread, it is astonishing how emotional people can get over film v. digital and canon v. nikon, etc.
i currently own a 20d and prior to purchasing it had actually never used a "real" film camera (don't laugh but the only camera i had used was a single use disposable film camera).
if so, i would prefer to get by with the quality small sensor 40d.
viewfinder coverage on the canon eos 5d is standard for an advanced amateur single-lens reflex camera, about 96 percent of what is recorded on the sensor is displayed in the viewfinder.
i think i will prbably not upgrade to the canon 5d mk ii as it is too expensive but will wait for the next eolution to appear.
so it is not so professional as pretended.
but much more important than resouloution is the amount of contrast that you can record.
the viewfinder image is substantially larger than on the small-sensor canon bodies.
brian cincotta , february 02, 2007; 04:58 p.m. tom, you made a comment and you said: "i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever did with film."
digital cameras and the digital workflow have made creating or capturing a great image much easier and much more likely for novice and amateur photographers (i admit i am one of these people however i have a "moral code" regarding the level of digital adjustments i will make).
would be quite happy using l series primes, only need to purchase 25mm l and that would complete my lens complement.
digital has mainstreamed the amount of people that can produce an amazing shot (by themselves, digital photography largely cuts out the middleman in mainstream film, ie.
i still have my old pentax and it is loaded, but i don't know when i'll find the time to take it off the shelf and finish the roll.
i am afraid that the answer is the first one, because canon don't say anything about it in the "specs", anouncing it proudly when they explain the advantages of the new brand eos-1ds mark iii.
i must say that the 5d's image quality is great.
so it is not so professional as pretended.
in digital, you have to master the craft of working with tools that are intangible, and exist in the realm of mathematics (1's, and 0's).
lol a bit of dust and air pollution is not enough to name mexico a measure parameter for camera resistance.
where to buy you may still be able to find the canon eos 5d, (compare prices), available from one of our partners.
digital camera like canon 5d takes terrific images and are extremely useful tool for the most common circumstances.
however, whilst there are many happy-snappers out there, who go from low resolution jpeg straight to printer, without so much as a mention of photoshop or the like, there are also photographers, amateur and professional, who are increasingly learning to understand and use the digital medium to great effect.
guido ersettigh (milan) , october 08, 2006; 05:45 p.m. claudia our friend knows well perspective theory in fact he used a lens that lets you basculate its axis in order to correct perspective distortion along one direction - optical bank lets you move, thanks to the bellow system, in any direction so you can correct distortion along any axis or put an whole item in focus even if it's not parallel to the lens -.
ok, i had no plans to shelv my pentax k1000, and even still had a desire to eventually convert an unused bathroom into a darkroom.
i'm torn on buying the 5d. this dust thing seems to be an issue, vignetting due to light not falling evenly on full frame sensors(apparently a big problem for canon right now).
after much review, i am purchasing the 5d. i think it will be a wonderful brush to paint with.
it has meant a huge learning curve for me.
the 13-megapixel canon eos 5d single-lens reflex digital camera is the first consumer-priced ($2700) full-frame sensor body.
digicams will all turn to dust but the film cameras of yesterday will be solid as a rock.
i have shot over 8000 images with my 5d now and evey single one has rivaled the quality of scanned negatives shot with my leica.
they are different mediums same as the way you would use either oils or water colours.
the 5d especially is excellent with wide angle and fish eye lenses.
i'll bring both along with me and use 3 or 4 lenses interchangeably (along with a little lx3 for videos and stereo shots).
if you're considering purchasing this camera from an online retailer, buyer beware.
mercifully, canon does not include a cheap zoom lens as part of a "kit" with the eos 5d.
by the same token, i cannot afford any of the more upmarket canon full frame digitals.
robert ingram , may 11, 2007; 12:39 p.m. i just bought a canon 5d. apparently, the salesperson did not know what they were talking about, because he encouraged me to buy the canon 5d with the sigma dc 17-70 f/2.8 lens.
i love the fact that the 5d has 12.8 megs of image boosting power but for difficult shoots i find myself using the 20d. i really think canon dropped the ball on this one.
autofocus performance is superb, even in dim light, with 15 af sensors distributed around the frame.
after 'restoring' them for presentation at my father's 90th birthday, i found i rather liked the feel of these vintage images and now find myself trying to make new images look old.
the primary advantages of having a digital sensor the same size (24x36mm) as a frame of 35mm film are (1) higher image quality, especially in terms of noise and especially in lower light situations, and (2) the ability to use very wide angle lenses.
a cheaper alternative but still good is the tamron range of lenses and they go down to f2.8 aswell for a fairly wide angled lens.
the 5d does not shoot at the blazing speeds of the newest canon dslr, but at present neither nikon nor anyone else has a digital camera with the kind of speed the 1d mark iii does.
that is a rough rounded-off number and a rough way of getting the point across, but it works as very good shorthand in practice when deciding on a lens--and when writing reviews for a general audience.
the small sensor canon bodies turn an exciting 20mm wide angle lens into a boring 30mm perspective.
" it's important to remember that even if you can scan something at a million dots per inch - you may just be fooling yourself.
i don't believe you can take a grainy image with digital.
asher . , april 14, 2007; 02:01 p.m. b&h, not amazon phil- not sure if pn has some backroom deal going with amazon, but by far the best mail order photography supplier isb&h photo: huge selection, iron-clad reputation, great prices, super fast shipping, and the best customer service i've ever experienced.
when you are deciding on which lens designed for 24 x 36 should be used with a camera having a sensor 2/3 the length and width of that, you can use the multiplicative inverse of 2/3, which is 1.5, and thereby compute what the effective focal length will be as it affects magnification, i.e., image size.
this sounds great and indeed would be great on a film camera where slide mounts and cropping during enlargement often result in the sacrifice of some of the image at the edges.
you can't keep adjusting your lights and changing your settings.
the canon eos 5d does not have a built-in flash.
the canon eos 5d cannot run on disposable aa batteries.
as a canon user with too much money sunk into the system to switch on a whim like the beginners without a good set of lenses or the moneyed elite who seem to switch weekly, i hope that nikon absolutely trounces canon with its new full frame d3 and its d300 cameras.
people throw away old computers just like they will throw away digital cameras.
i think the true test of a photographer is attempting to take the same quality images with a film camera, as you can create using a digital camera with hours of photoshop work afterwards.
but in order to do that you first have to downsize the pictures to match the beamer's resoloution, which is somewhat less than 1.75mp if it is bang up to date and hd-ready with 1080i.
it's just seems ironic to me that a $3000-2500 camera doesn't have a lcd screen as good as my $500 point and shoot.
search for prices for the camera i wanted.
it really is a great camera for what i do, mainly portraiture and some landscape.
i have not experienced any camera software problems or freezes.
these may be more expensive than the sigma but the point of having a 5d is so you can produce quality pictures, so go with the quality lens aswell!!
at the 10k range, the benefit of mf is obvious, the single pixel size (pitch) is much larger (8.4um) than the 1ds mkiii's 6.4um.
i think i will prbably not upgrade to the canon 5d mk ii as it is too expensive but will wait for the next eolution to appear.
arunas salkauskas , december 10, 2006; 02:09 a.m. "a 35mm slide scanned with a 4000dpi scan (like a coolscan 5000) gives to you a 3946x5782=22,8mpx file that you can print 13x18.
i use photoshop but only to do the most basic image adjustments such as cropping, resizing, adjusting levels and curves, etc.
if you do not create your art and have a bonafide craft in digital art (like making fantastic looking things painstakingly in photoshop or other based primarily on visions in your head), then you are basically putting your faith in those who decided how a certain color etc. should be rendered on a screen ie color spaces, color balance and the like.
i noticed the vingetting.
the only disadvantage to having a full-frame sensor compared to a small-sensor digital slr body (canon digital rebel or any nikon) is that the small-sensor effectively increases the magnification of telephoto lenses, which can be useful when you are doing sports or bird photography.
each camera had dust in the viewfinder and on the imaging sensor, the second body also had a problem (i thought) with the image numbering system, showing them as _mg_0001 rather than img_0001.
the 5d, on the other hand, is better in the following situations: you have a lot of older canon eos lenses that cast a full-frame image you love wide angle photography and want to have a good choice of wide angle lenses you want to take pictures in low light without a flash you think it is ridiculous to haul around a huge heavy lens designed to cover the 24x36mm frame of film and then only capture the central 15x22mm portion with a small sensor slr.

canon includes some image library management software with the eos 5d, including the zoom browser ex.
this is a photo of pro photographers using predominantly eos systems at the olympics in 2004, a very demanding situation where "every moment counts" (your phrase).
i only shoot in digital and believe my photography is beauty which i have created and cherish the percentage of the shots which are excellent.

now, though not being a maniac of the very latest gadget, the possibility of a new 5d version makes me slow down my upgrade...
as soon as you scan a negative to digital in order to make an enlargement, you are losing quality, no matter how good the scanner is.
its hard to find real photographers now as anyone with a fairly good digital is now branding themselves as pro photographers......
amazon... not so much- trying to be everything to everyone has negatively impacted their customer service.
kudos to the many moderate voices above and those that focus on the individual's artistic process above considerations of equipment and technology.
i think all we have seen thus far in the dslr game is not even the entire opening, to use a chess term.
quico álvarez , december 05, 2007; 06:03 a.m. hi, folks: i am professional, and like that it is not the same to spend $2,000 than $7,000, so i think that my choice should be the eos-5d. the only thing that stops me is not be able to know if this camera's a/d conversion is 12 or 14 bits.
in digital, you have to master the craft of working with tools that are intangible, and exist in the realm of mathematics (1's, and 0's).
" conclusion the canon eos 5d is the essential camera for everything that photographers used to do with 35mm film.
thus you're able to manually adjust focus but have automatic assistance available when desired.
it's always good to hear people getting good cameras for a good price.
check out thomas hawk's photos www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk which are never shot with a flash and he often shoots in very lowlight at iso 1600.
it's status as 'last season's fashion' will help drive second hand prices lower.
at least 3 of the first five pictures are having some exposure issues, and the first one is obviously the worst.
the small sensor canon bodies turn an exciting 20mm wide angle lens into a boring 30mm perspective.
difficult to recreat with 35 mm, large format, or even digital cameras.
brian cincotta , february 02, 2007; 04:58 p.m. tom, you made a comment and you said: "i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever did with film."
the remark is also extremely snobbish.
as evita m put it so concisely, the real magic lies with the person taking the photograph.. and frequently, the luck of catching a passing moment as it happens.. whether a facial expression or the momentous interplay of light and landscape.
that's pretty good market share for grandpa's camera brand!
the picasa program from google also can understand the eos 5d's .cr2 raw files.
in my humble opinion, it is not the equipment or the media it is the art, the composition, inspiration and good light that makes a good picture.
85mm for portrait, 28 as wide angle, and selective dof/ unsharpness when i wish.
joao pedro jorge , january 13, 2008; 02:36 p.m. i've been reading reviews on the 5d and the 40d because i'm thinking of buying a new camera.
the camera is always ready when you are.
canon still has a bit to learn from nikon in some areas.
digicams will all turn to dust but the film cameras of yesterday will be solid as a rock.
so, your max print size will be a great...9,4x14.
no, nikon cannot match canon's sensor technology;they are not the electronics giant that canon is.
nicholas eskey , april 03, 2008; 02:10 a.m. i was in ritz camera store today, looking to see if they still had canon 5d's in stock, since most of the camera stores in san diego seem to not, and i spoke with the counter guy about it.
as for the 5d, yes, i believe that it has been worth the hype, in spite of its limitations in terms of speed.
so, i hope he really did have the inside info, and that a canon "5d ii" is on the way.
if you are a wide-angle junkie and have a bunch of older canon eos lenses designed for film cameras, you'll love having the eos 5d.
i've done both, and personally, digital allows me sooo much more access to my photos.
i'm no big fan of nikon, i just like the cameras they make.
amazon... not so much- trying to be everything to everyone has negatively impacted their customer service.
crop and zoom are clear and sharp.
whatever lens you get, you will be able to shoot at the correct focal length as opposed to the previous models (20d, 30d etc) which were x1.6 or thereabouts.
my oldest son it taking a photography class, and i found out to my dismay, it is a digital photography class.
i have to admit, however, that both the nikon d200 and the nikon d2x shoot more frames per second than the 5d.
to recharge the battery you must carry a chunky travel charger that plugs directly into a wall socket.
eye relief is just barely adequate for people wearing eyeglasses.
when working with raw images, this is rather sluggish on all but the very newest and most powerful pcs.
too bad even my photos are great with this camera.
whatever software you choose to use, you won't have to spend too much time post-processing due to the eos 5d's inclusion of a mercury switch to orient photos.
for my purposes, though, resolution and low light performance aren't huge issues, so my olympus e1 is actually better in other regards: much smaller and lighter, weatherproofed, and better lenses (in my price range).
if i decide to switch to canon now is the time since i don't have too much nikon equipment.
with digital one has to be very precise and disciplined in order to not "overshoot" and make thousands of worthless crap pictures without any appeal and interest.
now that we are at this point, give me a linhof super technika only it is an 8x10 and a mountain of 8x10 polaroid film and a processor.
a community of photographers search all of photo.net photo captions photo tags equipment store home > equipment > canon > eos 5d most popular lenses popular articles missing pages: white balance jon sienckiewicz offers a juiced-up user guide for creative people via his "missing pages" column on photo.net.
i think this is going to be my next birthday present, its just the weight & cost thats going to hurt - ouch.
digital is just someone's opinion, but i find it highly inflammatory for no reason at all.
canon's quality control has diminished in my mind and i'm disappointed that all they would do was document my two cases of dust right out of the box.
this is not a great idea when trying to shoot a wedding.
balancing flash and natural light is straightforward.
i won't perform any manipulations such as replacing colors or pasting other "non-original" images into the photoa.
reliability and durability i've had this eos 5d for nearly a year and it has survived a trip through mexico and being vibrated for two cross-country helicopter trips.
nikon's build quality and ergronomics are way ahead of canon's.
memory card i can shoot away all day long and statistically speaking i will have a few great images; with film unless i had tons of cash i would have to plan my shots and make decisions on which to take.
in my humble opinion, it is not the equipment or the media it is the art, the composition, inspiration and good light that makes a good picture.
i also enjoy digital photography and have been able to support my hobby by creating portraits for people through digital art.
yes, canon can do 14bit ad conversion, but if the pixel picks up only nosier data at first hand, more resolution in the ad stage simply won't help much - (amplifying the noise)?
if you take 100 pictures in quick succession, don't be alarmed when the "low battery" symbols flashes.
that's why 5d is such an amazing gear, will so is the nikon d3.
ofcourse the brand has no impact on the photos you make, and neither does it make you a better photographer than you are.
janice m , february 19, 2007; 01:29 a.m. brian's question: "i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever did with film."

it does just about everything that an $7000 eos 1ds body from 2004 did at about half the weight (2 lbs).
if you are rich and dumb, i would definitly suggest going digital.
i still have my old pentax and it is loaded, but i don't know when i'll find the time to take it off the shelf and finish the roll.
film is more organic and like many examples of older technology it will always have its place and use and class (i have a fine omega mechanical wristwatch; sure it isn't as accurate as a quartz watch but it has class).
i work mostly with available light so i have to have to make sure i buy a camera that is best for low lighting conditions - i shoot hotel interiors and exteriors as well as very high resolution virtual tours of cockpits.
if they have not explored film far enough, and do not require some huge size out of the ordinary output, they probably will not know what they are missing switching to digital.
the creative process is not dependant on the tools.
when i work i constantly use the histogram and i need to make snap judgments based on the lcd image and my exposure readings.
and traditional slides still have more of both, resoloution and contrast.
p.m. i have to agree totally with this review of the 5d. as one who has shot leica equipment for over 30 years, this was the system of choice for me when i decided to make the transition from my trusty leica r8's & leica lenses to the digital world of the 5d with ef-l lenses.
digital pictures are different but damn, some of them are of wonderful color and quality.
i don't see the interpolated finepix megapixels exceed the canon.
joao pedro jorge , january 13, 2008; 02:36 p.m. i've been reading reviews on the 5d and the 40d because i'm thinking of buying a new camera.
let the camera rest for a few minutes and the battery voltage will come back.
but if you are smart and creative and artistic (and do not prefer to show this through computer illustration) but rather photography, shoot film.
arunas salkauskas , december 10, 2006; 02:09 a.m. "a 35mm slide scanned with a 4000dpi scan (like a coolscan 5000) gives to you a 3946x5782=22,8mpx file that you can print 13x18.
you can't keep adjusting your lights and changing your settings.
i typically am not shooting high speed photography so the 3 fps works well.
if you take 100 pictures in quick succession, don't be alarmed when the "low battery" symbols flashes.
i will go digital when they make the first 1,000,000 dollar digital camera which will be 108mp mamiya ofcourse, and it will accept all my rb67 lenses and ektars.
at least 3 of the first five pictures are having some exposure issues, and the first one is obviously the worst.
would be quite happy using l series primes, only need to purchase 25mm l and that would complete my lens complement.
i gave a huge sigh of relief when finally getting a digital slr - i could skip a generation in the process of getting digital prints.
i would also, obviously, love their to be a price reduction, but that might be wishful thinking.
i shoot mostly landscapes, some architectural and event photography, so the full frame is desired.
if you're going to take a lot of portraits, e.g., of a baby, and don't want to endure the weight of the 70-200/2.8, consider a primecanon ef 100mm f/2 usm, (compare prices) (review).
i have been looking at the 5d as my primary and my 30d as my backup so i won't be losing time changing lenses.
either way, i have found the driving factor for great image quality is the glass, namely l-glass.
i don't see the interpolated finepix megapixels exceed the canon.
the noise just looks like a bad quality image to me it doesn't give the atmosphere or mood that film grain does.
it's the firlst camera with full frame from this category of cameras.
from where you stay it's normal to have perspective because the viewpoint where you are when taking that photo is lower not perfectly "perpendicular" and also in the middle of the buildyng (sorry my english, i'm not a native...)
i had two samples of this camera sent to me by b&h and canon broke my heart twice (actually 3 times!).
the following images were taken at iso 800: the included lith-ion battery is adequate for a day of active photography, somewhere between 300 and 500 photos plus review.
there are two control wheels so that you can adjust aperture and shutter speed simultaneously.
vincent martin , july 30, 2006; 05:01 a.m. i have read the above and there are a great variety of inputs and some poinient and timely infomrations.
a little consideration more: the hasselblad h3d-22 (that's a heavy medium format bazooka) has a 4080x5440 square format sensor that produce a 22mpx file or, in print-size terms, a 13x18 print.
the learning curve is real and no less valid than that of understanding film and darkroom techniques.
if they have not explored film far enough, and do not require some huge size out of the ordinary output, they probably will not know what they are missing switching to digital.
the difference between film and digital isn't that any rich moron can take great pictures with a $7000 camera (they can't).
add some fantastic filters (which digital users throw away now) and accessories and you will be taking phenominal pictures no matter what.
i want to be able to deliver to my client larger prints with little or no noise in shadow areas.
i don't know if the 3" lcd will fit onto the back though.
i am afraid that the answer is the first one, because canon don't say anything about it in the "specs", anouncing it proudly when they explain the advantages of the new brand eos-1ds mark iii.
not unless you want to blow up the image to poster size and then the 13 megapixels of the 5d will be dramatically sharper than the 8 megapixels of the rebel.
if he had not seen the problem, he would not have chosen his words so carefully.
of course, the resolution of the 5d is so high that you could pull out the central 8 mp of a canon eos 5d image and it would be almost as though you had taken the photo with a canon 30d or digital rebel.
but in order to do that you first have to downsize the pictures to match the beamer's resoloution, which is somewhat less than 1.75mp if it is bang up to date and hd-ready with 1080i.
also, compared to film the quality wasn't even close!
the canon eos 5d turns on almost instantly and has unmeasureable delays for taking pictures, displaying previews, and waking up once asleep.
in film, someone pains in a dark room for hours, using tangible tools that move and change light as its placed onto a print.
they are different mediums same as the way you would use either oils or water colours.
it really is hard to find a true proffessional photographer.
but nonetheless the 5d is still probably the most affordable full frame around.
in other words an image captured with the camera held vertically will appear on a computer screen in a vertical orientation.
zhero.net jonathan farmer , march 22, 2007; 01:31 p.m. can anyone give a honest opinion on how the 5d, d2xs and the finepix s5 compare with respect to image quality.
danny yee , december 30, 2006; 06:35 p.m. the one thing that really impressed me when i had a play with a friend's 5d was the viewfinder.
so, your max print size will be a great...9,4x14.
you cannot use those mediums in the same way yet you have what is called a 'painting' in the end.
i loved shooting in film for sooo long, but even the negs of the pictures i took are just sitting up in a box somewhere.
but somehow, after a few drinks that tasted wierd but have a tequila like effect, i figured that they have some kind of machines were i could use a plastic card to get money out of it.
i went digital in 2001 on a trip to egypt to teach laboratory sciences and did not want to cart around several pounds of film together with all the other stuff i brought.
featured merchants canon eos 5d 12.8 megapixel digital slr camera body with lens kit - 0.94"-4.13" vendor vendor rating availability price there are currently no sellers for this product.
if you need high frames per second, i would not recommend this camera.
you could be in the middle ages handing out 8x10 prints to spectators moments after the joust ended in a fatal impalement.
i have a quality range of l series glass and if i went down the full frame path, would purchase couple of wide angle primes.
wow, we are in the early stages of digital photography, think how people will see early digital as oldskool and cool, a footprint of our current age.
the best is the enemy of the good and is hard on the pandl.
you will also see who has thier work hanging in art galleries and museums, and all the true art publications.
nikon's build quality and ergronomics are way ahead of canon's.
if you're going to take a lot of portraits, e.g., of a baby, and don't want to endure the weight of the 70-200/2.8, consider a primecanon ef 100mm f/2 usm, (compare prices) (review).
both richer and more pleasing, and more "film like".
but i noticed right away when shooting some models with strobes, they looked like crap
aside from all my rambling though, the 5d is definately the best digital camera out there!
just google the name of the shop and reviews, like, in my case was: "bestpricecameras reviews" so, it seems that the cheapest 40d (not scam) price was around $1000 and the 5d around $2200.
there is a greenish hue to everything, which is unnerving when you are under the gun on a paid shoot.
you will also see who has thier work hanging in art galleries and museums, and all the true art publications.
images that would have been difficult to attain (or costly, using a pro lab) straight from camera to high street developer.
each camera had dust in the viewfinder and on the imaging sensor, the second body also had a problem (i thought) with the image numbering system, showing them as _mg_0001 rather than img_0001.
the best test really is to hand the camera to a novice and see what happens.
you could be in the middle ages handing out 8x10 prints to spectators moments after the joust ended in a fatal impalement.
it's the firlst camera with full frame from this category of cameras.
i really don't enjoy the digital darkroom.
operating speed the canon eos 5d turns on almost instantly and has unmeasureable delays for taking pictures, displaying previews, and waking up once asleep.
i also want to use my 50mm 1.4, especially for low-light photography, so the 5d is the only choice.
the richness and detail of his photos at 1600 are amazing.
a little over sampling and sharpening seems to make a very nice print at 13x19.
arguing that shooting film is a more creative process than shooting digital is like saying writing a novel with a pen and ink is more creative than using a typewriter or computer.
i'll be a die hard film fanatic as long as the good men and women at kodak keep cranking out the precious 35mms.
i.e., sports photographers might want to consider one of the eos 1d bodies specifically designed for their rapid-fire needs.
quico álvarez , december 06, 2007; 02:44 p.m. i found it: eos-5d is 12 bit per channel in color depth.
so i am in the same: will continue scanning till they get a product that won't be obsolete in less than five years.
it has meant a huge learning curve for me.
dynamic range while ok in the 5d is not as good as the s3 pro (and now the s5).
note that, as with most digital single lens reflex cameras, the 5d cannot provide you with a preview in the rear lcd because the sensor is occluded by the viewing mirror until you press the shutter release.
there are two control wheels so that you can adjust aperture and shutter speed simultaneously.
also i use the 24mm ts-e shift lens a lot for architecture, which would be impossible with any nikon or fuji camera.
i would guess that the photographer (myself included) can take way more pictures and cheaper than using film because digital pictures are all free until processed.
any price that would fall more than, lets say, 20% or more out of that was proven to be a scam (in all cases).
there are no "winners" just have fun with what you like, and stop putting others down just to satisfy your own egomania.
the daunting nature of the processes involved in film would explain (along with relative cost) the explosion of new digital users.
owning a 30d with satisfies me quite well, i must say that i miss the perspectives of the full frame, 5d is definitely the choice for me.
saying this though, your sigma lens should produce 17mm pictures without a problem.
the only thing that worked was when the salesman used spot metering on the subject's face by going up in his face to lock in the exposure.
find a extremely rare and sought after collectors film camera and outfit it with the outstanding rare and obscure sought after glass.
this is very useful for tripod and macro work.
i won't perform any manipulations such as replacing colors or pasting other "non-original" images into the photoa.
there are no "winners" just have fun with what you like, and stop putting others down just to satisfy your own egomania.
but nonetheless the 5d is still probably the most affordable full frame around.
because this is not a zoom lens, it has many fewer individual pieces of glass inside and therefore you'll get the highest possible contrast and image quality.
but if you would like to present your pictures to your friends an family or any other larger group of people you do a slideshow.
i'll have to bring (perhaps even legally) that case to their marketting dpt as 3000 euros is quiet an investement, even for a professional.
i have won awards in art shows with digital pictures taken with a canon d60 at 6.3 megapixels, printed on an i9900 printer at 13x19.
i'm no big fan of nikon, i just like the cameras they make.
this is particularly the case as i like to take a fair number of wide angle - generally 25mm ( in 35 mm slr speak) to 35mm.
having recently found a great deal on a 16-35l,it seems clear that i should do the right thing and move from a rebel to a 5d(mkii still a little pricey) to get the full-impact of the glass.
viewfinder viewfinder coverage on the canon eos 5d is standard for an advanced amateur single-lens reflex camera, about 96 percent of what is recorded on the sensor is displayed in the viewfinder.
janice m , february 19, 2007; 01:29 a.m. brian's question: "i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever did with film."
if you are a serious photographer, you will want to purchase and carry a backup bp-511a battery (the same battery that canon has used in the 20d and the gn point-and-shoot models).
highlights can burn out much easier and in the shadows the transition from very dark to real black can be quite sudden.
while i was impressed with the images, i'm disappointed that i'm returned the camera again.
the best professional solution isadobe photoshop cs2, which comes with an image editing tool called "adobe bridge".
i would say that if you have the money to spend on a canon 5d then definately try to get proffesional canon lenses.
tom h , october 18, 2006; 09:59 a.m. evita it might be true that if you don't have an eye for shooting photographs a better camera will not change that.
i took it to canon factory service and they said there was nothing they could do.
although the d70 would make a great backup camera.
(the actual conversion factor is going to be about 1.6 for the canon small sensors, and about 1.5 for the nikon sensors, but 1.5 is close enough to be useful in practice for all of them.)
i got two cheap lenses: the ordinary ef 28-90 and a voigtlander 19-35mm.
also i use the 24mm ts-e shift lens a lot for architecture, which would be impossible with any nikon or fuji camera.
that difference really shows now that the making of cameras has come down to "how much can you invest in silicon chips?" the canon eos 5d is the essential camera for everything that photographers used to do with 35mm film.
but then i got so many projects going using the "dry" darkroom in my computer.
you lose image stabilization, but gain one f-stop in aperture so you can use higher shutter speeds and the viewfinder will be brighter.
if i decide to switch to canon now is the time since i don't have too much nikon equipment.
weather proofing, d o f button on the left(i hate it here, total pain to use with your thumb) i just wish that one camera would do all i want, the closest is the 1d mk3.
10:54 a.m. frankly for being such a fantastic camera and for philip being an experienced photographer there are some seriously over exposed pictures on this review.
i use photoshop but only to do the most basic image adjustments such as cropping, resizing, adjusting levels and curves, etc.
my comments have no impact whatsoever on the market image of either canon or nikon.
it is much cheaper for canon to make a small sensor than a big sensor.
there is no color settings to adjust the lcd, you can only adjust the brightness levels.
all in all, the 5d has made me shoot things i would never have shot without it.
maximum flash sync speed is 1/200th.
the daunting nature of the processes involved in film would explain (along with relative cost) the explosion of new digital users.
i have won awards in art shows with digital pictures taken with a canon d60 at 6.3 megapixels, printed on an i9900 printer at 13x19.
ok sure and when i whip out the 11x14 empire state and make selinium oxide silver contact prints (or whatever they are called) you will see who has cooler pictures.
i loved the slide films in the studio.
similarly, if we assert that digital photographers are somehow disadvantaged by having to contend with the colour space interpretations of a third-party, while not mentioning the colour bias traditionally imparted by different makes of film, it seems nonsensical.
i use the 645 lenses on the 5d with a mirex adapter (shift comes in handy, since i do a lot of architecture).
if the 5d is a tough as my 30d i will be well pleased.
the difference between film and digital isn't that any rich moron can take great pictures with a $7000 camera (they can't).
i already own a sigma 10-20mm and a nikon 18-200mm for this job.
this is a big step up from the 10d and 20d which i use for back up, but i agree that the industry is geting too pricy for consumer or semi pro photographers.
the common error that philip greenspun's review push forward is thinking that digital camera is the best solution for all or, in another formulation, that digital camera are simply better than film ones.
flash system is average.
george carter , december 16, 2006; 03:19 p.m. i bought my first dslr a canon 30d about 6 months ago and have been well pleased.
but i think film camera are still useful today.
i gave a huge sigh of relief when finally getting a digital slr - i could skip a generation in the process of getting digital prints.
do not complain about high digicam prices.
i never considered film photographers artistic because all one was doing was pushing a button.
digital allows photographers to experiment and create images with the camera in a way that is much too expensive for most people to do with film.
a 35mm slide scanned with a 4000dpi scan (like a coolscan 5000) gives to you a 3946x5782=22,8mpx file that you can print 13x18.
the eos 5d is not designed for use in a continuous downpour or very dusty environment like the canon eos 1ds mark ii, though it is a basically rugged and well-sealed design.
i do like the fact that it does have the 35mm size sensors and that it is built so similar to the 30d. i have been price checking and find several hundred dollars variation in prices.
when i got my 5d things changed, there are no 'cheat' modes on this camera, you actually have to know what you are doing.
you've successfully driven the price of a eos 3 down to a paltry $248.50 on ebay.
i rather, uh, suspect that phil g. is aware of the crop factor if an idiot such as myself is, and that is why he was very careful to insert the word "effectively."
microdrives are also more prone to failure than the solid-state cf cards and i do not recommend them.
you cannot use those mediums in the same way yet you have what is called a 'painting' in the end.
the difference is that you can shoot 5000 images in one day with out spending $7000 dollars on film and carrying around a 100 pound duffle bag full of film.
the camera can capture 3 frames per second continuously.
the noise just looks like a bad quality image to me it doesn't give the atmosphere or mood that film grain does.
i just can't seem to get a saturated look on the lcd and it causes frustration during the shoot.
being very uneducated on the 5d sensor, i went along with his request.
ok, i had no plans to shelv my pentax k1000, and even still had a desire to eventually convert an unused bathroom into a darkroom.
even a camera like the d40 has a much superior lcd than the 5d.tests say the nikon's vibration reduction system is better than canon's is system.
i am hoping to use a d2x and get the same quality but maybe the 5d will do well.
sometimes readers, in their emotion, do not read quite so carefully.
if you downloadmicrosoft raw image thumbnailer and viewer for windows xp, you can sort photos to some extent just using the standard windows file browser.
not unless you want to blow up the image to poster size and then the 13 megapixels of the 5d will be dramatically sharper than the 8 megapixels of the rebel.
four years old and still no dust in the viewfinder.
now that we are at this point, give me a linhof super technika only it is an 8x10 and a mountain of 8x10 polaroid film and a processor.
i already own a sigma 10-20mm and a nikon 18-200mm for this job.
any idiot can use a 7000 dollar digital camera.
in addition, the build quality of nikon cameras is legendary.
without reading the manual, you can go into the custom function menu and the camera to lock up the mirror before taking a picture (then set self-timer mode on the drive button and the camera automatically configures itself for a 2-second self-timer delay; press the button and the mirror locks up, then the shutter opens two seconds later).
one thing to note which i think is common to wide angle lenses, especially cheap lenses, is the light fall off or vignetting around the edges.
i am waiting for the 5d mkii, and keeping my finger crossed that canon with stay with 12mp to keep the single pixel size of 8.2um of the 5d, and come up with a quality lcd such as that found on the new nikons, dust removal (5d is a dust magnet) and liveview functions.
lol a bit of dust and air pollution is not enough to name mexico a measure parameter for camera resistance.
quico álvarez , december 05, 2007; 06:03 a.m. hi, folks: i am professional, and like that it is not the same to spend $2,000 than $7,000, so i think that my choice should be the eos-5d. the only thing that stops me is not be able to know if this camera's a/d conversion is 12 or 14 bits.
heck, the pentax k10d trounces the 40d due solely to its in body anti shake.
but then i got so many projects going using the "dry" darkroom in my computer.
it is still a great camera but showing its age with only a 4.1 mp imaging sensor.
digital unlocks creative possibilities because you never have to worry about how many shots you have left (or how many you need to get the image you want).
a photographer has to be more skilled to use film than digital.
while i was impressed with the images, i'm disappointed that i'm returned the camera again.
in some respects, art is the way one interprets what one perceives and presents that interpretation so others can experience that expression.
with the 5d, what you got with your 20mm lens on the film camera is what you get with the 5d. the canon eos 5d is compact and plasticky, but solidly built.
similarly, if we assert that digital photographers are somehow disadvantaged by having to contend with the colour space interpretations of a third-party, while not mentioning the colour bias traditionally imparted by different makes of film, it seems nonsensical.
if the rumors are true and canon is going to come out with a replacement to the 5d i might be interested in that as well.
these may be more expensive than the sigma but the point of having a 5d is so you can produce quality pictures, so go with the quality lens aswell!!
but much more important than resouloution is the amount of contrast that you can record.
the underscore means the white space was changed from srgb to adobe rgb.
check out thomas hawk's photos www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk which are never shot with a flash and he often shoots in very lowlight at iso 1600.
you may want to do what i'm going to do, buy it from a local retailer where you can inspect it first.
there are certainly a lot of good nikon cameras, as shown by the reviews at thislink for nikon products.
not enough people have the resources to set up a full b&w/color photo lab to be able to manipulate photo's on the required level of "fine art".
there is a woman who does blurry monotypes from my digital wildlife photos and sells them for more than i can sell the originals.
i enjoy film and still purchase film equipment.
the viewfinder image is substantially larger than on the small-sensor canon bodies.
aside from all my rambling though, the 5d is definately the best digital camera out there!
i then went to a local camera store and had the sales person recreate a backlit situation in store with the same results.
if you do not create your art and have a bonafide craft in digital art (like making fantastic looking things painstakingly in photoshop or other based primarily on visions in your head), then you are basically putting your faith in those who decided how a certain color etc. should be rendered on a screen ie color spaces, color balance and the like.
compared to th 300d the 5d gives me quality prints close enough to film.
in all things artistic it is the message not the media which is important.
that is a bold statement, but having bought the very same printer myself and seeing the results from images taken with my 5d, i can understand his claim.
however have been used to 12mp files from the fuji, although it was an interpolated 12mp, and the fujis - both s2 and s3 - made nicer colors.
if you're considering purchasing this camera from an online retailer, buyer beware.
in very practical terms, that is, a 600mm lens will give results in terms of image size comparable to 900mm lens when used on a sensor approximately 2/3 the length and width of a full frame sensor.
xiaoyuan gu , november 28, 2007; 10:12 a.m. it is time for canon to throw the goodies of 1d mkiii and 40d to a 5d mkii, to seriously compete with the nikon d3.
i do notice that sales are going up and higher resolution, better colours, less distortion etc. is not the last reason for that :) and don't forget glass.
find a extremely rare and sought after collectors film camera and outfit it with the outstanding rare and obscure sought after glass.
the full-frame canon eos 5d is cheaper than nikon's top-of-the-line small-sensor body.
the canon 17mm-40mm f4 lens works beautifuly with the 5d and if you want the f2.8 then try the canon 24mm-70mm pro lens.
digital has made it too easy for anyone to get into photography (i'm not saying this is a bad thing!).
i shoot mostly landscapes, some architectural and event photography, so the full frame is desired.
and i am fine with 3-5 fps, as i am, like most people out there, not a sport event shooter (5fps will do the job well, though).
i suggest mr. greenspun do a little more research before making completely invalid statements which mislead camera buyers and uniformed photographers.
the 13-megapixel canon eos 5d single-lens reflex digital camera is the first consumer-priced ($2700) full-frame sensor body.
i just got everything in the mail today and i am experiencing major vignetting from this lens.
they hold thier value beautifully.
the d2xs is a superb camera, but don't have the large canon's sensor nor the tremendous s5 dynamic range.
and the 50d with its big pixel count in a small crop sensor and the full frame 5d mk ii are both more capable in their noise reduction and in other ways.
(the actual conversion factor is going to be about 1.6 for the canon small sensors, and about 1.5 for the nikon sensors, but 1.5 is close enough to be useful in practice for all of them.)
as with all of the great canon eos bodies over the decades, if you drill down into the custom function menus, you can figure out how to make the autoexposure lock button on the back of the camera into a "burst of af" thumb switch while in manual focus mode.
as soon as you scan a negative to digital in order to make an enlargement, you are losing quality, no matter how good the scanner is.
to be perfectly honest, if you were a person that was extremely well versed in the digital tools, your ability to manipulate a photograph for artistic purposes is, and to "tweak" a photograph is so much greater than that if film.
i have much more respect for a photographer who creates a wonderful sunset image with both the sky and foreground having a good balance of exposure than someone who merged two images together and created a high dynamic range image.
i rather, uh, suspect that phil g. is aware of the crop factor if an idiot such as myself is, and that is why he was very careful to insert the word "effectively."
so for many looking for a full frame caera a used 5d may well still be a good buy.
the only thing that worked was when the salesman used spot metering on the subject's face by going up in his face to lock in the exposure.
i had two samples of this camera sent to me by b&h and canon broke my heart twice (actually 3 times!).
canon's wide zooms are good, but very far from the level of the nikon.
(the guys you see on television might have the 600/4, but that comes in its own suitcase and costs more than a small kia sedan.)
i must say that the 5d's image quality is great.
i had own my own photo business which i closed about the time i converted to digital in 2003.
i'm in the market for a 5d and wouldn't mind waiting if i knew what the feature set would be.
i would guess that the photographer (myself included) can take way more pictures and cheaper than using film because digital pictures are all free until processed.
but i noticed right away when shooting some models with strobes, they looked like crap and i though my light meter was off.
compared to th 300d the 5d gives me quality prints close enough to film.
saying this though, your sigma lens should produce 17mm pictures without a problem.
i do not know about the engineering but i seem to get much better pictures in low light situations with the fullframe.
if you downloadmicrosoft raw image thumbnailer and viewer for windows xp, you can sort photos to some extent just using the standard windows file browser.
nikon is a small company with clever optical engineers.
i still can't get over that 5d viewfinder, though, and that's the one absolutely unavoidable drawback of four thirds - technology improvements and price/size economies mean the smaller sensors will just lag 35mm sensors by two or three years (in resolution and sensitivity), but there's no way with that imaging circle to get abigger viewfinder image than the e1's.
the eos 5d is not designed for use in a continuous downpour or very dusty environment like the canon eos 1ds mark ii, though it is a basically rugged and well-sealed design.
in the digital world, however, what you capture in the camera is what you'll be delivering in a jpeg file, unless you go into a photo editing program and take the trouble to crop.

i have a quality range of l series glass and if i went down the full frame path, would purchase couple of wide angle primes.
i bought the digirebel (body only) 18 mos ago and this camera paid for itself immediately because i used to spend-at a minimum-at least $100 per month in film and developing.
(the guys you see on television might have the 600/4, but that comes in its own suitcase and costs more than a small kia sedan.)
i see the 5d more adequated for great prints with their big sensor allied with excelent characteristics.
the 5d has a green "idiot mode" on the left control dial.
if you've pressed the playback button and are reviewing images, a quick touch of the shutter release readies the camera to take pictures again.
an alternative is thecanon ef 24-105mm f/4 l is usm, (compare prices) (review), which has the advantages of light weight and image-stabilization at the cost of one f-stop in maximum aperture, which means that the viewfinder will be only half as bright.
the lcd is saturated and colors pop.
personally i dislike taking hundreds of shots to get a few good ones and take my time to capture a great photo.
the 5d has a green "idiot mode" on the left control dial.
canon still has a bit to learn from nikon in some areas.
compared to the more expensive canon bodies if you have $7000 to spend, a strong back to carry the weight, and a quick mind to take in the many displays and complex user interface, the eos 1ds mark ii might be better than the 5d. the canon eos 5d, however, will do most professional jobs.
one thing to note which i think is common to wide angle lenses, especially cheap lenses, is the light fall off or vignetting around the edges.
unfortunately that particular lens with 5d seems to produce an elliptical unexpected distortion.
i perfectly understand all these older guys that shot film for years and years all of a sudden going, "wow i can do this with this new thing and
i do notice that sales are going up and higher resolution, better colours, less distortion etc. is not the last reason for that :) and don't forget glass.
jeremey barrett , may 18, 2007; 12:22 a.m. robert (ingram), the sigma dc 17-70 is designed for aps-c sized sensors, not full frame sensors like the 5d. the salesperson should absolutely have known that and they should take it back, it simply won't produce usable images on the 5d (light is only going to fall on portion of the sensor).
my comments have no impact whatsoever on the market image of either canon or nikon.
in all things artistic it is the message not the media which is important.
ofcourse the brand has no impact on the photos you make, and neither does it make you a better photographer than you are.
if you need high frames per second, i would not recommend this camera.
tom moore , january 25, 2007; 08:35 p.m. i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever did with film.
not that it matters, but i think one would do better to search for 5d on the eos forum than to pay much attention to the comments here.
i also enjoy digital photography and have been able to support my hobby by creating portraits for people through digital art.
the 30d got jerked off a folding table and hit a concrete floor and bounced first on one corner, next on the lens shade, and finally on it's back.
p.m. straight from the camera, no photoshop except to sign & size it.
images that would have been difficult to attain (or costly, using a pro lab) straight from camera to high street developer.
i took it to canon factory service and they said there was nothing they could do.
controls canon's eos 5d has the standard four exposure modes: metered manual, aperture-priority, shutter-priority, and program autoexposure.
the 5d has the standard focus modes of any canon slr: manual, single-shot auto, continuous auto, and "ai focus" where the camera tries to figure out whether or not your subject is moving.
kudos to the many moderate voices above and those that focus on the individual's artistic process above considerations of equipment and technology.
a good camera without the right glass is useless too tom antonio (italy) , october 18, 2006; 05:49 p.m. i apologize for bad english grammar in my previous post... pedro p. polakoff iii , october 22, 2006; 03:24
i shoot glamour and getting those warm glowing skintones is paramount.
the richness and detail of his photos at 1600 are amazing.
personally i dislike taking hundreds of shots to get a few good ones and take my time to capture a great photo.
i work mostly with available light so i have to have to make sure i buy a camera that is best for low lighting conditions - i shoot hotel interiors and exteriors as well as very high resolution virtual tours of cockpits.
the common error that philip greenspun's review push forward is thinking that digital camera is the best solution for all or, in another formulation, that digital camera are simply better than film ones.
if you are a serious photographer, you will want to purchase and carry a backup bp-511a battery (the same battery that canon has used in the 20d and the gn point-and-shoot models).
it does just about everything that an $7000 eos 1ds body from 2004 did at about half the weight (2 lbs).
search for similar products on pricegrabber results by pricegrabber.com canon eos 5d 12.8 megapixel digital slr camera body only vendor vendor rating availability price
the canon eos 5d cannot run on disposable aa batteries.
i do not choose a camera based solely on market share, of course, but such data are not irrelevant to me.
this is particularly the case as i like to take a fair number of wide angle - generally 25mm ( in 35 mm slr speak) to 35mm.
i've read many posts regarding dust issues right out of the box.
photography in available, i.e., low, light is a pleasure with the canon eos 5d because the typical lenses that you'd use with this camera include the standard 50/1.4 from the film world.
asher . , april 14, 2007; 02:01 p.m.b&h, not amazon phil- not sure if pn has some backroom deal going with amazon, but by far the best mail order photography supplier isb&h photo: huge selection, iron-clad reputation, great prices, super fast shipping, and the best customer service i've ever experienced.
so the only way to frame an image precisely is to take a test picture, look at the edges on the bright 2.5" rear lcd, and then recompose and click again.
digital has mainstreamed the amount of people that can produce an amazing shot (by themselves, digital photography largely cuts out the middleman in mainstream film, ie.
i have covered a summarised review on my website: http://digital_camera_reviews.protechltd.com folarin s , february 05, 2009; 09:00 p.m. a new perspective as a new member on photo.net,i have to say that many of the above views relating to the respective merits of film vs. digital and full frame vs 1.6 crop factor have been tremendously helpful.
whatever lens you get, you will be able to shoot at the correct focal length as opposed to the previous models (20d, 30d etc) which were x1.6 or thereabouts.
i believe that you have to approach digital completely differently to film.
if you insist on having a wide-to-tele zoom, the standard choice is thecanon ef 24-70mm f/2.8l usm, (compare prices) (review ), which is useful for event photography such as wedding receptions.
it is still a great camera but showing its age with only a 4.1 mp imaging sensor.
however i know that doing a wedding or journalism is so much simpler with digital.
what about autofocus in 5d. i've heard lot complaints from those who used nikon d200 and switched to canon 5d. after this they appreciate af they used to have in nikon.
in film, someone pains in a dark room for hours, using tangible tools that move and change light as its placed onto a print.
all this competition is really going to benefit everybody here.
on the lcd skintones look washed out, the finally result on my laptop looked fine
i love the medium format slides in the glassed gepe frames.
i have read that nikon produce better color and resolution and that many people are sold more on the amount of megapixles than anything else, please see the link below.
had i not invested a good number of canon l glasses, i would definitely go for mamiya or nikon d3.
digital unlocks creative possibilities because you never have to worry about how many shots you have left (or how many you need to get the image you want).
only canon builds dslr with full frame sensor right now.
because this is not a zoom lens, it has many fewer individual pieces of glass inside and therefore you'll get the highest possible contrast and image quality.
i enjoy shooting with my elan7, as well as my canon 5d. i have noticed a big difference in image quality going from my xti to the 5d.
by that time i hope nikon will also be truly in te (full) frame and be producing a lower price competitor so that i can think aout returning to nikon.
for the most part i keep the original raw files and print the best of them.
the 5d does not shoot at the blazing speeds of the newest canon dslr, but at present neither nikon nor anyone else has a digital camera with the kind of speed the 1d mark iii does.
digital camera like canon 5d takes terrific images and are extremely useful tool for the most common circumstances.
i for one regret immensely never being schooled in film, however there is so much to learn in digital as well.
i have a friend that purchased a 40d. he likes the fps but wishes he had purchased the 5d. if you have not used a 5d, perhaps you might borrow or rent one and see if it suits you.
i enjoy shooting with my elan7, as well as my canon 5d. i have noticed a big difference in image quality going from my xti to the 5d. either way, i have found the driving factor for great image quality is the glass, namely l-glass.
i have the 100mm f/2 just for that first instance, where 2 stops can make a big difference in stopping the motion of a galloping horse.
so for many looking for a full frame caera a used 5d may well still be a good buy.
evita m , october 17, 2006; 03:42 a.m. "digital camera like canon 5d takes terrific images " i still think it's the one behind the lens who makes an image terrific or not, the camera itself, whatever camera, just makes a picture.
i really enjoyed being in the darkroom.
they are very fast for dslrs.
danny yee , december 30, 2006; 06:35 p.m. the one thing that really impressed me when i had a play with a friend's 5d was the viewfinder.
if he had not seen the problem, he would not have chosen his words so carefully.
i'm in the market for a 5d and wouldn't mind waiting if i knew what the feature set would be.
owning a 30d with satisfies me quite well, i must say that i miss the perspectives of the full frame, 5d is definitely the choice for me.

--lannie shane phil , july 19, 2007; 12:46 a.m. i have tried both canon and nikon systems, and here is my 2 cents worth: canon is an excellent system if you have the time and patience to play around with its settings, especially the iso which is not automatic.
it also allows me a greater amount of control over the in camera exposure settings and my results are getting better all the time.
a real photographer is the one who composes the shot perfectly and with their knowledge and technical ability will be able to capture a beautiful photo in 1 single shot rather than taking hundreds and finding the best one.
jeremey barrett , may 18, 2007; 12:22 a.m. robert (ingram), the sigma dc 17-70 is designed for aps-c sized sensors, not full frame sensors like the 5d. the salesperson should absolutely have known that and they should take it back, it simply won't produce usable images on the 5d (light is only going to fall on portion of the sensor).
the best test really is to hand the camera to a novice and see what happens.
