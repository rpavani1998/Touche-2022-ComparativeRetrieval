looking back over this entire thread, it is astonishing how emotional people can get over film v. digital and canon v. nikon, etc.
had i not invested a good number of canon l glasses, i would definitely go for mamiya or nikon d3.
film is more organic and like many examples of older technology it will always have its place and use and class (i have a fine omega mechanical wristwatch; sure it isn't as accurate as a quartz watch but it has class).
this is not a great idea when trying to shoot a wedding.
at the 10k range, the benefit of mf is obvious, the single pixel size (pitch) is much larger (8.4um) than the 1ds mkiii's 6.4um.
owning a 30d with satisfies me quite well, i must say that i miss the perspectives of the full frame, 5d is definitely the choice for me.
while i was impressed with the images, i'm disappointed that i'm returned the camera again.
i suggest mr. greenspun do a little more research before making completely invalid statements which mislead camera buyers and uniformed photographers.
for taking pictures of sporting events without breaking your arm, you'll want acanon ef 300mm f/4l is usm, (compare prices) (review).
it is much cheaper for canon to make a small sensor than a big sensor.
i am aware that there appears to have been a batch of 5d's that had dust problems, but mine (luckly) was not one of them and when i did finally get somedust on the sensor (bad handling on my part), it was easy enough to clean w/o the need for a sensor cleaning kit or canon' service facility.
my 20d exposes backlighting perfectly and this camera costs over half as much of a 5d.
i have covered a summarised review on my website: http://digital_camera_reviews.protechltd.com folarin s , february 05, 2009; 09:00 p.m. a new perspective as a new member on photo.net,i have to say that many of the above views relating to the respective merits of film vs. digital and full frame vs 1.6 crop factor have been tremendously helpful.
without some kind of linguistic shorthand here, we are going to have to teach basic physics every time we try to discuss lens selection--leaving the typical photographer with either glazed eyes or a dumbfounded expression.
arunas salkauskas , december 10, 2006; 02:09 a.m. "a 35mm slide scanned with a 4000dpi scan (like a coolscan 5000) gives to you a 3946x5782=22,8mpx file that you can print 13x18.
i do like the fact that it does have the 35mm size sensors and that it is built so similar to the 30d. i have been price checking and find several hundred dollars variation in prices.
i have to admit, however, that both the nikon d200 and the nikon d2x shoot more frames per second than the 5d.
it also allows me a greater amount of control over the in camera exposure settings and my results are getting better all the time.
of course, the resolution of the 5d is so high that you could pull out the central 8 mp of a canon eos 5d image and it would be almost as though you had taken the photo with a canon 30d or digital rebel.
you can't keep adjusting your lights and changing your settings.
i see the 5d more adequated for great prints with their big sensor allied with excelent characteristics.
i really don't enjoy the digital darkroom.
i found it very relaxing.
i am hoping to use a d2x and get the same quality but maybe the 5d will do well.
what about autofocus in 5d. i've heard lot complaints from those who used nikon d200 and switched to canon 5d. after this they appreciate af they used to have in nikon.
it does just about everything that an $7000 eos 1ds body from 2004 did at about half the weight (2 lbs).
i had two samples of this camera sent to me by b&h and canon broke my heart twice (actually 3 times!).
and traditional slides still have more of both, resoloution and contrast.
had i not invested a good number of canon l glasses, i would definitely go for mamiya or nikon d3.
by the same token, i cannot afford any of the more upmarket canon full frame digitals.
we have millions of average joe's with an $800 dslr that can produce great quality artistic photos.....and that will obviously blow the ego of anyone who's labored in a darkroom for any amount of time.
if the 5d is a tough as my 30d i will be well pleased.
i have used a canon 1ds mark i and ii and i found the quality to be excellent.
where to buy you may still be able to find the canon eos 5d, (compare prices), available from one of our partners.
you cannot use those mediums in the same way yet you have what is called a 'painting' in the end.
contributed content used with permission.
i agree it would be nice to have the price of canon l series drop.
p.m. straight from the camera, no photoshop except to sign & size it.
i will go digital when they make the first 1,000,000 dollar digital camera which will be 108mp mamiya ofcourse, and it will accept all my rb67 lenses and ektars.
i have a friend that purchased a 40d. he likes the fps but wishes he had purchased the 5d. if you have not used a 5d, perhaps you might borrow or rent one and see if it suits you.
having recently found a great deal on a 16-35l,it seems clear that i should do the right thing and move from a rebel to a 5d(mkii still a little pricey) to get the full-impact of the glass.
four years old and still no dust in the viewfinder.
the best test really is to hand the camera to a novice and see what happens.
to recharge the battery you must carry a chunky travel charger that plugs directly into a wall socket.
of course, the resolution of the 5d is so high that you could pull out the central 8 mp of a canon eos 5d image and it would be almost as though you had taken the photo with a canon 30d or digital rebel.
if the rumors are true and canon is going to come out with a replacement to the 5d i might be interested in that as well.
having taught photography back in the days when dinosaurs were just crawling out from the sea, i think 'wet' photography will be with us for a long time just as oil on canvas is still here.
so i am in the same: will continue scanning till they get a product that won't be obsolete in less than five years.
digital is just someone's opinion, but i find it highly inflammatory for no reason at all.
no dings, scratches, and best of all no internal damage to camera or lens.
if you're considering purchasing this camera from an online retailer, buyer beware.
thus you're able to manually adjust focus but have automatic assistance available when desired.
the only disadvantage to having a full-frame sensor compared to a small-sensor digital slr body (canon digital rebel or any nikon) is that the small-sensor effectively increases the magnification of telephoto lenses, which can be useful when you are doing sports or bird photography.
i loved the slide films in the studio.
i'll have to bring (perhaps even legally) that case to their marketting dpt as 3000 euros is quiet an investement, even for a professional.
nedine o'brien , february 27, 2007; 06:21 a.m. greetings all, i've only been studying photography for three years and started doing b&w film in a wet darkroom.
hi brian-i don't think i am really qualified to answer any questions in this forum but will take a guess at the answer to this one simply because no one else has replied.
any price that would fall more than, lets say, 20% or more out of that was proven to be a scam (in all cases).
having taught photography back in the days when dinosaurs were just crawling out from the sea, i think 'wet' photography will be with us for a long time just as oil on canvas is still here.
i think i will prbably not upgrade to the canon 5d mk ii as it is too expensive but will wait for the next eolution to appear.
that's why 5d is such an amazing gear, will so is the nikon d3.
only canon builds dslr with full frame sensor right now.
here are some things that would be nice for the next version of the 5d: reminder of what iso speed is set automatic iso mode smart enough to look at the shutter speed and whether or not the camera is sufficiently stable (i.e., tripod or not) and set the iso accordingly to avoid camera shake compared to the cheaper canon bodies can you get a dramatically better photo with the eos 5d and a canon 50/1.4 compared to what you'd get withcanon digital rebel xti (black) and sigma 30mm f/1.4
while i was impressed with the images, i'm disappointed that i'm returned the camera again.
flash system is average.
nicholas eskey , april 03, 2008; 02:10 a.m. i was in ritz camera store today, looking to see if they still had canon 5d's in stock, since most of the camera stores in san diego seem to not, and i spoke with the counter guy about it.
the 13-megapixel canon eos 5d single-lens reflex digital camera is the first consumer-priced ($2700) full-frame sensor body.
the underscore means the white space was changed from srgb to adobe rgb.
but i noticed right away when shooting some models with strobes, they looked like crap and i though my light meter was off.
i love the medium format slides in the glassed gepe frames.
as a canon user with too much money sunk into the system to switch on a whim like the beginners without a good set of lenses or the moneyed elite who seem to switch weekly, i hope that nikon absolutely trounces canon with its new full frame d3 and its d300 cameras.
if you do not create your art and have a bonafide craft in digital art (like making fantastic looking things painstakingly in photoshop or other based primarily on visions in your head), then you are basically putting your faith in those who decided how a certain color etc. should be rendered on a screen ie color spaces, color balance and the like.
05:07 a.m. i have had my canon 5d for about 10 weeks now and i love it a superb camera,you can crop a small part of a file and the result is still very good,i also like the idea of changing the iso for each shot when i want to and i can do it just over a second with no bother at all,the only setting i use is the iso 50 setting for when i want to use it,some times i use the mirror setting so when you press the shutter release the mirror shoots up and went you press the shuter release again it will take the photo which is a good idea when taking macro shots as the mirror will not vibrate then !
brandon boghosian , may 26, 2008; 10:55 p.m. alan, the same way hybrid's are killing the suv market.
ok sure and when i whip out the 11x14 empire state and make selinium oxide silver contact prints (or whatever they are called) you will see who has cooler pictures.
i noticed the vingetting.
a 35mm slide scanned with a 4000dpi scan (like a coolscan 5000) gives to you a 3946x5782=22,8mpx file that you can print 13x18.
the canon eos 5d has an almost identical and equally simple user interface to the cheaper canon 20d and 30d bodies.
note that, as with most digital single lens reflex cameras, the 5d cannot provide you with a preview in the rear lcd because the sensor is occluded by the viewing mirror until you press the shutter release.
even a camera like the d40 has a much superior lcd than the 5d.tests say the nikon's vibration reduction system is better than canon's is system.
p.m. combining the 5d's high iso cleanliness + is provides hand held capabilities previously unheard of erwin baeyens , august 13, 2007;
with the 50/1.4 lens: the 16-35/2.8l lens: the 24-70/2.8l lens (mostly from the robinson r44): one perceived problem with professional-grade cameras is that they can't be used by novices.
evita m , october 17, 2006; 03:42 a.m. "digital camera like canon 5d takes terrific images " i still think it's the one behind the lens who makes an image terrific or not, the camera itself, whatever camera, just makes a picture.
canon still has a bit to learn from nikon in some areas.
the d2xs is a superb camera, but don't have the large canon's sensor nor the tremendous s5 dynamic range.
when you are deciding on which lens designed for 24 x 36 should be used with a camera having a sensor 2/3 the length and width of that, you can use the multiplicative inverse of 2/3, which is 1.5, and thereby compute what the effective focal length will be as it affects magnification, i.e., image size.
one last thing, i found my 28-80 was not wide enough in some situations for weddings.
if you're going to take a lot of portraits, e.g., of a baby, and don't want to endure the weight of the 70-200/2.8, consider a primecanon ef 100mm f/2 usm, (compare prices) (review).
i still have my old pentax and it is loaded, but i don't know when i'll find the time to take it off the shelf and finish the roll.
but canon doesn't communicate at all on problems with this particular lens and generally says it efficient in all situations.
dedicated canon accessory flash units mount in the hot shoe above the viewfinder and the camera is able to control flash exposure via a through-the-lens sensor.
add some fantastic filters (which digital users throw away now) and accessories and you will be taking phenominal pictures no matter what.
you lose image stabilization, but gain one f-stop in aperture so you can use higher shutter speeds and the viewfinder will be brighter.
i will never miss the kodak 14n that it replaced, although i occasionally miss the aperture rings on my nikon lenses that i had to sell to be able to get both (1) full frame and (2) low noise at high iso.
after that i've found so many scams like that one that i recommend everyone doing the same before they buy their camera online.
i would not sell any of my images.
i am aware that there appears to have been a batch of 5d's that had dust problems, but mine (luckly) was not one of them and when i did finally get somedust on the sensor (bad handling on my part), it was easy enough to clean w/o the need for a sensor cleaning kit or canon' service facility.
it is also interesting to look here if you want to get one indicator of relative market shares for the various companies, not just canon and nikon--and not just at the high end.

i have done clay, batique as well as crayons.
reliability and durability i've had this eos 5d for nearly a year and it has survived a trip through mexico and being vibrated for two cross-country helicopter trips.
nikon is a small company with clever optical engineers.
(i flew the jet ranger helicopter on the left for three hours while commander chuck street reported the traffic and talked me through the occasional confined or pinnacle approach; i did not fly the helicopter on the right, which is a static display at the titan missile museum near tucson, arizona.)
saying this though, your sigma lens should produce 17mm pictures without a problem.
in other words an image captured with the camera held vertically will appear on a computer screen in a vertical orientation.
(the guys you see on television might have the 600/4, but that comes in its own suitcase and costs more than a small kia sedan.)
the 5d, on the other hand, is better in the following situations: the canon eos 5d has an almost identical and equally simple user interface to the cheaper canon 20d and 30d bodies.
i believe that you have to approach digital completely differently to film.
if you downloadmicrosoft raw image thumbnailer and viewer for windows xp, you can sort photos to some extent just using the standard windows file browser.
if you are rich and dumb, i would definitly suggest going digital.
that difference really shows now that the making of cameras has come down to "how much can you invest in silicon chips?" the canon eos 5d is the essential camera for everything that photographers used to do with 35mm film.
tom moore , january 25, 2007; 08:35 p.m. i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever did with film.
i still can't get over that 5d viewfinder, though, and that's the one absolutely unavoidable drawback of four thirds - technology improvements and price/size economies mean the smaller sensors will just lag 35mm sensors by two or three years (in resolution and sensitivity), but there's no way with that imaging circle to get abigger viewfinder image than the e1's.
in very practical terms, that is, a 600mm lens will give results in terms of image size comparable to 900mm lens when used on a sensor approximately 2/3 the length and width of a full frame sensor.
there is no color settings to adjust the lcd, you can only adjust the brightness levels.
i love the medium format slides in the glassed gepe frames.
i also want to use my 50mm 1.4, especially for low-light photography, so the 5d is the only choice.
by that time i hope nikon will also be truly in te (full) frame and be producing a lower price competitor so that i can think aout returning to nikon.
highlights can burn out much easier and in the shadows the transition from very dark to real black can be quite sudden.
but if you would like to present your pictures to your friends an family or any other larger group of people you do a slideshow.
there are few industries as heart-wrenching as the fine art business.
any idiot can use a 7000 dollar digital camera.
the best professional solution isadobe photoshop cs2, which comes with an image editing tool called "adobe bridge".
so the 3 fps works well.
i also want to use my 50mm 1.4, especially for low-light photography, so the 5d is the only choice.
the following images were taken at iso 800: batteries the included lith-ion battery is adequate for a day of active photography, somewhere between 300 and 500 photos plus review.
ok...for a photojournalist, a sport phtographer, a reporter like for a "common user" a digital vs. film question simply makes no sense.

this is a big step up from the 10d and 20d which i use for back up, but i agree that the industry is geting too pricy for consumer or semi pro photographers.
personally i dislike taking hundreds of shots to get a few good ones and take my time to capture a great photo.
in addition, the build quality of nikon cameras is legendary.
when i got my 5d things changed, there are no 'cheat' modes on this camera, you actually have to know what you are doing.
03:13 a.m. i started out with pen and ink, moved to pastels, charcoal, watercolor airbrushing.
guido ersettigh (milan) , october 08, 2006; 05:45 p.m. claudia our friend knows well perspective theory in fact he used a lens that lets you basculate its axis in order to correct perspective distortion along one direction - optical bank lets you move, thanks to the bellow system, in any direction so you can correct distortion along any axis or put an whole item in focus even if it's not parallel to the lens -.
i have much more respect for a photographer who creates a wonderful sunset image with both the sky and foreground having a good balance of exposure than someone who merged two images together and created a high dynamic range image.
a cheaper alternative but still good is the tamron range of lenses and they go down to f2.8 aswell for a fairly wide angled lens.
85mm for portrait, 28 as wide angle, and selective dof/ unsharpness when i wish.
xiaoyuan gu , november 28, 2007; 10:12 a.m. it is time for canon to throw the goodies of 1d mkiii and 40d to a 5d mkii, to seriously compete with the nikon d3.

vertino machado david alpert , march 31, 2007; 11:31 p.m. the 5d is excellent in low light.
i have not thrown away my watercolors or my 35 mm cameras etc., i have just added to what i enjoy.
and i am fine with 3-5 fps, as i am, like most people out there, not a sport event shooter (5fps will do the job well, though).
i still can't get over that 5d viewfinder, though, and that's the one absolutely unavoidable drawback of four thirds - technology improvements and price/size economies mean the smaller sensors will just lag 35mm sensors by two or three years (in resolution and sensitivity), but there's no way with that imaging circle to get abigger viewfinder image than the e1's.
if you need high frames per second, i would not recommend this camera.
not enough people have the resources to set up a full b&w/color photo lab to be able to manipulate photo's on the required level of "fine art".
i have not experienced any camera software problems or freezes.
maximum flash sync speed is 1/200th.
let the camera rest for a few minutes and the battery voltage will come back.
he said i should hold off buying it, because that the next upgrade to the 5d was going to be announced pretty soon, ranging from $2500-3500.
amazon... not so much- trying to be everything to everyone has negatively impacted their customer service.
it lacks a proper lcd display.
quico álvarez , december 06, 2007; 02:44 p.m. i found it: eos-5d is 12 bit per channel in color depth.
i've seen some great stuff from my students using pin-hole cameras.
whatever software you choose to use, you won't have to spend too much time post-processing due to the eos 5d's inclusion of a mercury switch to orient photos.

the light meter of both 5ds consistently underexposed when faced with backlit situations.
by that time i hope nikon will also be truly in te (full) frame and be producing a lower price competitor so that i can think aout returning to nikon.
no, nikon cannot match canon's sensor technology;they are not the electronics giant that canon is.
a recent review of a top photo printer (and by that i mean one costing over 500 pounds sterling, rather than in the 200 pounds sterling price range) by someone experienced in both digital and darkroom techniques, said that it produced the best prints he had ever seen, including those from a traditional darkroom.
the full-frame canon eos 5d is cheaper than nikon's top-of-the-line small-sensor body.
without reading the manual, you can go into the custom function menu and the camera to lock up the mirror before taking a picture (then set self-timer mode on the drive button and the camera automatically configures itself for a 2-second self-timer delay; press the button and the mirror locks up, then the shutter opens two seconds later).
the 30d got jerked off a folding table and hit a concrete floor and bounced first on one corner, next on the lens shade, and finally on it's back.
microdrives work in the camera, but operate very slowly if you are taking 14 mb raw images.
nikon's build quality and ergronomics are way ahead of canon's.
i am waiting for the 5d mkii, and keeping my finger crossed that canon with stay with 12mp to keep the single pixel size of 8.2um of the 5d, and come up with a quality lcd such as that found on the new nikons, dust removal (5d is a dust magnet) and liveview functions.
this is very useful for tripod and macro work.
the only thing that worked was when the salesman used spot metering on the subject's face by going up in his face to lock in the exposure.
but if you would like to present your pictures to your friends an family or any other larger group of people you do a slideshow.
i enjoyed making prints in my dark room i did pr, weddings, events, sports, newspaper work, portraits and even printed some in a couple of other peoples books.
the 70-200mm f/4l is a lot cheaper (the f/4l is is cheaper than the non-is f/2.8l) and a lot lighter (the f/4l is is about half the weight of the f/2.8l is).
although i have never shot either, the specs on the nikon d200 and the nikon d2x are very, very impressive.
the 5d has the standard focus modes of any canon slr: manual, single-shot auto, continuous auto, and "ai focus" where the camera tries to figure out whether or not your subject is moving.
although not the fastest camera for action shots, it is hardly "a patient studio photographer's camera," and no one who has used it would characterize it thus.
i've also lost a lot of digital files over the years, but i still have our old slides from the 1960's.

more and more people are going digital, thus driving down demand and prices for film gear.
if they have not explored film far enough, and do not require some huge size out of the ordinary output, they probably will not know what they are missing switching to digital.
it really is a great camera for what i do, mainly portraiture and some landscape.
it's status as 'last season's fashion' will help drive second hand prices lower.
alan cukurs , january 16, 2008; 01:01 a.m. get the 5d. if you like wide, the full frame will be a big benefit.
danny yee , december 30, 2006; 06:35 p.m. the one thing that really impressed me when i had a play with a friend's 5d was the viewfinder.
however have been used to 12mp files from the fuji, although it was an interpolated 12mp, and the fujis - both s2 and s3 - made nicer colors.
being very uneducated on the 5d sensor, i went along with his request.
available light photography in available, i.e., low, light is a pleasure with the canon eos 5d because the typical lenses that you'd use with this camera include the standard 50/1.4 from the film world.
i then went to a local camera store and had the sales person recreate a backlit situation in store with the same results.
you can't be going into the bride and groom's face to lock in an exposure reading.
its hard to find real photographers now as anyone with a fairly good digital is now branding themselves as pro photographers......
i love the fact that the 5d has 12.8 megs of image boosting power but for difficult shoots i find myself using the 20d. i really think canon dropped the ball on this one.
if you dislike digital for some of the reasons vincent or i have brought up you can still use a digital camera like a film camera and make a decision to not use advanced digital editing or decide to not simply hold the trigger down and take thousands of photos at a location to get a few good ones.

at least 3 of the first five pictures are having some exposure issues, and the first one is obviously the worst.
they're 13mpx, that's to say near the state of the art for a digital 35mm size-like camera.
i have been looking at the 5d as my primary and my 30d as my backup so i won't be losing time changing lenses.
let the camera rest for a few minutes and the battery voltage will come back.
yes, canon can do 14bit ad conversion, but if the pixel picks up only nosier data at first hand, more resolution in the ad stage simply won't help much - (amplifying the noise)?

the 5d especially is excellent with wide angle and fish eye lenses.
and the 50d with its big pixel count in a small crop sensor and the full frame 5d mk ii are both more capable in their noise reduction and in other ways.
the primary advantages of having a digital sensor the same size (24x36mm) as a frame of 35mm film are (1) higher image quality, especially in terms of noise and especially in lower light situations, and (2) the ability to use very wide angle lenses.
it has meant a huge learning curve for me.

a.m. hi how do you leave the 5d on a tripod and use a self timer that lasts for atleast an hour and shoot continously.
now, though not being a maniac of the very latest gadget, the possibility of a new 5d version makes me slow down my upgrade...
you may want to do what i'm going to do, buy it from a local retailer where you can inspect it first.
it also allows me a greater amount of control over the in camera exposure settings and my results are getting better all the time.
the camera is always ready when you are.
in digital, you have to master the craft of working with tools that are intangible, and exist in the realm of mathematics (1's, and 0's).
i work mostly with available light so i have to have to make sure i buy a camera that is best for low lighting conditions - i shoot hotel interiors and exteriors as well as very high resolution virtual tours of cockpits.
by the same token, i cannot afford any of the more upmarket canon full frame digitals.
i ended up using it like a (very expensive!)point and shoot.
85mm for portrait, 28 as wide angle, and selective dof/ unsharpness when i wish.
saying this though, your sigma lens should produce 17mm pictures without a problem.
there is no color settings to adjust the lcd, you can only adjust the brightness levels.
for the most part i keep the original raw files and print the best of them.
so the only way to frame an image precisely is to take a test picture, look at the edges on the bright 2.5" rear lcd, and then recompose and click again.
i went digital in 2001 on a trip to egypt to teach laboratory sciences and did not want to cart around several pounds of film together with all the other stuff i brought.
p.m. i have to agree totally with this review of the 5d. as one who has shot leica equipment for over 30 years, this was the system of choice for me when i decided to make the transition from my trusty leica r8's & leica lenses to the digital world of the 5d with ef-l lenses.
i'm saying your argument sounds like someone that hates anything other than film and it just doesn't make any sense.
flash the canon eos 5d does not have a built-in flash.
all in all, the 5d has made me shoot things i would never have shot without it.
i just got everything in the mail today and i am experiencing major vignetting from this lens.
my purpose buying it was to do architecture (50% of my assignements) with the 24 tse i already had on a eos 1n rs, amazing lens.
also, compared to film the quality wasn't even close!
if you insist on having a wide-to-tele zoom, the standard choice is thecanon ef 24-70mm f/2.8l usm, (compare prices) (review ), which is useful for event photography such as wedding receptions.
it really is hard to find a true proffessional photographer.
digicams will all turn to dust but the film cameras of yesterday will be solid as a rock.
my purpose buying it was to do architecture (50% of my assignements) with the 24 tse i already had on a eos 1n rs, amazing lens.
sometimes readers, in their emotion, do not read quite so carefully.
i'm torn on buying the 5d. this dust thing seems to be an issue, vignetting due to light not falling evenly on full frame sensors(apparently a big problem for canon right now).
although the d70 would make a great backup camera.
microdrives work in the camera, but operate very slowly if you are taking 14 mb raw images.
i would like to return to the days of full frame picutures and hence the 5d appeals, even if the "motor drive" is limited to 3 fps.
some reviewers think that the 70-200mm f/4l is is a "better" lens (sharpness, etc) than the f/2.8l at the same apertures.
the canon 17mm-40mm f4 lens works beautifuly with the 5d and if you want the f2.8 then try the canon 24mm-70mm pro lens.
the picasa program from google also can understand the eos 5d's .cr2 raw files.
that's pretty sad, considering what a tour de force of technology the 5d's sensor is.
quico álvarez , december 05, 2007; 06:03 a.m. hi, folks: i am professional, and like that it is not the same to spend $2,000 than $7,000, so i think that my choice should be the eos-5d. the only thing that stops me is not be able to know if this camera's a/d conversion is 12 or 14 bits.
a 35mm slide scanned with a 4000dpi scan (like a coolscan 5000) gives to you a 3946x5782=22,8mpx file that you can print 13x18.
the best is the enemy of the good and is hard on the pandl.
the picasa program from google also can understand the eos 5d's .cr2 raw files.
arunas salkauskas , december 10, 2006; 02:09 a.m. "a 35mm slide scanned with a 4000dpi scan (like a coolscan 5000) gives to you a 3946x5782=22,8mpx file that you can print 13x18.
because this is not a zoom lens, it has many fewer individual pieces of glass inside and therefore you'll get the highest possible contrast and image quality.
i would say that if you have the money to spend on a canon 5d then definately try to get proffesional canon lenses.
sensitivity is adjustable from iso 50-3200 but there is no good reminder of what you've got set and the setting is persistent if you turn the camera off and back on overnight.
i found it very relaxing.
there is no magnification with the smaller sensor cameras.
it is maybe not a spectacular, but a very solid and high quality camera that can give very good files.
the 5d has a green "idiot mode" on the left control dial.
in my humble opinion, it is not the equipment or the media it is the art, the composition, inspiration and good light that makes a good picture.
a little consideration more: the hasselblad h3d-22 (that's a heavy medium format bazooka) has a 4080x5440 square format sensor that produce a 22mpx file or, in print-size terms, a 13x18 print.
i would say that if you have the money to spend on a canon 5d then definately try to get proffesional canon lenses.
digital allows photographers to experiment and create images with the camera in a way that is much too expensive for most people to do with film.
ok, i had no plans to shelv my pentax k1000, and even still had a desire to eventually convert an unused bathroom into a darkroom.
the common error that philip greenspun's review push forward is thinking that digital camera is the best solution for all or, in another formulation, that digital camera are simply better than film ones.
just google the name of the shop and reviews, like, in my case was: "bestpricecameras reviews" so, it seems that the cheapest 40d (not scam) price was around $1000 and the 5d around $2200.
the daunting nature of the processes involved in film would explain (along with relative cost) the explosion of new digital users.
the canon speedlite 580ex ii flash, (compare prices) (review) is canon's current top of the line and it usefully covers an angle as wide as a 14mm lens.
canon's wide zooms are good, but very far from the level of the nikon.
an alternative is thecanon ef 24-105mm f/4 l is usm, (compare prices) (review), which has the advantages of light weight and image-stabilization at the cost of one f-stop in maximum aperture, which means that the viewfinder will be only half as bright.
that's why 5d is such an amazing gear, will so is the nikon d3.
if you are a wide-angle junkie and have a bunch of older canon eos lenses designed for film cameras, you'll love having the eos 5d.
the difference is that you can shoot 5000 images in one day with out spending $7000 dollars on film and carrying around a 100 pound duffle bag full of film.
there are certainly a lot of good nikon cameras, as shown by the reviews at thislink for nikon products.
digital unlocks creative possibilities because you never have to worry about how many shots you have left (or how many you need to get the image you want).
i do not choose a camera based solely on market share, of course, but such data are not irrelevant to me.
the creative process is not dependant on the tools.
the camera can capture 3 frames per second continuously.
for my purposes, though, resolution and low light performance aren't huge issues, so my olympus e1 is actually better in other regards: much smaller and lighter, weatherproofed, and better lenses (in my price range).
the light meter of both 5ds consistently underexposed when faced with backlit situations.
i see the 5d more adequated for great prints with their big sensor allied with excelent characteristics.
a new lineup that is intended to attract a more... there are few industries as heart-wrenching as the fine art business.
heck, the pentax k10d trounces the 40d due solely to its in body anti shake.
lol a bit of dust and air pollution is not enough to name mexico a measure parameter for camera resistance.
it is also a good bit less expensive than the nikon d2xs.
i don't own many lenses - 10.5mm and the 18-70 that came with the d70.
i had considered getting a 30d with the es-f 10-22mm zoom, which has been reported to be a great combination for landscape and architecture photography, but i'm not sure i like spending the money for a lens that will only work on the 30d and not the 1d or my canon film bodies.
i had considered getting a 30d with the es-f 10-22mm zoom, which has been reported to be a great combination for landscape and architecture photography,
looking back over this entire thread, it is astonishing how emotional people can get over film v. digital and canon v. nikon, etc.
you lose image stabilization, but gain one f-stop in aperture so you can use higher shutter speeds and the viewfinder will be brighter.
there are two control wheels so that you can adjust aperture and shutter speed simultaneously.
check out thomas hawk's photos www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk which are never shot with a flash and he often shoots in very lowlight at iso 1600.
i enjoyed making prints in my dark room i did pr, weddings, events, sports, newspaper work, portraits and even printed some in a couple of other peoples books.
the canon eos 5d cannot run on disposable aa batteries.
i have shot over 8000 images with my 5d now and evey single one has rivaled the quality of scanned negatives shot with my leica.
if i decide to switch to canon now is the time since i don't have too much nikon equipment.
find a extremely rare and sought after collectors film camera and outfit it with the outstanding rare and obscure sought after glass.
in a year or two, of course, it will be just one more good camera.
they are very fast for dslrs.
andrew klerck , may 12, 2007; 04:19 a.m. hey robert, well the 5d is a full frame sensor (like a film slr).
patty larue , october 28, 2010; 10:20 a.m. i have the canon 5d and have been using with the 70-200 heavy lens for portrait work and weddings can someone please tell me what other lens to buy to replace this heavy lens for every day before i have to have surgery my neck can not take it.
i have won awards in art shows with digital pictures taken with a canon d60 at 6.3 megapixels, printed on an i9900 printer at 13x19.
aside from all my rambling though, the 5d is definately the best digital camera out there!
if you decide to go the photoshop/bridge route, you might find the dam
i enjoy shooting with my elan7, as well as my canon 5d. i have noticed a big difference in image quality going from my xti to the 5d.
if you need high frames per second, i would not recommend this camera.
i've also lost a lot of digital files over the years, but i still have our old slides from the 1960's.
and we all know that good home cooking is best, but sometimes a quick takeaway hits the spot as well.
i could buy the 1ds mark ii as a backup (kidding!).
any price that would fall more than, lets say, 20% or more out of that was proven to be a scam (in all cases).
if so, i would prefer to get by with the quality small sensor 40d.
tom h , october 18, 2006; 09:59 a.m. evita it might be true that if you don't have an eye for shooting photographs a better camera will not change that.
the viewfinder image is substantially larger than on the small-sensor canon bodies.
i have found some really good deals on medium format cameras.
highlights can burn out much easier and in the shadows the transition from very dark to real black can be quite sudden.
i also enjoy digital photography and have been able to support my hobby by creating portraits for people through digital art.
viewfinder viewfinder coverage on the canon eos 5d is standard for an advanced amateur single-lens reflex camera, about 96 percent of what is recorded on the sensor is displayed in the viewfinder.
however have been used to 12mp files from the fuji, although it was an interpolated 12mp, and the fujis - both s2 and s3 - made nicer colors.
i'll be a die hard film fanatic as long as the good men and women at kodak keep cranking out the precious 35mms.
i'll be a die hard film fanatic as long as the good men and women at kodak keep cranking out the precious 35mms.
this is particularly the case as i like to take a fair number of wide angle - generally 25mm ( in 35 mm slr speak) to 35mm.
i would guess that the photographer (myself included) can take way more pictures and cheaper than using film because digital pictures are all free until processed.
robert ingram , may 11, 2007; 12:39 p.m. i just bought a canon 5d. apparently, the salesperson did not know what they were talking about, because he encouraged me to buy the canon 5d with the sigma dc 17-70 f/2.8 lens.
a real photographer is the one who composes the shot perfectly and with their knowledge and technical ability will be able to capture a beautiful photo in 1 single shot rather than taking hundreds and finding the best one.
it lacks a proper lcd display.
i don't see the interpolated finepix megapixels exceed the canon.
it is my opinion that it is "cheating" to use some of the more advanced photoshop functions to manipulate your image because they allow you to create a "better" image than you originally captured.
as a matter of fact, i print photos not posters most of the time.
to make a very long story short: both fuji and canon have their strengths, the canon with the right converter for raw (i prefer canons own one) can produce quite nice looking results, sharp, low noise etc.
i have a friend that purchased a 40d. he likes the fps but wishes he had purchased the 5d. if you have not used a 5d, perhaps you might borrow or rent one and see if it suits you.
if the rumors are true and canon is going to come out with a replacement to the 5d i might be interested in that as well.
not unless you want to blow up the image to poster size and then the 13 megapixels of the 5d will be dramatically sharper than the 8 megapixels of the rebel.
shooting with film makes you think about so much more and makes you get a grip on things that digital will never teach you.
my comments have no impact whatsoever on the market image of either canon or nikon.
they are different mediums same as the way you would use either oils or water colours.
there are no "winners" just have fun with what you like, and stop putting others down just to satisfy your own egomania.
but if you are smart and creative and artistic (and do not prefer to show this through computer illustration) but rather photography, shoot film.
any advice you have for me would be greatly appreciated.
it is also interesting to look here if you want to get one indicator of relative market shares for the various companies, not just canon and nikon--and not just at the high end.
in very practical terms, that is, a 600mm lens will give results in terms of image size comparable to 900mm lens when used on a sensor approximately 2/3 the length and width of a full frame sensor.
film is more organic and like many examples of older technology it will always have its place and use and class (i have a fine omega mechanical wristwatch; sure it isn't as accurate as a quartz watch but it has class).
the canon 17mm-40mm f4 lens works beautifuly with the 5d and if you want the f2.8 then try the canon 24mm-70mm pro lens.
not unless you want to blow up the image to poster size and then the 13 megapixels of the 5d will be dramatically sharper than the 8 megapixels of the rebel.
i never considered film photographers artistic because all one was doing was pushing a button.
too bad even my photos are great with this camera.
compared to nikon the full-frame canon eos 5d is cheaper than nikon's top-of-the-line small-sensor body.
brian cincotta , february 02, 2007; 04:58 p.m. tom, you made a comment and you said: "i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever did with film."
as for printing, guess what, i can print to slides from digital just as easy as printing on paper if i want to go wet.
unfortunately, i'm in the middle of a job and now will have to rely on my 1d to finish it.
put another away, using a 100mm lens is going to give you an effective focal length of [approximately] 150mm when used with the 10d, 20d, 30d, and digital rebel series.
i have a quality range of l series glass and if i went down the full frame path, would purchase couple of wide angle primes.
i perfectly understand all these older guys that shot film for years and years all of a sudden going, "wow i can do this with this new thing and
digital has mainstreamed the amount of people that can produce an amazing shot (by themselves, digital photography largely cuts out the middleman in mainstream film, ie.
the difference is that you can shoot 5000 images in one day with out spending $7000 dollars on film and carrying around a 100 pound duffle bag full of film.
i'm very fond of wide lens photography and i wouldn't like to lose my cheap 19-35mm :).
i would like to return to the days of full frame picutures and hence the 5d appeals, even if the "motor drive" is limited to 3 fps.
i do notice that sales are going up and higher resolution, better colours, less distortion etc. is not the last reason for that :) and don't forget glass.
--lannie shane phil , july 19, 2007; 12:46 a.m. i have tried both canon and nikon systems, and here is my 2 cents worth: canon is an excellent system if you have the time and patience to play around with its settings, especially the iso which is not automatic.
so, i hope he really did have the inside info, and that a canon "5d ii" is on the way.
i'm no big fan of nikon, i just like the cameras they make.
i perfectly understand all these older guys that shot film for years and years all of a sudden going, "wow i can do this with this new thing and it is like a million times easier."
in addition, the build quality of nikon cameras is legendary.
i don't really mind if their isn't a significant increase in resolution, but i would love to see the dust reduction system and the 3" lcd off the 1d mark iii.
owning a 30d with satisfies me quite well, i must say that i miss the perspectives of the full frame, 5d is definitely the choice for me.
if you insist on having a wide-to-tele zoom, the standard choice is thecanon ef 24-70mm f/2.8l usm, (compare prices) (review ), which is useful for event photography such as wedding receptions.
i do not know about the engineering but i seem to get much better pictures in low light situations with the fullframe.
i had own my own photo business which i closed about the time i converted to digital in 2003.
if you take 100 pictures in quick succession, don't be alarmed when the "low battery" symbols flashes.
the noise just looks like a bad quality image to me it doesn't give the atmosphere or mood that film grain does.
i found two shops that sell the 5d for $849 and the 400d for $339 which is incredibly cheap.
both richer and more pleasing, and more "film like".
clients get nervous and models get bored and lose interest, you have to capture the moment or you'll lose the momentum.
my oldest son it taking a photography class, and i found out to my dismay, it is a digital photography class.
compared to th 300d the 5d gives me quality prints close enough to film.
i loved shooting in film for sooo long, but even the negs of the pictures i took are just sitting up in a box somewhere.
if you are a wide-angle junkie and have a bunch of older canon eos lenses designed for film cameras, you'll love having the eos 5d.
so, your max print size will be a great...9,4x14.
i use photoshop and shoot raw.
plus, you can take more...many more of them and print or save only the good photos.
the canon always looks to me like reduced, i guess it is the color palette, or the cmos sensors.
either way, i have found the driving factor for great image quality is the glass, namely l-glass.
being very uneducated on the 5d sensor, i went along with his request.
but much more important than resouloution is the amount of contrast that you can record.
i have the 100mm f/2 just for that first instance, where 2 stops can make a big difference in stopping the motion of a galloping horse.
i enjoy film and still purchase film equipment.
a recent review of a top photo printer (and by that i mean one costing over 500 pounds sterling, rather than in the 200 pounds sterling price range) by someone experienced in both digital and darkroom techniques, said that it produced the best prints he had ever seen, including those from a traditional darkroom.
that is a rough rounded-off number and a rough way of getting the point across, but it works as very good shorthand in practice when deciding on a lens--and when writing reviews for a general audience.
as evita m put it so concisely, the real magic lies with the person taking the photograph.. and frequently, the luck of catching a passing moment as it happens.. whether a facial expression or the momentous interplay of light and landscape.
it is also a good bit less expensive than the nikon d2xs.
camera is just great, but for the tse system... http://www.jb-avril.com tony (anthony) rowell , july 08, 2006;
but then i got so many projects going using the "dry" darkroom in my computer.
i gave a huge sigh of relief when finally getting a digital slr - i could skip a generation in the process of getting digital prints.
they are different mediums same as the way you would use either oils or water colours.
i still have my old pentax and it is loaded, but i don't know when i'll find the time to take it off the shelf and finish the roll.
now that we are at this point, give me a linhof super technika only it is an 8x10 and a mountain of 8x10 polaroid film and a processor.
it certainly depends on the person using the camera and i believe that you need to have the flare and artistic ability to be able to use any camera (including digital) to produce beautiful images.
we have millions of average joe's with an $800 dslr that can produce great quality artistic photos.....and that will obviously blow the ego of anyone who's labored in a darkroom for any amount of time.
i for one regret immensely never being schooled in film, however there is so much to learn in digital as well.
without reading the manual, you can go into the custom function menu and the camera to lock up the mirror before taking a picture (then set self-timer mode on the drive button and the camera automatically configures itself for a 2-second self-timer delay; press the button and the mirror locks up, then the shutter opens two seconds later).
an alternative is thecanon ef 24-105mm f/4 l is usm, (compare prices) (review), which has the advantages of light weight and image-stabilization at the cost of one f-stop in maximum aperture, which means that the viewfinder will be only half as bright.
digital allows photographers to experiment and create images with the camera in a way that is much too expensive for most people to do with film.
not enough people have the resources to set up a full b&w/color photo lab to be able to manipulate photo's on the required level of "fine art".
it really is a great camera for what i do, mainly portraiture and some landscape.
i gave a huge sigh of relief when finally getting a digital slr - i could skip a generation in the process of getting digital prints.
however, whilst there are many happy-snappers out there, who go from low resolution jpeg straight to printer, without so much as a mention of photoshop or the like, there are also photographers, amateur and professional, who are increasingly learning to understand and use the digital medium to great effect.
(the actual conversion factor is going to be about 1.6 for the canon small sensors, and about 1.5 for the nikon sensors, but 1.5 is close enough to be useful in practice for all of them.)
all this competition is really going to benefit everybody here.
unfortunately that particular lens with 5d seems to produce an elliptical unexpected distortion.
someone commented on how digital is almost catching film resolution or something.
the small sensor canon bodies turn an exciting 20mm wide angle lens into a boring 30mm perspective.
if you dislike digital for some of the reasons vincent or i have brought up you can still use a digital camera like a film camera and make a decision to not use advanced digital editing or decide to not simply hold the trigger down and take thousands of photos at a location to get a few good ones.
there are certainly a lot of good nikon cameras, as shown by the reviews at thislink for nikon products.
i typically am not shooting high speed photography so the 3 fps works well.
03:13 a.m. i started out with pen and ink, moved to pastels, charcoal, watercolor airbrushing.
i can readily purchase a quality 40d, but to me that is not going forward.
but canon doesn't communicate at all on problems with this particular lens and generally says it efficient in all situations.
i shoot glamour and getting those warm glowing skintones is paramount.
i've done both, and personally, digital allows me sooo much more access to my photos.
i want to be able to deliver to my client larger prints with little or no noise in shadow areas.
as for the 5d, yes, i believe that it has been worth the hype, in spite of its limitations in terms of speed.
in film, someone pains in a dark room for hours, using tangible tools that move and change light as its placed onto a print.
quico álvarez , december 05, 2007; 06:03 a.m. hi, folks: i am professional, and like that it is not the same to spend $2,000 than $7,000, so i think that my choice should be the eos-5d. the only thing that stops me is not be able to know if this camera's a/d conversion is 12 or 14 bits.
there is a pc connector on the side for studio strobes.
i enjoy shooting with my elan7, as well as my canon 5d. i have noticed a big difference in image quality going from my xti to the 5d. either way, i have found the driving factor for great image quality is the glass, namely l-glass.
it does just about everything that an $7000 eos 1ds body from 2004 did at about half the weight (2 lbs).
canon is a massive company with the $billions to invest in building semiconductor fabrication lines.
weather proofing, d o f button on the left(i hate it here, total pain to use with your thumb) i just wish that one camera would do all i want, the closest is the 1d mk3.
so the only way to frame an image precisely is to take a test picture, look at the edges on the bright 2.5" rear lcd, and then recompose and click again.
after much review, i am purchasing the 5d. i think it will be a wonderful brush to paint with.
it's the firlst camera with full frame from this category of cameras.
the 70-200mm f/4l is a lot cheaper (the f/4l is is cheaper than the non-is f/2.8l) and a lot lighter (the f/4l is is about half the weight of the f/2.8l is).
i'm in the market for a 5d and wouldn't mind waiting if i knew what the feature set would be.
i think i will prbably not upgrade to the canon 5d mk ii as it is too expensive but will wait for the next eolution to appear.
it's just seems ironic to me that a $3000-2500 camera doesn't have a lcd screen as good as my $500 point and shoot.
i make all kind of pictures, from sport to landscape and i am planning to buy the 40 d. however i am very tempted by the 5d. i have 3 lenses all l ones.
images that would have been difficult to attain (or costly, using a pro lab) straight from camera to high street developer.
sure, i could build a great vintage camera for much less money than a 5d, but i'd spend more on film, paper, chemicals and processing in 1 month than i would on a good digital camera.
to be perfectly honest, if you were a person that was extremely well versed in the digital tools, your ability to manipulate a photograph for artistic purposes is, and to "tweak" a photograph is so much greater than that if film.
it is disappointing to see the lack of film photography being taught.
i want to be able to deliver to my client larger prints with little or no noise in shadow areas.
a good photograph on a slide is still better resolution than most digital cameras (perhaps all), but if you scan it - you're re-sampling data, and that will cost you, and you might be better off with having taken the original with a digital camera.
digital pictures are different but damn, some of them are of wonderful color and quality.
nikon is a versatile system if you are on the street and every moment counts.
and traditional slides still have more of both, resoloution and contrast.
i have come to really enjoy photogarphy as an artform.
at least 3 of the first five pictures are having some exposure issues, and the first one is obviously the worst.
whatever lens you get, you will be able to shoot at the correct focal length as opposed to the previous models (20d, 30d etc) which were x1.6 or thereabouts.
i only shoot in digital and believe my photography is beauty which i have created and cherish the percentage of the shots which are excellent.
" it's important to remember that even if you can scan something at a million dots per inch - you may just be fooling yourself.
a photographer has to be more skilled to use film than digital.
i have the 100mm f/2 just for that first instance, where 2 stops can make a big difference in stopping the motion of a galloping horse.
i have read that nikon produce better color and resolution and that many people are sold more on the amount of megapixles than anything else, please see the link below.
jean-baptiste avril , may 23, 2006; 03:55 p.m. ellypses look at verticals at the right building bought an eos 5d two months ago.
i had two samples of this camera sent to me by b&h and canon broke my heart twice (actually 3 times!).
contributed content used with permission.
the difference between film and digital isn't that any rich moron can take great pictures with a $7000 camera (they can't).
about the only reason i can see to ante up the extra money and haul around the added weight of the 70-200mm f/2.8l would be if one routinely takes action pictures in low light or if one is obsessively enamored of blurry backgrounds.
you've successfully driven the price of a eos 3 down to a paltry $248.50 on ebay.
but if you are smart and creative and artistic (and do not prefer to show this through computer illustration) but rather photography, shoot film.
i do, however, use l lenses which i think more important than a couple of megapixels.
the learning curve is real and no less valid than that of understanding film and darkroom techniques.
i am thinking about a 5d, but frankly i shoot wildlife on the wing that shows well and once in a while sells with the 6.3 i have.
add some fantastic filters (which digital users throw away now) and accessories and you will be taking phenominal pictures no matter what.
i just can't seem to get a saturated look on the lcd and it causes frustration during the shoot.
i just wish that one camera would do all i want, the closest is the 1d mk3.
i must say that the 5d's image quality is great.
if you've pressed the playback button and are reviewing images, a quick touch of the shutter release readies the camera to take pictures again.
that is a rough rounded-off number and a rough way of getting the point across, but it works as very good shorthand in practice when deciding on a lens--and when writing reviews for a general audience.
each camera had dust in the viewfinder and on the imaging sensor, the second body also had a problem (i thought) with the image numbering system, showing them as _mg_0001 rather than img_0001.
i've had this eos 5d for nearly a year and it has survived a trip through mexico and being vibrated for two cross-country helicopter trips.
i make all kind of pictures, from sport to landscape and i am planning to buy the 40 d. however i am very tempted by the 5d. i have 3 lenses all l ones.
i shoot mostly landscapes, some architectural and event photography, so the full frame is desired.
i'll have to bring (perhaps even legally) that case to their marketting dpt as 3000 euros is quiet an investement, even for a professional.
the viewfinder image is substantially larger than on the small-sensor canon bodies.

there is a greenish hue to everything, which is unnerving when you are under the gun on a paid shoot.
the small sensor canon bodies turn an exciting 20mm wide angle lens into a boring 30mm perspective.
but i'm not sure i like spending the money for a lens that will only work on the 30d and not the 1d or my canon film bodies.
i bought the digirebel (body only) 18 mos ago and this camera paid for itself immediately because i used to spend-at a minimum-at least $100 per month in film and developing.
in all it's been a hell of a workhorse camera for me, producing consistently high quality images even under adverse conditions.
i've seen some great stuff from my students using pin-hole cameras.
so, i hope he really did have the inside info, and that a canon "5d ii" is on the way.
you've successfully driven the price of a eos 3 down to a paltry $248.50 on ebay.
the best professional solution isadobe photoshop cs2, which comes with an image editing tool called "adobe bridge".
zhero.net jonathan farmer , march 22, 2007; 01:31 p.m. can anyone give a honest opinion on how the 5d, d2xs and the finepix s5 compare with respect to image quality.
photography in available, i.e., low, light is a pleasure with the canon eos 5d because the typical lenses that you'd use with this camera include the standard 50/1.4 from the film world.
i am afraid that the answer is the first one, because canon don't say anything about it in the "specs", anouncing it proudly when they explain the advantages of the new brand eos-1ds mark iii.
one thing to note which i think is common to wide angle lenses, especially cheap lenses, is the light fall off or vignetting around the edges.
someone commented on how digital is almost catching film resolution or something.
when you are deciding on which lens designed for 24 x 36 should be used with a camera having a sensor 2/3 the length and width of that, you can use the multiplicative inverse of 2/3, which is 1.5, and thereby compute what the effective focal length will be as it affects magnification, i.e., image size.
dedicated canon accessory flash units mount in the hot shoe above the viewfinder and the camera is able to control flash exposure via a through-the-lens sensor.
i do, however, use l lenses which i think more important than a couple of megapixels.
robert ingram , may 11, 2007; 12:39 p.m. i just bought a canon 5d. apparently, the salesperson did not know what they were talking about, because he encouraged me to buy the canon 5d with the sigma dc 17-70 f/2.8 lens.
if you decide to go the photoshop/bridge route, you might find the dam book: digital asset management for photographers (peter krogh; o'reilly 2005) helpful.
if you are a workhorse photographer, that is you are commercial, then you have things like time and money to worry about, and you need to find the best and most efficient and inexpensive tool for the job.
i shoot mostly landscapes, some architectural and event photography, so the full frame is desired.
i think the true test of a photographer is attempting to take the same quality images with a film camera, as you can create using a digital camera with hours of photoshop work afterwards.
i've got two extra batteries so i may bring them along, although i'm all but certain no one will let me take a photo to test the sensor.
also i use the 24mm ts-e shift lens a lot for architecture, which would be impossible with any nikon or fuji camera.
in all things artistic it is the message not the media which is important.
well, i love the 5d camera, but to dismiss nikon as a small company with clever optical engineers is, well, way, way off.
when i got my 5d things changed, there are no 'cheat' modes on this camera, you actually have to know what you are doing.
to be perfectly honest, if you were a person that was extremely well versed in the digital tools, your ability to manipulate a photograph for artistic purposes is, and to "tweak" a photograph is so much greater than that if film.
brian cincotta , february 02, 2007; 04:58 p.m. tom, you made a comment and you said: "i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever did with film."
but somehow, after a few drinks that tasted wierd but have a tequila like effect, i figured that they have some kind of machines were i could use a plastic card to get money out of it.
i don't really mind if their isn't a significant increase in resolution, but i would love to see the dust reduction system and the 3" lcd off the 1d mark iii.
in other words an image captured with the camera held vertically will appear on a computer screen in a vertical orientation.
in digital, you have to master the craft of working with tools that are intangible, and exist in the realm of mathematics (1's, and 0's).
this sounds great and indeed would be great on a film camera where slide mounts and cropping during enlargement often result in the sacrifice of some of the image at the edges.
one thing to note which i think is common to wide angle lenses, especially cheap lenses, is the light fall off or vignetting around the edges.
i never considered film photographers artistic because all one was doing was pushing a button.
whatever lens you get, you will be able to shoot at the correct focal length as opposed to the previous models (20d, 30d etc) which were x1.6 or thereabouts.
do not complain about high digicam prices.
shooting with film makes you think about so much more and makes you get a grip on things that digital will never teach you.
that is a bold statement, but having bought the very same printer myself and seeing the results from images taken with my 5d, i can understand his claim.
it's always good to hear people getting good cameras for a good price.
the is will help with camera shake more than the extra stop will for the same money.
compared to the more expensive canon bodies if you have $7000 to spend, a strong back to carry the weight, and a quick mind to take in the many displays and complex user interface, the eos 1ds mark ii might be better than the 5d. the canon eos 5d, however, will do most professional jobs.
i have so much control over my images, it scares me.
it really is hard to find a true proffessional photographer.
arguing that shooting film is a more creative process than shooting digital is like saying writing a novel with a pen and ink is more creative than using a typewriter or computer.
one nit: the 100mm f/2 is not the only alternative to the 70-200mm f/2.8l.
as soon as you scan a negative to digital in order to make an enlargement, you are losing quality, no matter how good the scanner is.
i really enjoyed being in the darkroom.
but then i got so many projects going using the "dry" darkroom in my computer.
canon 5d or 1d are beautiful cameras but i think film camera are still useful today.
the remark is also extremely snobbish.
no, nikon cannot match canon's sensor technology;they are not the electronics giant that canon is.
even af from basic minolta worked better than mine.
put another away, using a 100mm lens is going to give you an effective focal length of [approximately] 150mm when used with the 10d, 20d, 30d, and digital rebel series.
that's pretty good market share for grandpa's camera brand!
p.m. education bldg albany ny combining the 5d's high iso cleanliness + is provides hand held capabilities previously unheard of erwin baeyens , august 13, 2007; 10:54 a.m. frankly for being such a fantastic camera and for philip being an experienced photographer there are some seriously over exposed pictures on this review.
usm, (compare prices) (review), which is essential for day-to-day and low light photography, you will probably want the following standard professional zoom lenses: mercifully, canon does not include a cheap zoom lens as part of a "kit" with the eos 5d.
so it is not so professional as pretended.
digital pictures are different but damn, some of them are of wonderful color and quality.
what about autofocus in 5d. i've heard lot complaints from those who used nikon d200 and switched to canon 5d. after this they appreciate af they used to have in nikon.
so, your max print size will be a great...9,4x14.
ofcourse the brand has no impact on the photos you make, and neither does it make you a better photographer than you are.
at the 10k range, the benefit of mf is obvious, the single pixel size (pitch) is much larger (8.4um) than the 1ds mkiii's 6.4um.
a good camera without the right glass is useless too tom antonio (italy) , october 18, 2006; 05:49 p.m. i apologize for bad english grammar in my previous post... pedro p. polakoff iii , october 22, 2006; 03:24
unfortunately, i'm in the middle of a job and now will have to rely on my 1d to finish it.
the sensor plane is closer to the front of the camera with the smaller sensor cameras, nothing else.
however i like to use lenses as with film cameras: no crop factor.
and i am fine with 3-5 fps, as i am, like most people out there, not a sport event shooter (5fps will do the job well, though).
as soon as you scan a negative to digital in order to make an enlargement, you are losing quality, no matter how good the scanner is.
joao pedro jorge , january 13, 2008; 02:36 p.m. i've been reading reviews on the 5d and the 40d because i'm thinking of buying a new camera.
i think all we have seen thus far in the dslr game is not even the entire opening, to use a chess term.
in the digital world, however, what you capture in the camera is what you'll be delivering in a jpeg file, unless you go into a photo editing program and take the trouble to crop.
difficult to recreat with 35 mm, large format, or even digital cameras.
they hold thier value beautifully.
this is a photo of pro photographers using predominantly eos systems at the olympics in 2004, a very demanding situation where "every moment counts" (your phrase).
there is a diopter adjustment and you can change the focusing screen as well.
the only thing that worked was when the salesman used spot metering on the subject's face by going up in his face to lock in the exposure.
you may still be able to find the canon eos 5d, (compare prices), available from one of our partners.
canon is a massive company with the $billions to invest in building semiconductor fabrication lines.
a good photograph on a slide is still better resolution than most digital cameras (perhaps all), but if you scan it - you're re-sampling data, and that will cost you, and you might be better off with having taken the original with a digital camera.
i'm torn on buying the 5d. this dust thing seems to be an issue, vignetting due to light not falling evenly on full frame sensors(apparently a big problem for canon right now).
the 5d has a green "idiot mode" on the left control dial.
all canonusa could do for me was apologize and take down my information.
the 5d especially is excellent with wide angle and fish eye lenses.
you can't keep adjusting your lights and changing your settings.
too bad even my photos are great with this camera.
it certainly depends on the person using the camera and i believe that you need to have the flare and artistic ability to be able to use any camera (including digital) to produce beautiful images.
the 5d does not shoot at the blazing speeds of the newest canon dslr, but at present neither nikon nor anyone else has a digital camera with the kind of speed the 1d mark iii does.
i could buy the 1ds mark ii as a backup (kidding!).
so for many looking for a full frame caera a used 5d may well still be a good buy.
that is a bold statement, but having bought the very same printer myself and seeing the results from images taken with my 5d, i can understand his claim.
george carter , december 16, 2006; 03:19 p.m. i bought my first dslr a canon 30d about 6 months ago and have been well pleased.
as a matter of fact, i print photos not posters most of the time.
each camera had dust in the viewfinder and on the imaging sensor, the second body also had a problem (i thought) with the image numbering system, showing them as _mg_0001 rather than img_0001.
(the actual conversion factor is going to be about 1.6 for the canon small sensors, and about 1.5 for the nikon sensors, but 1.5 is close enough to be useful in practice for all of them.)
tom h , october 18, 2006; 09:59 a.m. evita it might be true that if you don't have an eye for shooting photographs a better camera will not change that.
a cheaper alternative but still good is the tamron range of lenses and they go down to f2.8 aswell for a fairly wide angled lens.
there is a pc connector on the side for studio strobes.
i currently own a 20d and prior to purchasing it had actually never used a "real" film camera (don't laugh but the only camera i had used was a single use disposable film camera).
the primary advantages of having a digital sensor the same size (24x36mm) as a frame of 35mm film are (1) higher image quality, especially in terms of noise and especially in lower light situations, and (2) the ability to use very wide angle lenses.
i use the 645 lenses on the 5d with a mirex adapter (shift comes in handy, since i do a lot of architecture).
it's always good to hear people getting good cameras for a good price.
in a year or two, of course, it will be just one more good camera.
digital has made it too easy for anyone to get into photography (i'm not saying this is a bad thing!).
if you're considering purchasing this camera from an online retailer, buyer beware.
it makes an image that goes into the computer nice n easy.
only canon builds dslr with full frame sensor right now.
it is more than good enough for most professional photojournalism applications, but still simple enough that a yuppie can get one to throw in the glovebox of his bmw suv and take pictures at the school soccer game.
you will have more fun.
the lcd is saturated and colors pop.
ok, i had no plans to shelv my pentax k1000, and even still had a desire to eventually convert an unused bathroom into a darkroom.
with the 5d, what you got with your 20mm lens on the film camera is what you get with the 5d. the canon eos 5d is compact and plasticky, but solidly built.
i think all we have seen thus far in the dslr game is not even the entire opening, to use a chess term.
in all things artistic it is the message not the media which is important.
autofocus performance is superb, even in dim light, with 15 af sensors distributed around the frame.
the learning curve is real and no less valid than that of understanding film and darkroom techniques.
note that, as with most digital single lens reflex cameras, the 5d cannot provide you with a preview in the rear lcd because the sensor is occluded by the viewing mirror until you press the shutter release.
you are not asking the design engineers to overcome significant and difficult design compromises by desiging "one wide angle zoom that suits all" etc.
after that i've found so many scams like that one that i recommend everyone doing the same before they buy their camera online.
the 5d does not shoot at the blazing speeds of the newest canon dslr, but at present neither nikon nor anyone else has a digital camera with the kind of speed the 1d mark iii does.
digital has mainstreamed the amount of people that can produce an amazing shot (by themselves, digital photography largely cuts out the middleman in mainstream film, ie.
now that we are at this point, give me a linhof super technika only it is an 8x10 and a mountain of 8x10 polaroid film and a processor.
however i know that doing a wedding or journalism is so much simpler with digital.
i'm in the market for a 5d and wouldn't mind waiting if i knew what the feature set would be.
autofocus performance is superb, even in dim light, with 15 af sensors distributed around the frame.
because this is not a zoom lens, it has many fewer individual pieces of glass inside and therefore you'll get the highest possible contrast and image quality.
if you are on the street and would like a dependable camera that understands you...go nikon.
from where you stay it's normal to have perspective because the viewpoint where you are when taking that photo is lower not perfectly "perpendicular" and also in the middle of the buildyng (sorry my english, i'm not a native...)
i currently own a 20d and prior to purchasing it had actually never used a "real" film camera (don't laugh but the only camera i had used was a single use disposable film camera).
compared to th 300d the 5d gives me quality prints close enough to film.
also i use the 24mm ts-e shift lens a lot for architecture, which would be impossible with any nikon or fuji camera.
i have won awards in art shows with digital pictures taken with a canon d60 at 6.3 megapixels, printed on an i9900 printer at 13x19.
i keep a small pocket-sized book with me with prints of my favorite photos.
both richer and more pleasing, and more "film like".
i do like the fact that it does have the 35mm size sensors and that it is built so similar to the 30d. i have been price checking and find several hundred dollars variation in prices.
jeremey barrett , may 18, 2007; 12:22 a.m. robert (ingram), the sigma dc 17-70 is designed for aps-c sized sensors, not full frame sensors like the 5d. the salesperson should absolutely have known that and they should take it back, it simply won't produce usable images on the 5d (light is only going to fall on portion of the sensor).
i think this is going to be my next birthday present, its just the weight & cost thats going to hurt - ouch.
but nonetheless the 5d is still probably the most affordable full frame around.
check out thomas hawk's photos www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk which are never shot with a flash and he often shoots in very lowlight at iso 1600.
the camera is always ready when you are.
this is a photo of pro photographers using predominantly eos systems at the olympics in 2004, a very demanding situation where "every moment counts" (your phrase).
ofcourse the brand has no impact on the photos you make, and neither does it make you a better photographer than you are.
it is my opinion that it is "cheating" to use some of the more advanced photoshop functions to manipulate your image because they allow you to create a "better" image than you originally captured.
microdrives are also more prone to failure than the solid-state cf cards and i do not recommend them.
i have used a canon 1ds mark i and ii and i found the quality to be excellent.
not that it matters, but i think one would do better to search for 5d on the eos forum than to pay much attention to the comments here.
if you are on the street and would like a dependable camera that understands you...go nikon.
you could be in the middle ages handing out 8x10 prints to spectators moments after the joust ended in a fatal impalement.
there is a greenish hue to everything, which is unnerving when you are under the gun on a paid shoot.
one last thing, i found my 28-80 was not wide enough in some situations for weddings.
i'll bring both along with me and use 3 or 4 lenses interchangeably (along with a little lx3 for videos and stereo shots).
--lannie shane phil , july 19, 2007; 12:46 a.m. i have tried both canon and nikon systems, and here is my 2 cents worth: canon is an excellent system if you have the time and patience to play around with its settings, especially the iso which is not automatic.
digital camera like canon 5d takes terrific images and are extremely useful tool for the most common circumstances.
a.m. hi how do you leave the 5d on a tripod and use a self timer that lasts for atleast an hour and shoot continously.
my 20d exposes backlighting perfectly and this camera costs over half as much of a 5d.
you could be in the middle ages handing out 8x10 prints to spectators moments after the joust ended in a fatal impalement.
and we all know that good home cooking is best, but sometimes a quick takeaway hits the spot as well.
so i am in the same: will continue scanning till they get a product that won't be obsolete in less than five years.
they are very fast for dslrs.
i just got everything in the mail today and i am experiencing major vignetting from this lens.
jeremey barrett , may 18, 2007; 12:22 a.m. robert (ingram), the sigma dc 17-70 is designed for aps-c sized sensors, not full frame sensors like the 5d. the salesperson should absolutely have known that and they should take it back, it simply won't produce usable images on the 5d (light is only going to fall on portion of the sensor).
the eos 5d is not designed for use in a continuous downpour or very dusty environment like the canon eos 1ds mark ii, though it is a basically rugged and well-sealed design.
the daunting nature of the processes involved in film would explain (along with relative cost) the explosion of new digital users.
i won't perform any manipulations such as replacing colors or pasting other "non-original" images into the photoa.
i love the fact that the 5d has 12.8 megs of image boosting power but for difficult shoots i find myself using the 20d. i really think canon dropped the ball on this one.
tom moore , january 25, 2007; 08:35 p.m. i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever did with film.
the eos 5d is not designed for use in a continuous downpour or very dusty environment like the canon eos 1ds mark ii, though it is a basically rugged and well-sealed design.
controls canon's eos 5d has the standard four exposure modes: metered manual, aperture-priority, shutter-priority, and program autoexposure.
there is no magnification with the smaller sensor cameras.
a little over sampling and sharpening seems to make a very nice print at 13x19.
whatever software you choose to use, you won't have to spend too much time post-processing due to the eos 5d's inclusion of a mercury switch to orient photos.
the 1.6 sensor makes my 400mm 640.
nikon's metering and flash systems are state of the art.
similarly, if we assert that digital photographers are somehow disadvantaged by having to contend with the colour space interpretations of a third-party, while not mentioning the colour bias traditionally imparted by different makes of film, it seems nonsensical.
usm, (compare prices) (review), which is essential for day-to-day and low light photography, you will probably want the following standard professional zoom lenses: canon ef 16-35mm f/2.8l ii usm, (compare prices) canon ef 70-200 f/2.8l is ii usm, (compare prices)
find a extremely rare and sought after collectors film camera and outfit it with the outstanding rare and obscure sought after glass.
thus you're able to manually adjust focus but have automatic assistance available when desired.
i'm very fond of wide lens photography and i wouldn't like to lose my cheap 19-35mm :).
i've read many posts regarding dust issues right out of the box.
wow, we are in the early stages of digital photography, think how people will see early digital as oldskool and cool, a footprint of our current age.
i do not choose a camera based solely on market share, of course, but such data are not irrelevant to me.
be aware of online scams.
i do not know about the engineering but i seem to get much better pictures in low light situations with the fullframe.

collect cans and shoot weddings with a popcan pinhole array!
but in order to do that you first have to downsize the pictures to match the beamer's resoloution, which is somewhat less than 1.75mp if it is bang up to date and hd-ready with 1080i.
i found two shops that sell the 5d for $849 and the 400d for $339 which is incredibly cheap.
i ended up using it like a (very expensive!)point and shoot.
the 13-megapixel canon eos 5d single-lens reflex digital camera is the first consumer-priced ($2700) full-frame sensor body.
you may want to do what i'm going to do, buy it from a local retailer where you can inspect it first.
as with all of the great canon eos bodies over the decades, if you drill down into the custom function menus, you can figure out how to make the autoexposure lock button on the back of the camera into a "burst of af" thumb switch while in manual focus mode.
the camera has an internal buffer memory for rapid sequence photography (17 raws or 60 jpegs).
george carter , december 16, 2006; 03:19 p.m. i bought my first dslr a canon 30d about 6 months ago and have been well pleased.
you will also see who has thier work hanging in art galleries and museums, and all the true art publications.
i already own a sigma 10-20mm and a nikon 18-200mm for this job.
nedine o'brien , february 27, 2007; 06:21 a.m. greetings all, i've only been studying photography for three years and started doing b&w film in a wet darkroom.
but having a crappy camera and a great eye prevents you from getting the right output especially if you think of commercially gaining from it.
from where you stay it's normal to have perspective because the viewpoint where you are when taking that photo is lower not perfectly "perpendicular" and also in the middle of the buildyng (sorry my english, i'm not a native...)
just great for reportage, especially in low light situations.
i don't see the interpolated finepix megapixels exceed the canon.
there are two control wheels so that you can adjust aperture and shutter speed simultaneously.
about the only reason i can see to ante up the extra money and haul around the added weight of the 70-200mm f/2.8l would be if one routinely takes action pictures in low light or if one is obsessively enamored of blurry backgrounds.
for taking pictures of sporting events without breaking your arm, you'll want acanon ef 300mm f/4l is usm, (compare prices) (review).
joao pedro jorge , january 13, 2008; 02:36 p.m. i've been reading reviews on the 5d and the 40d because i'm thinking of buying a new camera.
the is will help with camera shake more than the extra stop will for the same money.
my 5ds had a defective light meter.
just great for reportage, especially in low light situations.
a little consideration more: the hasselblad h3d-22 (that's a heavy medium format bazooka) has a 4080x5440 square format sensor that produce a 22mpx file or, in print-size terms, a 13x18 print.
i.e., sports photographers might want to consider one of the eos 1d bodies specifically designed for their rapid-fire needs.
no dings, scratches, and best of all no internal damage to camera or lens.
eye relief is just barely adequate for people wearing eyeglasses.
heck, the pentax k10d trounces the 40d due solely to its in body anti shake.
memory card i can shoot away all day long and statistically speaking i will have a few great images; with film unless i had tons of cash i would have to plan my shots and make decisions on which to take.
digital has made it too easy for anyone to get into photography (i'm not saying this is a bad thing!).
when i work i constantly use the histogram and i need to make snap judgments based on the lcd image and my exposure readings.
kudos to the many moderate voices above and those that focus on the individual's artistic process above considerations of equipment and technology.
maximum flash sync speed is 1/200th.
the reason why you don't have perfect paralel lings there.
i must say that the 5d's image quality is great.
it is more than good enough for most professional photojournalism applications, but still simple enough that a yuppie can get one to throw in the glovebox of his bmw suv and take pictures at the school soccer game.
would be quite happy using l series primes, only need to purchase 25mm l and that would complete my lens complement.
arguing that shooting film is a more creative process than shooting digital is like saying writing a novel with a pen and ink is more creative than using a typewriter or computer.
the difference between film and digital isn't that any rich moron can take great pictures with a $7000 camera (they can't).
the canon always looks to me like reduced, i guess it is the color palette, or the cmos sensors.
i would not sell any of my images.
******************************************** hi brian-i don't think i am really qualified to answer any questions in this forum but will take a guess at the answer to this one simply because no one else has replied.
this is particularly the case as i like to take a fair number of wide angle - generally 25mm ( in 35 mm slr speak) to 35mm.
janice m , february 19, 2007; 01:29 a.m. brian's question: "i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever did with film."
though noisier than a point-and-shoot digital camera, the canon eos 5d is extremely quiet in operation, quieter than any modern film body and with a slightly more muted and lower frequency shutter "thunk" than the small sensor canon bodies.
digital camera like canon 5d takes terrific images and are extremely useful tool for the most common circumstances.
microdrives are also more prone to failure than the solid-state cf cards and i do not recommend them.
in some respects, art is the way one interprets what one perceives and presents that interpretation so others can experience that expression.
crop and zoom are clear and sharp.
i only shoot in digital and believe my photography is beauty which i have created and cherish the percentage of the shots which are excellent.
i have not thrown away my watercolors or my 35 mm cameras etc., i have just added to what i enjoy.
i've read many posts regarding dust issues right out of the box.
dynamic range while ok in the 5d is not as good as the s3 pro (and now the s5).
if you are rich and dumb, i would definitly suggest going digital.
if you're going to take a lot of portraits, e.g., of a baby, and don't want to endure the weight of the 70-200/2.8, consider a primecanon ef 100mm f/2 usm, (compare prices) (review).
just google the name of the shop and reviews, like, in my case was: "bestpricecameras reviews" so, it seems that the cheapest 40d (not scam) price was around $1000 and the 5d around $2200.
one nit: the 100mm f/2 is not the only alternative to the 70-200mm f/2.8l.
the d2xs is a superb camera, but don't have the large canon's sensor nor the tremendous s5 dynamic range.
nicholas eskey , april 03, 2008; 02:10 a.m. i was in ritz camera store today, looking to see if they still had canon 5d's in stock, since most of the camera stores in san diego seem to not, and i spoke with the counter guy about it.
i use photoshop but only to do the most basic image adjustments such as cropping, resizing, adjusting levels and curves, etc.
amazon... not so much- trying to be everything to everyone has negatively impacted their customer service.
the 5d has the standard focus modes of any canon slr: manual, single-shot auto, continuous auto, and "ai focus" where the camera tries to figure out whether or not your subject is moving.
i bought the digirebel (body only) 18 mos ago and this camera paid for itself immediately because i used to spend-at a minimum-at least $100 per month in film and developing.
i do notice that sales are going up and higher resolution, better colours, less distortion etc. is not the last reason for that :) and don't forget glass.
this is a big step up from the 10d and 20d which i use for back up, but i agree that the industry is geting too pricy for consumer or semi pro photographers.
as for the 5d, i bought mine over a year ago and love it every second of the time i am using it, as well as looking at the finished work.
without some kind of linguistic shorthand here, we are going to have to teach basic physics every time we try to discuss lens selection--leaving the typical photographer with either glazed eyes or a dumbfounded expression.
sensitivity is adjustable from iso 50-3200 but there is no good reminder of what you've got set and the setting is persistent if you turn the camera off and back on overnight.
viewfinder coverage on the canon eos 5d is standard for an advanced amateur single-lens reflex camera, about 96 percent of what is recorded on the sensor is displayed in the viewfinder.
would be quite happy using l series primes, only need to purchase 25mm l and that would complete my lens complement.
if you are a serious photographer, you will want to purchase and carry a backup bp-511a battery (the same battery that canon has used in the 20d and the gn point-and-shoot models).
however i know that doing a wedding or journalism is so much simpler with digital.
that's pretty sad, considering what a tour de force of technology the 5d's sensor is.
vincent martin , july 30, 2006; 05:01 a.m. i have read the above and there are a great variety of inputs and some poinient and timely infomrations.
i suggest mr. greenspun do a little more research before making completely invalid statements which mislead camera buyers and uniformed photographers.
xiaoyuan gu , november 28, 2007; 10:12 a.m. it is time for canon to throw the goodies of 1d mkiii and 40d to a 5d mkii, to seriously compete with the nikon d3.
if so, i would prefer to get by with the quality small sensor 40d.
i have a quality range of l series glass and if i went down the full frame path, would purchase couple of wide angle primes.
dynamic range while ok in the 5d is not as good as the s3 pro (and now the s5).
the canon eos 5d cannot run on disposable aa batteries.
with the 5d, what you got with your 20mm lens on the film camera is what you get with the 5d. the canon eos 5d is compact and plasticky, but solidly built.
i got two cheap lenses: the ordinary ef 28-90 and a voigtlander 19-35mm.
it's status as 'last season's fashion' will help drive second hand
if the 5d is a tough as my 30d i will be well pleased.
it's just seems ironic to me that a $3000-2500 camera doesn't have a lcd screen as good as my $500 point and shoot.
i for one regret immensely never being schooled in film, however there is so much to learn in digital as well.
i would also, obviously, love their to be a price reduction, but that might be wishful thinking.
the canon eos 5d turns on almost instantly and has unmeasureable delays for taking pictures, displaying previews, and waking up once asleep.
but i think film camera are still useful today.
more and more people are going digital, thus driving down demand and prices for film gear.
after seeing countless people come in with photos from a hell of a lot of different proffessional cameras, i would have to say that almost everything from the canon 5d has been the closest i have seen to film quality.
i think the true test of a photographer is attempting to take the same quality images with a film camera, as you can create using a digital camera with hours of photoshop work afterwards.
if i decide to switch to canon now is the time since i don't have too much nikon equipment.
as for the 5d, i bought mine over a year ago and love it every second of the time i am using it, as well as looking at the finished work.
if you downloadmicrosoft raw image thumbnailer and viewer for windows xp, you can sort photos to some extent just using the standard windows file browser.
operating speed the canon eos 5d turns on almost instantly and has unmeasureable delays for taking pictures, displaying previews, and waking up once asleep.
you can't be going into the bride and groom's face to lock in an exposure reading.
when working with raw images, this is rather sluggish on all but the very newest and most powerful pcs.
after 'restoring' them for presentation at my father's 90th birthday, i found i rather liked the feel of these vintage images and now find myself trying to make new images look old.
the underscore means the white space was changed from srgb to adobe rgb.
digital unlocks creative possibilities because you never have to worry about how many shots you have left (or how many you need to get the image you want).
as a canon user with too much money sunk into the system to switch on a whim like the beginners without a good set of lenses or the moneyed elite who seem to switch weekly, i hope that nikon absolutely trounces canon with its new full frame d3 and its d300 cameras.
in all it's been a hell of a workhorse camera for me, producing consistently high quality images even under adverse conditions.
if you are a workhorse photographer, that is you are commercial, then you have things like time and money to worry about, and you need to find the best and most efficient and inexpensive tool for the job.
canon's quality control has diminished in my mind and i'm disappointed that all they would do was document my two cases of dust right out of the box.
i have found some really good deals on medium format cameras.
but much more important than resouloution is the amount of contrast that you can record.
the canon eos 5d does not have a built-in flash.
search for prices for the camera i wanted.
the noise just looks like a bad quality image to me it doesn't give the atmosphere or mood that film grain does.
zhero.net jonathan farmer , march 22, 2007; 01:31 p.m. can anyone give a honest opinion on how the 5d, d2xs and the finepix s5 compare with respect to image quality.
" conclusion the canon eos 5d is the essential camera for everything that photographers used to do with 35mm film.
if you are a serious photographer, you will want to purchase and carry a backup bp-511a battery (the same battery that canon has used in the 20d and the gn point-and-shoot models).
but nonetheless the 5d is still probably the most affordable full frame around.
in my humble opinion, it is not the equipment or the media it is the art, the composition, inspiration and good light that makes a good picture.
10:54 a.m. frankly for being such a fantastic camera and for philip being an experienced photographer there are some seriously over exposed pictures on this review.
my oldest son it taking a photography class, and i found out to my dismay, it is a digital photography class.
it makes an image that goes into the computer nice n easy.
digital cameras and the digital workflow have made creating or capturing a great image much easier and much more likely for novice and amateur photographers (i admit i am one of these people however i have a "moral code" regarding the level of digital adjustments i will make).
you will also see who has thier work hanging in art galleries and museums, and all the true art publications.
for my purposes, though, resolution and low light performance aren't huge issues, so my olympus e1 is actually better in other regards: much smaller and lighter, weatherproofed, and better lenses (in my price range).
i'm no big fan of nikon, i just like the cameras they make.
i shoot glamour and getting those warm glowing skintones is paramount.
all in all, the 5d has made me shoot things i would never have shot without it.
as a keen amateur for 25 years, i've owned a 5d for almost a year now and continue to be wowed by the results it yields, with, like any camera, a discerning eye, a sensitivity for the subject matter and a sense of imagination...
i have read that nikon produce better color and resolution and that many people are sold more on the amount of megapixles than anything else, please see the link below.
i took it to canon factory service and they said there was nothing they could do.
the common error that philip greenspun's review push forward is thinking that digital camera is the best solution for all or, in another formulation, that digital camera are simply better than film ones.
mercifully, canon does not include a cheap zoom lens as part of a "kit" with the eos 5d.
these may be more expensive than the sigma but the point of having a 5d is so you can produce quality pictures, so go with the quality lens aswell!!
with digital one has to be very precise and disciplined in order to not "overshoot" and make thousands of worthless crap pictures without any appeal and interest.
home > equipment > canon > eos 5d jon sienckiewicz offers a juiced-up user guide for creative people via his "missing pages" column on photo.net.
it is still a great camera but showing its age with only a 4.1 mp imaging sensor.
i.e., sports photographers might want to consider one of the eos 1d bodies specifically designed for their rapid-fire needs.
you are not asking the design engineers to overcome significant and difficult design compromises by desiging "one wide angle zoom that suits all" etc.
balancing flash and natural light is straightforward.
memory card i can shoot away all day long and statistically speaking i will have a few great images; with film unless i had tons of cash i would have to plan my shots and make decisions on which to take.
sure, i could build a great vintage camera for much less money than a 5d, but i'd spend more on film, paper, chemicals and processing in 1 month than i would on a good digital camera.
well, i love the 5d camera, but to dismiss nikon as a small company with clever optical engineers is, well, way, way off.
after much review, i am purchasing the 5d. i think it will be a wonderful brush to paint with.
the 30d got jerked off a folding table and hit a concrete floor and bounced first on one corner, next on the lens shade, and finally on it's back.
the 5d, on the other hand, is better in the following situations: you have a lot of older canon eos lenses that cast a full-frame image you love wide angle photography and want to have a good choice of wide angle lenses you want to take pictures in low light without a flash you think it is ridiculous to haul around a huge heavy lens designed to cover the 24x36mm frame of film and then only capture the central 15x22mm portion with a small sensor slr.
film kills digital, i know this.
now, though not being a maniac of the very latest gadget, the possibility of a new 5d version makes me slow down my upgrade...
this is very useful for tripod and macro work.
i enjoy film and still purchase film equipment.
its hard to find real photographers now as anyone with a fairly good digital is now branding themselves as pro photographers......
i am waiting for the 5d mkii, and keeping my finger crossed that canon with stay with 12mp to keep the single pixel size of 8.2um of the 5d, and come up with a quality lcd such as that found on the new nikons, dust removal (5d is a dust magnet) and liveview functions.
the reason why you don't have perfect paralel lings there.
i'll bring both along with me and use 3 or 4 lenses interchangeably (along with a little lx3 for videos and stereo shots).
it is much cheaper for canon to make a small sensor than a big sensor.
if you have $7000 to spend, a strong back to carry the weight, and a quick mind to take in the many displays and complex user interface, the eos 1ds mark ii might be better than the 5d. the canon eos 5d, however, will do most professional jobs.
digital cameras and the digital workflow have made creating or capturing a great image much easier and much more likely for novice and amateur photographers (i admit i am one of these people however i have a "moral code" regarding the level of digital adjustments i will make).
to recharge the battery you must carry a chunky travel charger that plugs directly into a wall socket.
similarly, if we assert that digital photographers are somehow disadvantaged by having to contend with the colour space interpretations of a third-party, while not mentioning the colour bias traditionally imparted by different makes of film, it seems nonsensical.
canon still has a bit to learn from nikon in some areas.
the following images were taken at iso 800: the included lith-ion battery is adequate for a day of active photography, somewhere between 300 and 500 photos plus review.
i just can't seem to get a saturated look on the lcd and it causes frustration during the shoot.
if you take 100 pictures in quick succession, don't be alarmed when the "low battery" symbols flashes.
after 'restoring' them for presentation at my father's 90th birthday, i found i rather liked the feel of these vintage images and now find myself trying to make new images look old.
these may be more expensive than the sigma but the point of having a 5d is so you can produce quality pictures, so go with the quality lens aswell!!
i am thinking about a 5d, but frankly i shoot wildlife on the wing that shows well and once in a while sells with the 6.3 i have.
i have much more respect for a photographer who creates a wonderful sunset image with both the sky and foreground having a good balance of exposure than someone who merged two images together and created a high dynamic range image.
it is still a great camera but showing its age with only a 4.1 mp imaging sensor.
i use photoshop but only to do the most basic image adjustments such as cropping, resizing, adjusting levels and curves, etc.
although i have never shot either, the specs on the nikon d200 and the nikon d2x are very, very impressive.
i had own my own photo business which i closed about the time i converted to digital in 2003.
so for many looking for a full frame caera a used 5d may well still be a good buy.
it has meant a huge learning curve for me.
i don't believe you can take a grainy image with digital.
a little over sampling and sharpening seems to make a very nice print at 13x19.
patty larue , october 28, 2010; 10:20 a.m. i have the canon 5d and have been using with the 70-200 heavy lens for portrait work and weddings can someone please tell me what other lens to buy to replace this heavy lens for every day before i have to have surgery my neck can not take it.
if you do not create your art and have a bonafide craft in digital art (like making fantastic looking things painstakingly in photoshop or other based primarily on visions in your head), then you are basically putting your faith in those who decided how a certain color etc. should be rendered on a screen ie color spaces, color balance and the like.
the creative process is not dependant on the tools.
i then went to a local camera store and had the sales person recreate a backlit situation in store with the same results.
nikon is a small company with clever optical engineers.
the richness and detail of his photos at 1600 are amazing.
i rather, uh, suspect that phil g. is aware of the crop factor if an idiot such as myself is, and that is why he was very careful to insert the word "effectively."
some reviewers think that the 70-200mm f/4l is is a "better" lens (sharpness, etc) than the f/2.8l at the same apertures.
guido ersettigh (milan) , october 08, 2006; 05:45 p.m. claudia our friend knows well perspective theory in fact he used a lens that lets you basculate its axis in order to correct perspective distortion along one direction - optical bank lets you move, thanks to the bellow system, in any direction so you can correct distortion along any axis or put an whole item in focus even if it's not parallel to the lens -.
but having a crappy camera and a great eye prevents you from getting the right output especially if you think of commercially gaining from it.
the camera has an internal buffer memory for rapid sequence photography (17 raws or 60 jpegs).
i think this is going to be my next birthday present, its just the weight & cost thats going to hurt - ouch.
i am afraid that the answer is the first one, because canon don't say anything about it in the "specs", anouncing it proudly when they explain the advantages of the new brand eos-1ds mark iii.
after seeing countless people come in with photos from a hell of a lot of different proffessional cameras, i would have to say that almost everything from the canon 5d has been the closest i have seen to film quality.
nikon's build quality and ergronomics are way ahead of canon's.
even a camera like the d40 has a much superior lcd than the 5d.tests say the nikon's vibration reduction system is better than canon's is system.
i won't perform any manipulations such as replacing colors or pasting other "non-original" images into the photoa.
i am hoping to use a d2x and get the same quality but maybe the 5d will do well.
digital is just someone's opinion, but i find it highly inflammatory for no reason at all.
it may not make a lot of sense to anyone else, but i've found utility in blue-channel noise that most everyone else wants to disown.
they're 13mpx, that's to say near the state of the art for a digital 35mm size-like camera.
if he had not seen the problem, he would not have chosen his words so carefully.
the canon speedlite 580ex ii flash, (compare prices) (review) is canon's current top of the line and it usefully covers an angle as wide as a 14mm lens.
it is maybe not a spectacular, but a very solid and high quality camera that can give very good files.
if they have not explored film far enough, and do not require some huge size out of the ordinary output, they probably will not know what they are missing switching to digital.
janice m , february 19, 2007; 01:29 a.m. brian's question: "i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever did with film."
you cannot use those mediums in the same way yet you have what is called a 'painting' in the end.
i loved shooting in film for sooo long, but even the negs of the pictures i took are just sitting up in a box somewhere.
vincent martin , july 30, 2006; 05:01 a.m. i have read the above and there are a great variety of inputs and some poinient and timely infomrations.
although not the fastest camera for action shots, it is hardly "a patient studio photographer's camera," and no one who has used it would characterize it thus.
the eos 30d and digital rebel are better values.
i have to admit, however, that both the nikon d200 and the nikon d2x shoot more frames per second than the 5d.
unfortunately that particular lens with 5d seems to produce an elliptical unexpected distortion.
i've got two extra batteries so i may bring them along, although i'm all but certain no one will let me take a photo to test the sensor.
this sounds great and indeed would be great on a film camera where slide mounts and cropping during enlargement often result in the sacrifice of some of the image at the edges.
as for printing, guess what, i can print to slides from digital just as easy as printing on paper if i want to go wet.
but i noticed right away when shooting some models with strobes, they looked like crap
i took it to canon factory service and they said there was nothing they could do.
(the guys you see on television might have the 600/4, but that comes in its own suitcase and costs more than a small kia sedan.)
i work mostly with available light so i have to have to make sure i buy a camera that is best for low lighting conditions - i shoot hotel interiors and exteriors as well as very high resolution virtual tours of cockpits.
it may not make a lot of sense to anyone else, but i've found utility in blue-channel noise that most everyone else wants to disown.
the richness and detail of his photos at 1600 are amazing.
i have shot over 8000 images with my 5d now and evey single one has rivaled the quality of scanned negatives shot with my leica.
i find myself now with amazing distortions (ellypses) and the canon pro services recently told me it was the "inconvenience" of full frame captors.
though noisier than a point-and-shoot digital camera, the canon eos 5d is extremely quiet in operation, quieter than any modern film body and with a slightly more muted and lower frequency shutter "thunk" than the small sensor canon bodies.
if he had not seen the problem, he would not have chosen his words so carefully.
when working with raw images, this is rather sluggish on all but the very newest and most powerful pcs.
as evita m put it so concisely, the real magic lies with the person taking the photograph.. and frequently, the luck of catching a passing moment as it happens.. whether a facial expression or the momentous interplay of light and landscape.
a photographer has to be more skilled to use film than digital.
i also enjoy digital photography and have been able to support my hobby by creating portraits for people through digital art.
the sensor plane is closer to the front of the camera with the smaller sensor cameras, nothing else.
i use the 645 lenses on the 5d with a mirex adapter (shift comes in handy, since i do a lot of architecture).
i don't own many lenses - 10.5mm and the 18-70 that came with the d70.
a real photographer is the one who composes the shot perfectly and with their knowledge and technical ability will be able to capture a beautiful photo in 1 single shot rather than taking hundreds and finding the best one.
aside from all my rambling though, the 5d is definately the best digital camera out there!
i don't believe you can take a grainy image with digital.
there are no "winners" just have fun with what you like, and stop putting others down just to satisfy your own egomania.
a good camera without the right glass is useless too tom antonio (italy) , october 18, 2006; 05:49 p.m. i apologize for bad english grammar in my previous post... pedro p. polakoff iii , october 22, 2006; 03:24
in some respects, art is the way one interprets what one perceives and presents that interpretation so others can experience that expression.
kudos to the many moderate voices above and those that focus on the individual's artistic process above considerations of equipment and technology.
i would guess that the photographer (myself included) can take way more pictures and cheaper than using film because digital pictures are all free until processed.
featured merchants canon eos 5d 12.8 megapixel digital slr camera body with lens kit - 0.94"-4.13" vendor vendor rating availability price there are currently no sellers for this product.
as with all of the great canon eos bodies over the decades, if you drill down into the custom function menus, you can figure out how to make the autoexposure lock button on the back of the camera into a "burst of af" thumb switch while in manual focus mode.
i have been looking at the 5d as my primary and my 30d as my backup so i won't be losing time changing lenses.
do not complain about high digicam prices.
digital camera which will be 108mp mamiya ofcourse, and it will accept all my rb67 lenses and ektars.
the only disadvantage to having a full-frame sensor compared to a small-sensor digital slr body (canon digital rebel or any nikon) is that the small-sensor effectively increases the magnification of telephoto lenses, which can be useful when you are doing sports or bird photography.
any idiot can use a 7000 dollar digital camera.
when i work i constantly use the histogram and i need to make snap judgments based on the lcd image and my exposure readings.
(seemy photoshop directory for some useful scripts, including those that were used to generate the jpegs you see on this page.)
so it is not so professional as pretended.
i've done both, and personally, digital allows me sooo much more access to my photos.
digicams will all turn to dust but the film cameras of yesterday will be solid as a rock.
i already own a sigma 10-20mm and a nikon 18-200mm for this job.
with digital one has to be very precise and disciplined in order to not "overshoot" and make thousands of worthless crap pictures without any appeal and interest.
to make a very long story short: both fuji and canon have their strengths, the canon with the right converter for raw (i prefer canons own one) can produce quite nice looking results, sharp, low noise etc.
but in order to do that you first have to downsize the pictures to match the beamer's resoloution, which is somewhat less than 1.75mp if it is bang up to date and hd-ready with 1080i.
in the digital world, however, what you capture in the camera is what you'll be delivering in a jpeg file, unless you go into a photo editing program and take the trouble to crop.
and the 50d with its big pixel count in a small crop sensor and the full frame 5d mk ii are both more capable in their noise reduction and in other ways.
plus, you can take more...many more of them and print or save only the good photos.
lol a bit of dust and air pollution is not enough to name mexico a measure parameter for camera resistance.
on the lcd skintones look washed out, the finally result on my laptop looked fine
not that it matters, but i think one would do better to search for 5d on the eos forum than to pay much attention to the comments here.
wow, we are in the early stages of digital photography, think how people will see early digital as oldskool and cool, a footprint of our current age.
having recently found a great deal on a 16-35l,it seems clear that i should do the right thing and move from a rebel to a 5d(mkii still a little pricey) to get the full-impact of the glass.
my comments have no impact whatsoever on the market image of either canon or nikon.
however, whilst there are many happy-snappers out there, who go from low resolution jpeg straight to printer, without so much as a mention of photoshop or the like, there are also photographers, amateur and professional, who are increasingly learning to understand and use the digital medium to great effect.
i find myself now with amazing distortions (ellypses) and the canon pro services recently told me it was the "inconvenience" of full frame captors.
i rather, uh, suspect that phil g. is aware of the crop factor if an idiot such as myself is, and that is why he was very careful to insert the word "effectively."
canon's quality control has diminished in my mind and i'm disappointed that all they would do was document my two cases of dust right out of the box.
difficult to recreat with 35 mm, large format, or even digital cameras.
incredible photos, i have no more need for film.
if you've pressed the playback button and are reviewing images, a quick touch of the shutter release readies the camera to take pictures again.
the best test really is to hand the camera to a novice and see what happens.
on the lcd skintones look washed out, the finally result on my laptop looked fine
as a keen amateur for 25 years, i've owned a 5d for almost a year now and continue to be wowed by the results it yields, with, like any camera, a discerning eye, a sensitivity for the subject matter and a sense of imagination...
05:07 a.m. i have had my canon 5d for about 10 weeks now and i love it a superb camera,you can crop a small part of a file and the result is still very good,i also like the idea of changing the iso for each shot when i want to and i can do it just over a second with no bother at all,the only setting i use is the iso 50 setting for when i want to use it,some times i use the mirror setting so when you press the shutter release the mirror shoots up and went you press the shuter release again it will take the photo which is a good idea when taking macro shots as the mirror will not vibrate then !
i would also, obviously, love their to be a price reduction, but that might be wishful thinking.
people throw away old computers just like they will throw away digital cameras.
danny yee , december 30, 2006; 06:35 p.m. the one thing that really impressed me when i had a play with a friend's 5d was the viewfinder.
yes, canon can do 14bit ad conversion, but if the pixel picks up only nosier data at first hand, more resolution in the ad stage simply won't help much - (amplifying the noise)?
sometimes readers, in their emotion, do not read quite so carefully.
as for the 5d, yes, i believe that it has been worth the hype, in spite of its limitations in terms of speed.
