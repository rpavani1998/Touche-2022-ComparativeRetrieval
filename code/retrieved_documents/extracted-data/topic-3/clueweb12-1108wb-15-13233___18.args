on close scrutiny the detail in images from the d3s is impressive.
vs canon eos 1d mark iv: iso and noise low-light shooting and super-high iso performance appear to be the priority for the manufacturers of both cameras.
the d3s was tested with a nikon af-s 24-70mm f/2.8g ed lens, and the 1d with a canon ef 24-105mm f/4l is usm.
both cameras also have a hefty price tag – an rrp of over £4,000 and street prices of £3,600 and £3,850 for the nikon and canon respectively.
once you navigate away from the default settings and start customising the camera to your specific requirements, the focus performance really comes into its own.
frustrated canon users can now relish themark iv’s awesome performance.

the fact that both cameras were able to deliver this quality of image when shooting at 9 frames per second or more is simply astonishing.
this portrait reveals that the d3s can produce decent images with a good dynamic range and tonality.
stats like this don’t come cheap, but the cameras are also competitive when it comes to price.

the d3s’s 51-point af system was fast and responsive in demanding lighting conditions.

the fact that both cameras were able to deliver this quality of image when shooting at 9 frames per second or more is simply astonishing.
however, images with both cameras shot at iso 12800 were impressive and very usable.
we tested the cameras in a variety of set-ups and modes, from the fully auto 3d colour matrix metering on thenikon d3s and evaluative mode on the canon eos 1d mark iv to the spot metering modes on both cameras.
the 1d mark iv also did a good job of capturing a range of tones correctly in tricky lighting conditions.
the canon eos 1d mark iv has a uniquely sized 16.1mp cmos aps-h sensor, which is half way between full frame and aps-c. this gives a crop factor of x1.3, and while some users might be disappointed that the camera isn’t full frame, others – especially sports photographers shooting from the touchline – will find that little bit of extra reach they can get from their telephoto lenses a real bonus nikon has gone for full-frame, offering a 12.1mp fx cmos sensor.
both cameras are outstanding, and it’s unlikely that anyone would be disappointed with their performance and the quality of images they produce.
the camera produced clean and crisp images despite the fact that it has fewer pixels.
put two bruiser dslrs like the d3s and 1d mark iv into the ring and you’re guaranteed a good, clean fight.

while images taken at this boosted iso setting are incredibly noisy, it will facilitate hand-held shooting in near darkness without the need for a flash.
out of the box thecanon eos 1d mark iv delivered more accurate metering and colour rendition than the nikon d3s, but the d3s could easily be customised to compensate for this.
the d3s might not have the megapixel advantage of the 1d mark iv, but the detail and definition when zoomed in to 100% is superior.
the good news is that pro technology has a habit of migrating down the ranks,
both cameras can ‘boost’ their high iso performance to a whopping 102400.
as a result, they’re targeted at professional photographers, especially those who shoot sports, press photos or wildlife.
we shot our subject under different lighting conditions, with a range of poses and action set-ups.
these subjects can present some of the most challenging and demanding conditions for photographers to work in.
this could prove a shrewd decision by nikon, which has anticipated the demands of photographers and sought to combine the best of both worlds with impressive speed and guaranteed quality in equal measure.
nikon vs canon iso test results… the exceptionally high iso performance of both cameras is really good, but there’s definitely more chromatic noise in the1d mark iv images  at the high end of the scale.
the d3s boasts a 51-point af system with 15 cross points, and it was fast and effective in our tests.
if you’ve read our nikon d3s and canon eos 1d mark iv reviews, you’ll know that both these high-end dslrs have been designed for the same purpose – high-speed photography.
the colours captured by the 1d mark iv here are pleasing and vibrant, with greater warmth than those from the d3s. they were more impressive and natural when viewed unaltered straight out of the camera.
whennikon revealed the d3s back in october 2009 it wowed the ever-demanding photographic community with astronomically high iso settings.

the d3s shoots at 9 frames per second (fps), unless you’re using a nikkor dx lens – then the camera switches to crop mode, and the frame rate is increased to 11fps.

both are at the top of their game, and unquestionably the best dslrs on the market for sports and action photographers who demand superb quality, outstanding performance and super-quick shooting from their gear.
this system is less of a radical departure than that of its predecessor, but then unlike the af on the mark iii, it didn’t need significant improvement.

even in the challenging light of a locker room, both cameras’ intelligent metering systems worked a treat.
the canon offers a constant 10fps, making it the winner in the speed stakes.
that said, nikon has tuned the d3s’s contrast detection system to provide focusing support during movie capture and live view shooting.

while it might not boast the impressive pixel count of the mark iv it’s arguably not a camera targeted at the pixel-counting audience, and there are still more than enough pixels to facilitate a tighter crop if needed.
what distinguishes these cameras from other dslrs is their ability to capture fast-moving action shots and work in low-light situations.
vs canon eos 1d mark iv: autofocus and frame rate fast, accurate focusing combined with a fast frame rate (and generous buffer) is critical for action, press and wildlife photographers, and in this area both cameras performed exceptionally well in our tests, which we carried out under limited indoor light.
it’s noticeable that the d3s produced images with a more muted colour palette in auto white balance mode.

this system is less of a radical departure than that of its predecessor, but then unlike the af on the mark iii, it didn’t need significant improvement.
it’s fair to say that both cameras are fast enough for most shooting situations, and while it might be superficial they sound and feel awesome too, especially when you fire off a round of shots.
while not quite as impressive as images from the d3s, the level of detail and definition captured by the 1d mark iv is still pretty amazing.
if you’ve already bought into a nikon or canon system, the results of this test will be somewhat academic, as neither camera presents a compelling reason to switch systems.
both cameras have evolved relatively seamlessly from their predecessors (the d3 and 1d mark iii, respectively), so users already familiar with the canon or nikon layout will feel instantly at home.
combined with slight underexposure, the colours seemed more ‘conservative’ than those captured by the 1d mark iv.

the large pixel pitch and a modified inner structure catapulted nikon to the front of the iso race, with staggeringly impressive low-light performance thanks to an iso range of 200 to 12800.
