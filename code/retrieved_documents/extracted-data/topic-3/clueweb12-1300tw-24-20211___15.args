by not doing so they lost thousands of loyal users to the 5d mark ii.
when it comes to the low light iso test, the nikon wins handily.
sure i can shoot those types of things, but it’s not the best tool.
when you use cameras with this high of resolution,  you have very small sensels, and everything you do when creating an image affects the final “real” resolution and dynamic range you can achieve from any camera.
i don’t care about how many frames per second (which is about 1) it shoots, how fast it focuses (which isn’t fast) or high iso.

that’s difficult because it’s created by engineers and is really an engineering standard.
for example the g11 achieves a higher score than the g10, even though it has only 2/3rds the resolution.
at what point does too much light reach the sensor so the sensels recording the dress saturate, meaning the camera can no longer record the difference between the subtle variations in white which provide the detail in the dress.
all this chart really proves is the d800 performs better at higher iso's.
the real test will be in prints.
one other challenge of the dxo marks is how they arrive at the “overall” score, 95 for the d800 and 91 for the iq180.
it can’t even tell you which camera is better than another camera.
it’s not a useless number, but it is incorrect to extrapolate one camera is better than another one because of the numbers.
before going any further, don’t please don’t accuse me of being a phaseone fanboy because i’ve invested a large amount in an iq180 system.
while i don’t think iso 102,400 will be of much use, it looks really good at 12,800.
when it comes to the low light iso test, the nikon wins handily.
the d3x is/was a terrific camera but the price was way out of reach for most.
my subjects rarely move so i can expose monument valley for 1/10th of a second at iso 35 on my rock steady tripod rather than cranking up the iso.
if you do, you haven’t been following my blog, otherwise you would know i don’t do that.
in real world usage you won’t see the 14.3 stops of the d800 because a s/n ratio of 1:1 won’t make anyone happy.
they’re probably hasn’t been a dslr made in 5 years that doesn’t beat the iq180 when used at it’s optimal resolution.
but i’ll also admit that few need what i’m after, which is sheer resolution so i can make very large prints (we’re talking 70-90″) from a single file if i want to.
here i go again with asubjective point of view … in fact comparing these two cameras is like trying to compare apples to oranges.
the three are listed as “landscape” which is based on overall maximum dynamic range, “portrait” which is based on color depth, and “sports”, which is based on low light iso performance.
this is the ceiling of the sensors dynamic range.
i have a sony nex system that i use for that other stuff.
of course, in the real world no one buys a medium format system if they need low light shooting capabilities.
i’ll let you know when i finish, and  you can stop by and pixels and see the prints for yourself.
what dxo has proven is sony knows how to make sensors and the new sensor in the d800 is the most modern and perhaps best sensor technology around.
it is filed underarticles & reviews, blog, capture.
it can’t even tell you which camera is better than another camera.
from the dxo graphs you can see how the dynamic range decreases as the iso increases, because this process adds noise and thus raises that floor faster than the signal amplification can raise the ceiling.
i suppose they were afraid of cannibalizing the d3x … but hard to cannibalize sales of something that hardly anyone bought.
i think it’s a fantastic camera.

the d800 wins the dynamic range test by a little, but then both are outstanding.
sensor resolution, lens sharpness and contrast, tripod stability, diffraction from the aperture, lens shade to cut down flare (all the time, not just when you think a light is hitting the lens.), a uv filter in front of the lens, aa filter (d800) or not (d800e), iso, post post processing … all this and more affects actual real world results and defines how good your files will look when printed.
thankfully for nikon shooters that’s in the past and this new camera appears to be fantastic and very reasonably priced.

we don’t know where the 5d mark iii sensor will fall, but it’s also a new generation and it will be close, and better at higher iso’s.
when this happens to a sensel in a camera the result is a blown pixel in a file.
at what point does too much light reach the sensor so the sensels recording the dress saturate, meaning the camera can no longer record the difference between the subtle variations in white which provide the detail in the dress.
i think it’s important to put dxo into perspective, because it can’t tell you what camera is best for you.
not much point in comparing 100% screen crops since no one looks at images that way.
so comparing a d700 to a d800, (which have cmos sensors) might be somewhat useful, but comparing a d800 to a sigma (foveon sensor) or a medium format back such as the phaseone iq180 (which a ccd sensor) is less useful.
i think it’s a fantastic camera.
sure you may shoot the same kind of things, but chances are you shoot other stuff too.
the basic premise of the test is to provide an indicator of how well a sensor can differentiate between light levels as well as differentiate between color levels.
the other factor is noise, and what dxo measures is the ratio of signal (light) to the noise.
this is especially true when you aren’t comparing similar sensors and similar bodies.
what you find is once you start to make sense of it, you realize dxo numbers like this aren’t very useful in any real world comparison.
same thing applies to the iq180 … except at lowest iso levels a ccd sensor seems to do a little better, so real world performance there’s a good chance the two will be virtually identical.
but if i wanted to be the “king” of dxo, i could design a camera with about 8 megapixels on a full frame sensor using all the same technology sony has used to create the sensor in the d800.
and in fact what may be unacceptable in one type of photography, perhaps a landscape, may not be a problem at all with other types of photography, say sports.
sorry, the 8mp sensor would win, because using similar technology, larger pixels will result in cleaner results and a higher number in dxo. but who wants to shoot with an 8mp camera?
i know what my definition is and what i’m trying to get out of my equipment, and despite those tremendous 36mp of the nikon, without even testing it i can tell you to me it’s not better.
so this “acceptable” level of noise at the bottom becomes the “floor” of the dynamic range.
you can follow any responses to this entry through therss 2.0 feed.
that’s difficult because it’s created by engineers and is really an engineering standard.
all it can do is provide a numerical rating which is only applicablewithin the context of it’s own parameters, which few really take the time to figure out.
sure i can shoot those types of  things, but it’s not the best tool.
saturation of a sensel means it can no longer tell if more light is coming in.
we don’t know where the 5d mark iii sensor will fall, but it’s also a new generation and it will be close, and better at higher iso’s.
what dxo has proven is sony knows how to make sensors and the new sensor in the d800 is the most modern and perhaps best sensor technology around.
considering the same sensor in a sony camera went for about $3k, nikon could have easily hit the price point.
unfortunately those which do so show how little they understand what dxo measures.
old articles dxo tests show nikon d800 is better than a phaseone iq180!
we all know that sheer number of pixels isn’t the only important thing, because the quality of those pixels can be dramatically different.
the bottom end of a sensor range is when this signal to noise ratio gets to the point the noise overwhelms the signal and you can no longer distinguish different levels of light.
what may be acceptable noise in dark shadow detail to one person may be unacceptable to another.

i think it’s important to put dxo into perspective, because it can’t tell you what camera is best for you.
the iq180 wins the color depth test by a small amount, but again both are outstanding.
but then even if the canon happens to better the nikon with the dxo tests, everything i’ve written applies – the number really doesn’t mean much.
this is true of any of the cameras they measure … real world results for all of these cameras will be a few stops less than the dxo rating.

dxo is trying to quantify the ability of the sensor to record light in comparison to other sensors.

the precision of the photographers technique (the craft part of photography) will have far more bearing on the final image quality than a small amount of increased dynamic range.
technique is the real king … the precision of the photographers technique (the craft part of photography) will have far more bearing on the final image quality than a small amount of increased dynamic range.
the iq180 is great for landscape shooters, high end commercial shooters, fashion shooters, architectural shooters who want to use it on a view camera.
but i’ll also admit that few need what i’m after, which is sheer resolution so i can make very large prints (we’re talking 70-90″) from a single file if i want to.

you probably don’t use a tripod all the time, i don’t think i have single shot from my iq180 that wasn’t taken on a tripod.

everything in the capture chain counts, not just the sensor sensitivity.
the three are listed as “landscape” which is based on overall maximum dynamic range, “portrait” which is based on color depth, and “sports”, which is based on low light iso performance.
some claim, based on the dxo overall rating of 95, it means the d800 is better than the phaseone iq180 (an 80mp medium format sensor), which “only” scores a 91.
before going any further, don’t please don’t accuse me of being a phaseone fanboy because i’ve invested a large amount in an iq180 system.
i can’t wait to get out on a shoot with one.

to give you an idea how the numbers don’t correlate to a useful real world number, if you look at the criteria used by dxo to determine their rating, resolution is not a factor.
