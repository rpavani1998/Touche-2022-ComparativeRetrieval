nonetheless, both cameras are excellent.
i’m canon shooter converting to nikon, but that does not take away excellent quality of either.
mitch not only hdmi out from the 800d but also uncompressed full 1080p from the hdmi.
i apologize for making the errors… it has been an awful long week.
no need to apologize to lazy a55 jerks who cannot do anything other then crib like little 8itches and pick on some small errors.
thanks for your work so far mitch.

mar, 2012 d800 also has in-camera hdr, ae lock and a self cleaning sensor.
i have invested “a coin or two” in canon glass, but that is no issue at all – i’m going to sell them all with basically no loss and buy equivalent nikon alternatives.
also on the battery grip you right extra on the d800 and on the canons you wright the model names, or write extra on all or write model names on all.
i really like the sound of the pixel based metering of d800, time-lapse support, higher pixel count, built-in flash (for fill) water-resistance, and potential to use an f4 lens with 2x and still get af.
reply to this comment d800 has multible exposures up to 9 and hdr mode, get your info right well-loved.

mar, 2012 except things already mentioned above, there is also an ethernet port available on d800.
yes metering: ttl exposure metering using 91k (91,000)-pixel rgb sensor memory cards: sd (secure digital) and ; type i compactflash memory cards (udma compliant) battery: li-ion en-el15 battery horizon level: dual axis levelling well-loved.

mar, 2012 by planetmitch in 5d mk ii, 5d3, d800 one of the first things people start doing when a new camera like the canon eos 5d mark iii is announced is compare it to other cameras in its class… so we knew you’d want that
please fix this because your blog give out an inacurate image.
mar, 2012 mitch the d800 also has horizon level, aperture control in video , uncompressed hdmi out, also on timelalse it edits the images and outputs a final video.

reply to this comment - autofocus points: 51 points, 9 at f/8 - video recording format: h.264/mpeg-4 avc - battery grip: mb-d12 optional other factors that could be included is the: - price and any thing else that could be added.
the 14-24mm lens and 24-120 cover most options for me as a photo-journalist.

mar, 2012 correct me if i am wrong but i believe the d4 has the ethernet port but the d800 doesn’t.

absolutely no doubts 5dmk3 will take amazing pictures, just the same applies to d800 (maybe save for iso12800 which might be better on canon due to pixel size but that doesn’t bother me at all as i rarely see iso1600).
shame on this website for blowing chunks though.
mar, 2012 do not worry mitch, i also blief that you are a canon shutter so there is a chance you will look more for the canon information.

a few more - autofocus points: 51 points, 9 at f/8 - video recording format: h.264/mpeg-4 avc - battery grip: mb-d12 optional - battery: en-el15 other factors that could be included is the: - price - wb bracketing - connectivity, i.e. usb and any thing else that could be added.
usb 3 also seems like a great idea, shame my mac doesn’t offer it too.
both cameras appear to be fantastic and we are all winners.

yes when you compare some cameras maybe you want to give an extra 5 to 10 minutes to get the specs from the manufacturer.
i’m absolutely convinced in both, just d800 fits better for me and seems to be better value for the money.
ps: nobody is really locked in platform.

we thought about throwing in the canon eos-1d x and the nikon d4, but those are approximately $3,000 more so they’re in a different class.

this alone help me to make a change, moving to sony or nikon, may be a fs100 that i can get a adapter or just sell all fo my canon lenses and move to kikon, because of the size of the sensor i belief i am moving to nikon and just them after a fs100 replacement go back to video cameras.

both 5d mk iii & d800 are fantastic cameras, they both excel at some features and lack at others – thus providing specific needs of specific market segments.
