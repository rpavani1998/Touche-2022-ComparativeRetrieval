you can also opt to have the source images saved along with the hdr shot, so if you're not satisfied with the result achieved in-camera, you can reprocess the hdr on your computer.
dual card slots mean that the 5d mark iii can now record to either udma 7 compactflash or secure digital cards, including sdhc and sdxc.
as in the eos 7d, there's an on-demand grid function, and you can also display the locations of the 61 focusing points.

although the target market is clearly experienced photographers, the 5d mark iii caters to the occasional time when you want to lend your camera to a less-experienced photographer, perhaps to get in the shot yourself.
a 'silent' shooting mode reduces operation noise, but reduces burst-shooting speed to three frames per second.
interestingly--and unsurprisingly--the d4 does a little better with the red leaf swatch at iso 100, but misses the texture of the pink swatch beneath.
the remaining points are horizontal line-types, sensitive to f/5.6.
the superior resolution of the sony a77 is lost a bit to noise suppression in the smaller sensor, particularly noticeable in the shadows and the dark mosaic background.

the 5d mark iii renders the pink swatch a little more magenta than it should.
menu and info buttons are well-placed on the upper left side of the lcd.

battery life is rated to cipa testing standards at 950 shots with the viewfinder, or 200 shots in live view mode, at 73°f / 23°c.
the canon 5d mark iii's image is quite smooth, though, offering very similar levels of detail.
today's iso 3,200 is yesterday's iso 1,600 (well, almost), so below are the same crops at iso 3,200.
finally, the new speedlite 600ex-rt costs us$630 or thereabouts, and the new st-e3-rt transmitter is priced at approximately us$470.
although the target market is clearly experienced photographers, the 5d mark iii caters to the occasional time when you want to lend your camera to a less-experienced photographer, perhaps to get in the shot yourself.
thanks to its full-frame sensor, there's no focal length crop.
for video mode, the upper limit is capped at iso 25,600 equivalent.
interestingly, as well as using the secondary card as an overflow or duplicate, or to segregate by file type, you can also record different raw or jpeg types to each card.
the 5d mark iii also offers up a multiple exposure function.
(you can also adjust iso sensitivity, shutter speed, and aperture as the video is captured.)
the eos 5d mark iii's body includes weather-sealing to a level said to be better than that of the 5d mark ii, but not to the same degree as an eos 1-series body like the eos-1d x.
the top deck includes a mode dial with the auto+ mode, combined from the creative auto and green zone modes on the 5d mark ii.
of course, there's still a monochrome status display on the top deck, as well.
just like the 1d x, you can combine up to nine frames into a single exposure in-camera.
these images are best quality jpegs straight out of the camera, at default settings including noise reduction.
dual card slots mean that the 5d mark iii can now record to either udma 7 compactflash or secure digital cards, including sdhc and sdxc.

while the 5d mark iii has slightly better detail in higher contrast subjects, the d4 renders the troublesome red swatch as if it were no problem at all.
the 5d mark iii uses a new bg-e11 battery grip, which includes a duplicate multi-controller for portrait shooting.
as well as the previously-mentioned microphone and headphone jacks, the 5d mark iii also offers up a pc sync terminal, combined standard-def av output / usb 2.0 high speed port, wired remote control port, and high-def hdmi video output.
we shot some videos to illustrate the canon 5d mark iii's various new features, as well as a video of how the canon 600ex rt's radio flash works with the 5d mark iii.
the shutter mechanism is rated as good for 150,000 shots, unchanged from the 5d mark ii.
of the latter, five will work as high-precision points to f/2.8.
the 5d mark iii renders the pink swatch a little more magenta than it should.
remote camera triggering is possible from a flash strobe.
the mode dial has a central locking button, as seen on the 60d. (this was also available as an option on the 7d and 5d mark ii, but here it's the default.)
the 5d mark ii's images look downright hazy by comparison.
the 600ex-rt has a guide number of 60 meters / 197 feet at maximum zoom, and has a zoom range of 20 to 200mm.
among the user requests that canon has heard and answered with the 5d mark iii, there's now a side-by-side comparative playback display (including synced magnification and a histogram function), plus the ability to manually set the first four characters of image file names.
the top deck includes a mode dial with the auto+ mode, combined from the creative auto and green zone modes on the 5d mark ii.
all three accessories ship from april 2012.
the mode dial has a central locking button, as seen on the 60d. (this was also available as an option on the 7d and 5d mark ii, but here it's the default.)
the 5d mark iii's 63-zone dual-layer ifcl metering sensor was first seen in the eos 7d.
also, because the 5d mark iii is a beta unit, keep in mind image quality may not be representative of final production models.
there's a new wft-e7a wireless file transmitter that also supports the eos 7d and 60d, and includes 802.11a/b/g/n wi-fi and gigabit ethernet.
this full-color metering allows better subject detection, information which is also fed back to the autofocus system to further aid subject tracking.
for the first time in an eos model other than the 1-series, the 5d mark iii can now capture 2, 3, 5, or 7 shots in a bracketed sequence.
like the 1d x, there's a 3.2-inch clear view ii lcd panel with a high resolution of approximately 1,040,000 dots.
of the latter, five will work as high-precision points to f/2.8.
even so, keeping with canon tradition, many buttons have shuffled around, and new ones created.
finally, the new speedlite 600ex-rt costs us$630 or thereabouts, and the new st-e3-rt transmitter is priced at approximately us$470.
canon 5d mark iii versus canon 7d at iso 100 canon 5d mark iii at iso 100 canon 7d at iso 100 18 to 22 megapixels isn't that large a difference, but it's clear that the 5d mark iii is able to resolve a little more detail.
the 5d mark iii has slightly improved contrast and certainly more resolution.
canon 5d mark iii versus sony a77 at iso 100 canon 5d mark iii at iso 100 sony a77 at iso 100 the 5d mark iii does well against sony's 24-megapixel a77, though we found the a77 to be a little less sharp than the nex-7.
