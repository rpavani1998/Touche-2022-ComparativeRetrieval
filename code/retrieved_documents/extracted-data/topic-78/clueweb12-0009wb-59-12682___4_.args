mergesort also takes advantage of pre-existing order, so it would be favored for using sort() to merge several sorted arrays.mergesort also takes advantage of pre-existing order, so it would be favored for usingsort() to merge several sorted arrays.a stable sort means that for records that compare equal, the original input ordering is preserved.that means that simple numerical and lexical sorts do not profit from stability, since equal elements are indistinguishable.on average, mergesort does fewer comparisons than quicksort, so it may be better when complicated comparison routines are used.on the other hand, quicksort is often faster for small arrays, and on arrays of a few distinct values, repeated many times.the default algorithm is mergesort, which will be stable even if you do not explicitly demand it.however, with a comparison such as { substr($a, 0, 3) cmp substr($b, 0, 3) } stability might matter because elements that compare equal on the first 3 characters may be distinguished based on subsequent characters.in perl 5.8 and later, quicksort can be stabilized, but doing so will add overhead, so it should only be done if it matters.however, with a comparison such as - { substr($a, 0, 3) cmp substr($b, 0, 3) } stability might matter because elements that compare equal on the first 3 characters may be distinguished based on subsequent characters.you can force the choice of algorithm with this pragma, but this feels heavy-handed, so the subpragmas beginning with a_ may not persist beyond perl 5.8.you can force the choice of algorithm with this pragma, but this feels heavy-handed, so the subpragmas beginning with a _ may not persist beyond perl 5.8.note that no sort "_quicksort"; have exactly the same effect, leaving the choice of sort algorithm open.note that - no sort "_quicksort"; - no sort "_mergesort"; have exactly the same effect, leaving the choice of sort algorithm open.with the sort pragma you can control the behaviour of the builtin sort() function.
