that way you aren’t actually modifying the original object.
the octave consists of twelve semi-tones, in which the major scale is set in this pattern: whole tone, whole tone, semitone, whole tone, whole tone, whole tone, whole tone, semi-tone.
["c",  "g", "d", "a", "e", "b/cb",  "f#/gb", "c#/db", "g#/ab", "d#/eb",  "a#/bb", "e#/f"] hooray.
if a scale has 3 sharps, it’s a. period.
say it with me now: “ruby passes objects by reference.
again, if you’re interested enough in the topic that you’re still working out this algorithm, fire up irb and just try it out, it will make more sense as you do so.
tmp is now just a reference straight to sequence, so altering tmp modifies sequence as well.
the thing that makes it seem so strange is, at least in part, the major  scale.
i decided to write them out in ruby and run some simple benchmarks, just for fun.
the second chapter of introduction to algorithms by cormen, leiserson, et al., describes the algorithms for insertion sort and merge sort in pseudocode, and compares their relative efficiency (or lack thereof).
this is actually really cool; each scale, in addition to being unique in that, well, it has a different root note, is unique in that it is the only scale to have its specific number of sharps or flats.
that doesn’t mean a whole lot.
i don’t have any startling conclusions to close this off with.
just  that music is pretty cool, and that a few of the things thatseem arbitrary just have to be that way – assuming we’re going to base  the system around 12 equally tempered semitones (seeequal temperment, or even

we’ll take a root note as an argument, so we can construct any major  scale we like.
there isn’t another choice.
fun with the major scale aug 11th, 2010 got to chatting with nate (@fowlduck) about musical notation last night.
it just got me thinking about the major scale and the circle of fourths & fifths, which led to some playing around on the command line, which led to this.
well, let’s make a little  method to construct a major scale from the@notes variable.
here’s a version modeled after the pseudocode in intro to algorithms: def merge_sort(sequence, first, last) if first  1, it calculates a midpoint; integer division works fine for this, using (first + last) / 2.
[1,2,3,4,5,6] > shiftit(h) => {:bar  =>"baz",:baz=>"qux"} > shiftit(a) =>
our original objects were changed when they were modified inside the method.
gcd is a recursive function, basically euclid’s algorithm for finding the greatest common denominator.
let’s just say it would take awhile.
i write like: h.p. lovecraft.
insertion sort (medium_array): 23.960000 0.010000 23.970000 ( 24.096455)
a : gcd(b, a % b) end def rp(a, b) gcd(a, b) ==
i could alter it, still: if i changed the reassign method so  that it didobj.replace("some new value!") inside the  method body, the original object would be changed, just likeshiftit did to the array and the hash.

that part, to me at least, does seem arbitrary, but effectively it  doesn’t matter.

now even the merge_sort shows its limits, taking over a minute, about 74.3 seconds.

even when i realized this was happening, i still made the mistake of just doing tmp = sequence on my first try.
where it gets really interesting is the circle of fourths and fifths.
the small array is pretty fast for all three methods, but even still, we can see that merge_sort is alittle faster, and the built in .sort!
so instead, ruby figures that i want a local variable that is also named foo, inside my method scope, and it assigns my new  value to the localfoo, not the original foo.
so, let’s just accept the scale as a given; that  this pattern of whole tones and semi-tones sounds pleasing to the ear.
[] tmp.each do |element|
a sharp or flat is added or removed each increment you  go around the circle.
i could alter it, still: if i changed the reassign method so that it did obj.replace("some new value!") inside the method body, the original object would be changed, just like shiftit did to the array and the hash.
i write like: cory doctorow.
it looks like: def q(s);t=s.dup;t.size= pivot sub_sequence_a =
if you go around  clockwise, each scale has one additional sharped note until you get to 180  degrees around, then it has n-1 flat notes, and loses one flat each fifth till  you get back to c (no sharps or flats); vis versa the other direction.
(0..11).map{|n|  @notes[(n+root)%12]} ?
well, the main reason is that both of these methods are significantly slower than good old array::sort, which is built in to ruby (and which, as far as i know, is implemented using thequicksort algorithm).
a ten thousand element array starts to show the difference even more dramatically: insertion_sort now takes 24.1 seconds, close to half a minute, while the merge_sort still runs in under a second.
["c", "g", "d", "a", "e", "b/cb", "f#/gb", "c#/db", "g#/ab", "d#/eb", "a#/bb", "e#/f"] hooray.
for one, we want to be able to express every scale  by naming off the notes, and we’d like each note to be a different  letter.
the semi-tone before or after any given note  is a flat or a sharp respectively, giving rise to the b
in eb, the note  following g is ab… and so on.
that part, to me at least, does seem arbitrary, but effectively it doesn’t matter.
if you’re bothering to read this and it still isn’t clear, just run the sort locally and add some puts statements liberally so you can see what’s going on.
ruby must notreally be passing a referece, right?
he  was pointing out that bits of the notation seem arbitrary and probably archaic,  likening it to legacy code of a sort.
(i’m making it an instance variable so i can use it in a method later; this was all done in irb.)
like so: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 | c | | d | | e | f | | g | | a | | b | c | ... (etc) the next root note (13th semi-tone, above) is only a semi-tone off from the last note of the scale.
insertion sort (bigger_array): 0.240000 0.000000 0.240000 ( 0.238994) merge sort (bigger array): 0.030000 0.010000 0.040000
(0..11).map{|n| n*7%12 }
[0,1,2,3,4,5] uhm, hopefully that’s clear.
when  i tell ruby thatfoo = "bar", ruby binds the local  variable namedfoo to a string object, “bar”.
"e#/f g a a#/bb c d e"
that’s a good question.
first lets set it up: > circle =
if you go around clockwise, each scale has one additional sharped note until you get to 180 degrees around, then it has n-1 flat notes, and loses one flat each fifth till you get back to c (no sharps or flats); vis versa the other direction.
(again), way faster, only 0.00016 seconds.
the same noteletter only appears once in any given scale.
so we said that the circle of fifths added a sharp each increment, and then  flipped to flats and removed on each increment.
(i’m making it  an instance variable so i can use it in a method later; this was all done in  irb.)
here were the results: user system total real small_array has 100 elements in it...

you’ll find that any method of modifying an object inside another  method with actually change (even delete, if you go that far) the original  object that you passed in.
it just got me thinking  about the major scale and the circle of fourths & fifths, which led to some  playing around on the command line, which led to this.

this post is not meant to be a defense of music notation, a “setting straight” of anything, or even a definitive description of musical theory (at which i’m a rank amateur).
@jmchilton, who was a ta when i took structure of computer programming i (or whatever it was called; the scheme class) at the u of m, supplied this alternative solution to the relative prime problem: def gcd(a, b); b == 0 ?
foo is a  string object, and when i pass it to myreassign method, i am  passing a reference to the real object,foo.
so, if you go around clockwise, you’re counting by fifths (g is the fifth note of the c major scale, d is the fifth note of the g major scale, etc) and if you go around counter-clockwise you’re counting by fourths (f is the fourth note of c, bb is the fourth note of f, etc).
then it calls itself recursively on each subarray; these in turn will continue splitting each subarray into two parts until it gets to the point where it’s just two subarrays of one element each; which are then fed to merge and sorted.
(using quicksort) isway faster: only 0.000016 seconds.
[offset[0], offset[2], offset[4], offset[5],  offset[7], offset[9], offset[11]].join(" ") ?> end => nil so, just calling major with no arguments should give us the c  major scale; calling with, say, 5 should give us f major (5 in this case is the  index of f in @notes; but you were already following that, i know): > major =>
the merge sort is split into two parts; a merge method that acts as a helper, and the actual merge_sort which calls itself recursively, also calling merge when needed.
let’s watch it happen: >>
foo is a string object, and when i pass it to my reassign method, i am passing a reference to the real object, foo.
h => {:bar  =>"baz",:baz=>"qux"} > a =>
{:foo=>"bar",:bar =>"baz",:baz=>"qux"}  >
h => {:bar =>"baz",:baz=>"qux"} > a =>
so, if you go around clockwise, you’re counting by fifths (g is the  fifth note of the c major scale, d is the fifth note of the g major scale, etc)  and if you go around counter-clockwise you’re counting by fourths (f is  the fourth note of c, bb is the fourth note of f, etc).

let’s just construct a reference array really quick.
i didn’t look at this until after i’d already written my versions of the insertion sort and the merge sort; their version of insertion_sort is nearly the same, but their merge sort is somewhat more succinct, and looks worth playing around with.)
g#/ab a#/bb b c#/db d#/eb f c#/db d#/eb f f#/gb g#/ab a#/bb c g#/ab a#/bb c c#/db d#/eb f g d#/eb f g g#/ab a#/bb c d a#/bb c d d#/eb f g a f g a a#/bb c d e not as neat as it could look since i put the #/b both in the original notes array; the note you’d read would be the one with a consecutive letter after the previous note.
=> nil so, assignment inside a method doesn’t change our object.
so we need 7 letters.
this time, to show what the recursion is actually doing, i’ll write out what each nested call to merge_sort( and/or merge) would actually look like: starting array: [5,2,3,1,4,0] merge_sort([5,2,3,1,4,0], 0, 5): mid <- 2 merge_sort([5,2,3], 0, 2): mid <- 1 merge_sort([5,2], 0, 1): mid <- 0 merge_sort([5], 0, 0): merge_sort([2], 1, 1): merge([5,2],0, 1, 1): left <- [5,∞] right <- [2,∞] loop(0..1): [2,5] # just showing the result in this step; the two elements are sorted.
so, just calling major with no arguments should give us the c major scale; calling with, say, 5 should give us f major (5 in this case is the index of f in @notes; but you were already following that, i know): > major =>
ruby  passes objects by reference.
no, we’re not the stupid ones =>
== 1; end or, indented: def gcd(a, b) b == 0 ?
for example, why no whole tone between b and c, e and f?

it still doesn’t necessarily seem to make sense.

so the reason this is how not to write sorting algorithms in ruby is simply that, you really probably don’t need to, unless you need something faster than a quicksort written in c. the reason, hopefully, to be playing around writing algorithms in ruby or inwhatever your favorite language happens to be, is just to understand them better.
a sharp or flat is added or removed each increment you go around the circle.

ruby passes objects by reference.
well, let’s make a little method to construct a major scale from the @notes variable.
not content to simply feed it one sample, i fed it the text from several of the posts from the archive.
but still, why structure the notes this way?
there are a variety of ways one could write the insertion sort in ruby; this is more or less an literal translation of theintro to algorithms pseudocode to ruby – it could perhaps be made a little more ruby-ish, but here’s my version: def insertion_sort(sequence) sequence[1..sequence.size].each_with_index do |j, index| i = index sequence[0..i].reverse.each do |k| break unless k > j sequence[i + 1] =
[4,∞] loop(3..4): [1,4] merge_sort([0], 5, 5): merge([1,4,0], 3, 5, 5): left <- [1,4,∞] right <- [0,∞] loop(3..5):
a : gcd(b, a % b); end; def rp(a, b); gcd(a, b)
our original objects were changed when they were  modified inside the method.
the slides can be found at rubymn-rvm.heroku.com.
in eb, the note following g is ab… and so on.
you’ll find that any method of modifying an object inside another method with actually change (even delete, if you go that far) the original object that you passed in.

i think i’m a clone, now back to the quicksort implementation i started with: the way to get around  this is to use .clone or .dup to get acopy of the object.

there are a few reasons.
[0, 7, 2, 9, 4, 11,  6, 1, 8, 3, 10, 5]
so, evidently, according to their analyses, i write most often like cory doctorow.
as the method returns from each level of recursion, each “half” of the subarray under consideration has been sorted, until it gets all the way back to the first call to merge_sort, and executes merge on each (sorted) half of the full array.
this is  actually really cool; each scale, in addition to being unique in that, well, it  has a different root note, is unique in that it is the only scale to have its  specific number of sharps or flats.

even when i realized this  was happening, i still made the mistake of just doingtmp =

then how come assignment in a method doesn’t change an  object?
the answer comes down to the idea ofbindings and scope.

well-tempered clavier (evidently there’s some dispute over whether or not bach’s intended tuning was equal or, uh, “well” tempered; i was not aware of this!)) and a 7 note major scale – neither of which are absolutely necessary, of course, and there are other ways to do it.
(0..11).map{|n| @notes[(n+root)%12]} ?
i’m going to attempt to show another example, in case that’s helpful.
so, let’s just accept the scale as a given; that this pattern of whole tones and semi-tones sounds pleasing to the ear.
so why is it c that has all natural notes (no sharps or flats)?
so for fun, we can explore the circle of fifths in the command line.
