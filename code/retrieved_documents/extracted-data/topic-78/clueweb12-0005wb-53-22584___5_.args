object-oriented programming, fundamental data structures (such as stacks, queues, sets) and data-directed design.if you've taken the computer science ap exam and done well (scored 4 or 5) or earned a good grade in a college course, programming abstractions may be an appropriate course for you to start with, but often programming abstractions (accelerated) is a better choice.programming abstractions assumes that you already have familiarity with good programming style and software engineering issues (at the level of programming methodology), and that you can use this understanding as a foundation on which to tackle new topics in programming and data abstraction.this course is the natural successor to programming methodology and covers such advanced programming topics as recursion, algorithmic analysis, and data abstraction using the c++ programming language, which is similar to both c and java.comparing algorithm, big-o notation, big-o to predict the time of execution, best/worst/average case, analysis of recursive algorithms, another example : towers of hanoi, a tabulation for different algorithms, growth patterns, application of algorithm analysis to sorting, selection sort, selection sort code selection sort, live demo: working/execution of the code, selection sort analysis, insertion sort algorithm, live demo: working/execution of insertion sort, insertion sort analysis, insertion vs selection, quadratic growth of the algorithm, merge sort, merge sort: working/execution demo, merge sort code explanation, merge sort analysis, quadratic vs linear arithmetic, sort 'race', quick sort idea partitioning for quicksort, quicksort code working/execution, quicksort code, live demo: running quicksort vs merge sort, bad split example, worst case split, what input has worst case for quick sort, live demo: running quicksort vs merge sort, different input scenarios, strategy to avoid worst case split, execution time tabulation, towards generic functions: swap, function template, example live code, template instantiation and its errors, sort template, client use of sort template sort template with callback, supplying the callback function, one last convenience: default callback function, why object oriented programming, class division, class interface in ".h"coding with linked list coding with linked list, printing the list, using recursion to print list, de-allocating the memory used for the linked list, watch the pointers: prepend function, passing pointers by reference, array vs linked list, insert in sorted (order) linked list, insert in sorted order: code, recursive insert favorites lecture 14 -
