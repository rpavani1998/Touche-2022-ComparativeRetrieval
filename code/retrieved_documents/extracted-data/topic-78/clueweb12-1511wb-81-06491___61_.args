self-ties of arrays and hashes are not supported and fatal errors will happen even at an attempt to do so.this means that they will be more robust and hopefully faster.so the 5.8 quicksort scrambles large arrays before sorting them, as a statistical defence against quadratic behaviour.for very small lists this may result in slightly slower sorting times, but in general the speedup should be at least 20%.the exec listand system listoperations now produce warnings on tainted data and in some future release they will produce fatal errors.additional bonuses are that the worst case behaviour of sort()is now better (in computer science terms it now runs in time o(n log n), as opposed to quicksort's theta(n**2)worst-case run time behaviour), and that sort()is now stable (meaning that elements with identical keys will stay ordered as they were before the sort).this algorithm is reasonably fast while producing a much better spread of values than the old hashing algorithm (originally by chris torek, later tweaked by ilya zakharevich).the quicksort divide and conquer strategy works well on platforms with relatively small, very fast, caches.quicksort has a worst case run time that can grow like n**2, so-called quadratic behaviour, and it can happen on patterns that may well arise in normal use.with these, you can implement rather advanced parsing algorithms.for example, if you reallydon't care about the order of even and odd digits, quicksort will run in o(n)time; it's very good at sorting many repetitions of a small number of distinct elements.the systemfunction and backticks operator have improved functionality and better error handling.more appropriate mechanisms for selecting the implementation exist, but they wouldn't have arrived in time to save quicksort.additional bonuses are that the worst case behaviour of sort() is now better (in computer science terms it now runs in time o(n log n), as opposed to quicksort'stheta(n**2) worst-case run time behaviour), and thatsort() is now stable (meaning that elements with identical keys will stay ordered as they were before the sort).but quicksort was rescued at the last moment because it is faster than mergesort on certain inputs and platforms.
