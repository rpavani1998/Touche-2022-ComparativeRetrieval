[561] lexicals i: lexicals outside an eval "" weren't resolved correctly inside a subroutine definition inside the eval "" if they were not already referenced in the top level of the eval""ed code.
eventually, the problem gets whittled down to one that fits in the cache, from which point it benefits from the increased memory speed.
(the case-insensitivity used to confuse the perl build process.)
this file is supposed to be used by hints file writers for architecture-wide changes (as opposed to config.over which is for site-wide changes).
the identifier "bad" is undefined.

more details are inperformance enhancements.
it does not taint the result of floating point formats anymore, making the behaviour consistent with that of string interpolation.
this version of perl detects this  brokenness and has a workaround for it.
you can now override the readline() builtin, and this  overrides also the  angle bracket operator.
the utf8:: name space (as in the pragma) provides various perl-callable functions to provide low level access to perl's internal unicode representation.
[561] the regular expression captured submatches ($1, $2, ...) are now more  consistently unset if the match fails, instead of leaving false data lying  around in them.
locale::constants, locale::country, locale::currency locale::language, and the locale::script  manpage, by neil bowers, have been added.
eastern asian perl users are now welcomed in their own languages: readme.jp  (japanese), readme.ko (korean), readme.cn (simplified chinese) and readme.tw  (traditional chinese), which are written in normal pod but encoded in euc-jp,  euc-kr, euc-cn and big5.
as a stop-gap measure to avoid people from getting frustrated at the  mysterious results (core dumps, most often), it is forbidden for now (you will  get a fatal error even from an attempt).
see the perlmod manpage modules and pragmata new modules and pragmata attribute::handlers, originally by damian conway and now  maintained by arthur bergman, allows a class to define attribute handlers.
seethe hash::util manpage.
for  example printf "%2\$s %1\$s\n", "foo", "bar"; will print "bar foo\n".
b::deparse has been significantly enhanced by robin houston.
perl used to be fragile in that signals arriving at inopportune moments could corrupt perl's internal state.
(they produce something other than "1" and "-1" when formatting 0.6 and -0.6 using the printf format "%.0f"; most often, they produce "0" and "-0".)
seen in perl 5.7 but gone now time::piece (previously known as time::object)  was removed because it was felt that it didn't have enough value in it to be a  core module.
the long deprecated uppercase aliases for the string comparison operators (eq, ne, lt, le, ge, gt) have now been removed.
because of the large number of tests, running the regression suite will  take considerably longer time than it used to: expect the suite to take up to  4-5 times longer to run than in perl 5.6.
one reason of this unfinishedness is its (currently) inherent unportability: since both package names and subroutine names may need to be mapped to file and directory names, the unicode capability of the filesystem becomes important-- and there unfortunately aren't portable answers.
[561] for perl developers, several new make targets for profiling and debugging  have been added; seethe perlhack manpage.
perl has been tested with the gnu pth userlevel thread package (  http://www.gnu.org/software/pth/pth.html ).
use of v-strings in use/require causes a (backward) portability warning.
in any case, the change will break existing code that relies on the current (ill-defined) semantics, so just avoid doing this in general.

this means that for example instead of do format() you must write do &format().
piconv is an implementation of the character conversion utility iconv, demonstrating the new encode module.
fix password routines which in some shadow password platforms (e.g. hp-ux) caused getpwent() to return every other entry.
this didn't do anything useful, as the sort was not performed.

local($tied_hash{foo})
[561] please see the perldiag manpage for more details.
infinity is now recognised as a number.
several debugger fixes: exit code now reflects the script exit code, condition "0" now treated correctly, the d command now checks line number, $.no longer gets corrupted, and all debugger output now goes correctly to the socket if remoteport is set.
the  byteorder was only sizeof(long) bytes long (1234 or 4321), but now it is  correctly sizeof(iv) bytes long, (12345678 or 87654321).
the new interpreter threads ("ithreads" for short) implementation of multithreading, by arthur bergman, replaces the old "5.005 threads" implementation.
(this problem didn't  affect windows platforms.)
just by saying use switch; you have switch and case available in perl.
the older name is still available for compatibility, but is deprecated.
unicos fixed various alignment problems that lead into core dumps either during  build or later; no longer dies on math errors at runtime; now using full quad  integers (64 bits), previously was using only 46 bit integers for speed.
each unquoted argument will be automatically quoted to protect whitespace, and any existing whitespace in the arguments will be preserved.
while some limited functionality towards this does exist as of perl 5.8.0, that is more accidental than designed; use of unicode for the said purposes is unsupported.
[561] the regular expression captured submatches ($1, $2, ...) are now more consistently unset if the match fails, instead of leaving false data lying around in them.
the undocumented pack/unpack template letters d/f have been recycled for better use: now they stand for long double (if supported by the platform) and nv (perl internal floating point type).
[561] file access tests now use current process privileges rather than the user's  default privileges, which could sometimes result in a mismatch between reported  access and actual access.
[561] "our" variables of the same name declared in two sibling blocks resulted in bogus warnings about "redeclaration" of the variables.
layers can be specified at open time via 3-arg form of open: open($fh,'>:crlf :utf8', $path) ||
the obsolete method of making a special (e.g., debugging) flavor of perl by  saying make libperl=libperld.a has been removed.
you can now override the readline() builtin, and this overrides also the  angle bracket operator.
this may cause new warnings when modules are being installed.
failed tests 128-130 op/pack...............................failed tests 25-5625 op/pow................................ op/taint..............................
the socket extension is now dynamically loaded instead of being statically  built in.
[561] lvalue subroutines can now return undef in list context.
[561] the debugger (perl5db.pl) has been modified to present a more consistent commands interface, via (commandset=580).
in sys::syslog there is now a failover mechanism that will go through alternative connection mechanisms until the message is successfully logged.
64-bit platforms and malloc if your pointers are 64 bits wide, the perl malloc is no longer being used  because it does not work well with 8-byte pointers.
amigaos perl 5.8.0 doesn't build in amigaos.
seethe tie::file manpage.
z/os (os/390) z/os has rather many test failures but the situation is actually much  better than it was in 5.6.0; it's just that so many new modules and tests have  been added.
and, for sufficiently large slices of pi, the  quicksort algorithm in perl 5.8 won't return the same results even if reinvoked  with the same input.
digest, frontend module for calculating digests (checksums), from gisle aas, has been added.
support for the clone special subroutine had been added.
$autoload, sort(), lock(), and spawning  subprocesses in multiple threads simultaneously are now thread-safe.
ambiguous range in the transliteration operator (like a-z-9) now gives a warning.
this has been reversed to be in the right order.
[561] posix::sleep() now returns the number of unslept seconds (as the  posix standard says), as opposed to core::sleep() which returns the number of  slept seconds.
this is the recommended method to build perl on vos.
vac 5.0.0.0 may produce buggy code for perl the aix c compiler vac version 5.0.0.0 may produce buggy code, resulting in  a few random tests failing when run as part of "make test", but when  the failing tests are run by hand, they succeed.
it can be used for example for vendor add-ons without disturbing perl's own library directories.
the tainting behaviour of sprintf() has been rationalized.
it  does not taint the result of floating point formats anymore, making the  behaviour consistent with that of string interpolation.
more appropriate mechanisms for selecting the implementation exist, but they wouldn't have arrived in time to save quicksort.
[561] fixed numerous memory leaks, especially in eval "".
other bugs in chdir() and cwd::cwd() have also been fixed.
but quicksort was rescued at the last moment because it is faster than mergesort on certain inputs and platforms.
(for space considerations, the largest chinese encodings have been separated into their own cpan module, encode::hanextra, which encode will use if available).
seethe win32 manpage for details.
this was caused  by perl's using the operating system libraries in a situation where the result  of the string to number conversion is undefined: now perl consistently handles  such strings as zero in numeric contexts.
see the perlunicode  manpage for details, and more additions.
ncr mp-ras is now supported.
in particular, caller() now returns a subroutine name of (unknown) for subroutines that have been removed from the symbol table.
pod::parselink, by russ allbery, has been added, to parse l<> links in pods as described in the new perlpodspec.
concatenation with the eq, substr, reverse, quotemeta, the x operator, substitution with s/// , single-quoted utf-8, should now work.
it  can be used for example for vendor add-ons without disturbing perl's own  library directories.
this was found to be an inconvenient interface, and in perl 5.8 the unicode model has completely changed: now the "unicodeness" is bound to the data itself, and for most of the time "use utf8" is not needed at all.
which 1 comes first is hard to know, since one 1 looks pretty much like any other.
/anydbm_file.t 2 512 12 2  16.67% 1 4 ../lib/
perlpod has been rewritten to be clearer and to record the best practices  gathered over the years.
use term::readkey 2.20 or later.
use utf8, almost) previously in perl 5.6 to use unicode one would say "use utf8" and then the operations (like string concatenation) were unicode-aware in that lexical scope.
since perlio is a drop-in replacement for stdio at the source code  level, this shouldn't be that drastic a change.
s2p has been completely rewritten in perl.
if using the aix native make command, instead of just "make" issue "make all".
these documents usually detail one or more of the following subjects:  configuring, building, testing, installing, and sometimes also using perl on  the said platform.
utility changes emacs perl mode (emacs/cperl-mode.el) has been updated to version 4.31.
in afs installations, one can configure the root of the afs to be somewhere  else than the default/afs by using the configure parameter
.operator or via variable interpolation, the tr/// operator now works.
use perlcc -b instead.)
made possible to propagate customised exceptions via croak()ing.
for very small lists this may result in  slightly slower sorting times, but in general the speedup should be at least  20%.
sort() arguments are now compiled in the right wantarray  context (they were accidentally using the context of thesort() itself).
this  will default in 5.10.
this may cause new warnings  when modules are being installed.
perl installation leaves libnet unconfigured; use libnetcfg to  configure it.
in case of failure please try running them manually, for example ./perl
to call the latter, qualify the call as &dump(...).
your bug report, along with the output of perl -v, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the perl porting team.
they provide the codes for various  locale standards, such as "fr" for france, "usd" for us  dollar, and "ja" for japanese.
socks support is now much more robust.
the c code has been made much more gcc -wall clean.
it is the little brother of -t: instead of dying on taint violations, lexical warnings are given.
[561] prototype(\[$@%&]) is now available to implicitly create references (useful for example if you want to emulate the tie() interface).
benchmark.t lib/memoize/t/expmod_t.t lib/memoize/t/speed.t
malformed unicode encodings (utf-8 and utf-16) cause a lot of warnings, as  does trying to use utf-16 surrogates (which are unimplemented).
see the perlunicode manpage for details, and more additions.
(they used to be aliases for d/f, but you never knew that.)
better unc path handling under ithreads.
if building threaded perl, you may get compilation warning from pp_sys.c: "pp_sys.c", line 4651.39: 1506-280 (w) function argument  assignment between types "unsigned char*" and "const void*"  is not allowed.
perl now tries internally to use integer values in numeric conversions and basic arithmetics (+ - * /) if the arguments are integers, and tries also to keep the results stored internally as integers.
in future releases of perl the forms will become fatal errors so  consider starting laundering now.
with the quicksort algorithm used to  implement perl 5.6 and earlier, the order of ties is left up to the sort.
since in many systems the standard  number parsing functions likestrtoul() and atof() seem to have bugs, perl tries to work around their deficiencies.
there is a make target "test.deparse" for trying this out.
all the openbsd specific patches (except for the installation specific ones) have been merged back to the main distribution.
it broke at some point during the  ithreads work and we could not find amiga experts to unbreak the problems.
this is caused by the characters \xff
tied hash interfaces are now required to have the exists and delete methods (either own or inherited).
it now works as documented.
this change leads to often  slightly faster and always less lossy arithmetics.
perlio is the default configuration because without it many new features of perl 5.8 cannot be used.
the following builtin functions are now overridable: each(), keys(), pop(), push(), shift() , splice(), unshift().
io is now by default done via perlio rather than system's "stdio".
examples include any platform using sfio, and compaq/tandem's nonstop-ux.
h2xs now uses devel::ppport for better  portability between different versions of perl.
[561] netbsd/threads: try installing the gnu pth (should be in the packages collection, orhttp://www.gnu.org/software/pth/), and configure with -duseithreads.
the difference between scripts and blocks is that scripts are the glyphs used by a language or a group of languages, while the blocks are more artificial groupings of (mostly) 256 characters based on the unicode numbering.
the readme file for general stuff.
the following tests are known to fail on super-ux: op/64bitint...........................failed tests 29-30, 32-33, 35-36  op/arith..............................
if you are on irix or tru64 platforms, new profiling/debugging options have  been added; seethe perlhack manpage for more information about pixie and third  degree.
this shouldn't be too difficult for module authors, however: perlio has been designed as a drop-in replacement (at the source code level) for the stdio interface.
it is now implemented using a windows message loop, and is therefore less prone to random crashes.
tie::refhash::nestable, by edward avis, allows storing hash references (unlike the standard tie::refhash)
perl56delta details the changes between the 5.005 release and the 5.6.0 release.
for example: open kid_ps, "-|", "ps", "aux" or die $!; forks the ps(1) command (without spawning a shell, as there  are more than three arguments to open()), and reads its standard output via the kid_ps filehandle.
building perl with -duseithreads or -duse5005threads now works under hp-ux  10.20 (previously it only worked under 10.30 or later).
net::ping has been considerably enhanced by rob brown: multihoming is now supported, win32 functionality is better, there is now time measuring functionality (optionally high-resolution using time::hires), and there is now "external" protocol which uses net::ping::external module which runs your external ping utility and parses the output.
(redhat linux/alpha with gcc 3.1 reported no problems, as did linux 2.4.18 with gcc 2.95.4.)
so the 5.8 quicksort scrambles large arrays before sorting them, as a statistical defence against quadratic behaviour.
instead of scalar(...) a reference to a reference now stringifies as "ref(0x81485ec)"  instead of "scalar(0x81485ec)"
it is the little  brother of-t: instead of dying on taint violations, lexical  warnings are given.
printf() and sprintf() now support parameter  reordering using the%\d+\$ and *\d+\$ syntaxes.
the output is highly customisable.
seethe extutils::makemaker manpage for more details.
-ilib ext/time/hires/hires.t tied/magical array/hash elements do not autovivify
stratus vos the native build method requires at least vos release 14.5.0 and gnu  c++/gnu tools 2.0.1 or later.
and odbm_file just coredumps.
[561+] the new bignum, bigint, and bigrat pragmas, by tels, implement transparent  bignum support (using the math::bigint, math::bigfloat, and math::bigrat  backends).
callbacks (naughtily) exiting  with "next;" instead of "return;" now work.
pod2html now understands pod written using different line  endings (pc-like crlf versus unix-like lf versus macclassic-like cr).
using chdir("") or chdir(undef) instead of explicit chdir() is doubtful.
[561] numerous memory leaks and uninitialized memory accesses have been hunted down.
new unicode properties unicode scripts are now supported.
after configure has finished, you can just say make all test and perl will be built and tested, all in perl/build/directory.
platform specific changes and fixes bsdi 4.
these are not new failures--perl 5.005_0x has  the same bugs, but didn't have these tests.
mkdir() now ignores trailing slashes in the directory name, as mandated by posix.
if one attempts the  test on a fat install (or build) the following failures are expected: ../ext/
data::dumper now has an option to dump code references using b::deparse.
[561] use of $& could trigger a core dump under some situations.
xs::typemap, by tim jenness, is a test extension that  exercises xs typemaps.
in many platforms, the vendor-supplied 'cc' is too stripped-down to build perl (basically, 'cc' doesn't do ansi c).
pack/unpack d/f recycled the undocumented pack/unpack template letters d/f have been recycled for  better use: now they stand for long double (if supported by the platform) and  nv (perl internal floating point type).
see the list::util manpage.
documentation on how to use the perl source repository has been added to porting/repository.pod.
unicode in general should be now much more usable than in perl 5.6.0 (or even in 5.6.1).
turning off "clrfness" is no longer enough to  make a stream truly binary.
support for unicode, iso-8859-1, and ascii are compiled in to the module.
however, the generated binaries continue to be incompatible with those generated by the other supported compilers (gcc and visual c++).
[561] io::socket::inet has support for the reuseport option (if your platform supports it).
for the full list of the available apis see the perlapi manpage.
this is caused by darwin's ufs not supporting  inode change time.
inclone you can do  whatever you need to do, like for example handle the cloning of non-perl data,  if necessary.
one can have unicode in identifier names, but not in package/class or subroutine names.
extutils::makemaker now uses file::spec internally, which hopefully leads to better portability.
for similar functionality, see pack('u0', ...) and pack('c0', ...).
[561] solaris 64-bitness using the sun workshop compiler now works.
on the  other hand, perl will now execute code such assystem("c:/program  files/myapp/foo.exe", @args) correctly.
seethe perlthrtut manpage for more information.
time::hires, by douglas e. wegscheid, provides high resolution  timing (ualarm, usleep, and gettimeofday).
[561] utime now supports utime undef, undef, @files to change the file timestamps to the current time.
enc2xs is a tool for people adding their own encodings to the encode module.
mime::base64, by gisle aas, allows you to encode data in  base64, as defined inrfc 2045 - mime (multipurpose internet mail extensions) .
at the moment only length() has been implemented.
[561] mac os x (or darwin) should now be able to build perl even on hfs+ filesystems.
in 5.10, it is expected to be  removed.
so, as you add more and more digits of pi, the order in which the sorted even and odd digits appear will change.
see the perldgux  manpage.
[561] current directory entries in %env are now correctly propagated to child processes.
previously dynix/ptx had problems in its configure probe for non-blocking  i/o. epoc epoc now better supported.
ndbm_file/ndbm.t 13 3328 71 59 83.10% 1-2 4 16-71  ../ext/
for example when building the tk extension for cygwin, you may get an error message saying "unable to remap".
hp-ux readme.hpux updated; configure -duse64bitall now works; now uses hp-ux malloc instead of perl malloc.
if you configure with ithreads, ext/threads/t/libc.t will fail.
this particular test stress tests thelocaltime() call  to find out whether it is threadsafe.
for more information, seehttp://www.unicode.org/ .
if your platform supports fork(), you can use the list form of open for pipes.
unicode scripts are now supported.
in general a lot of fixing has happened in the area of perl's understanding of numbers, both integer and floating point.
* perl now works on post-4.0 bsd/oses.
the 5.005 threads model (module thread) is deprecated and  expected to be removed in perl 5.10.
platform specific problems aix if using the aix native make command, instead of just "make"  issue "make all".
the iso 8859-15 locales may fail the locale test 117 in freebsd.
seethe unicode::ucd manpage.
ebcdic platforms (z/os (also known as os/390), posix-bc, and vm/esa) have been regained.
see the perlipc manpage.
unicode::ucd offers a querying interface to the unicode character database.

the main rationale was to have thread modules to  obey normal naming,thread:: (the threads and threads::shared themselves are more pragma-like, they affect  compile-time, so they stay lowercase).
seethe test::more  manpage.
you can see the correct behaviour by  replacing the 1..5 with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
since perlio is a drop-in replacement for stdio at the source code level, this shouldn't be that drastic a change.
now you will get an optional warning.
threads::shared, by arthur bergman, allows data sharing for  interpreter threads.
see also the perlio::via::quotedprint manpage.
[561] multi-line matches like "a\nxb\n" =~ /(?!\a)x/m were  flawed.
list::util, by graham barr, is a selection of general-utility list subroutines, such as sum(), min(), first() , and shuffle().
some memory-hungry perl applications like the pdl don't work well with perl's malloc.
alternatively, you may  want to use gnu make.
[561] configure no longer includes the dbm libraries (dbm, gdbm, db, ndbm) when building the perl binary.
in the ithreads model any data sharing between threads must be explicit, as opposed to the model where data sharing was implicit.
seethe perlembed manpage.
if you have cpan access (either network or a local copy such as a cd-rom) you can during specify extra modules to configure to build and install with perl using the -dextras=... option.
because perlio is now the default on most platforms, "-perlio"  doesn't get appended to the $config{archname} (also known as $^o) anymore.
posix::sigaction() is now much more flexible and robust.
if you have used that feature to disallow all but fully qualified  variables,use strict; instead.
xs::apitest, by tim jenness, is a test extension that exercises xs apis.
the gconvert macro ($config{d_gconvert}) used by perl for stringifying  floating-point numbers is now more picky about using sprintf %.*g rules for the  conversion.
[561] the perl parser has been stress tested using both random input and markov  chain input and the few found crashes and lockups have been fixed.
the only exception to this is sunos 4.x, which needs them.
the main rationale was to have all core perlio layers to have all lowercase names.
the return value of cwd::fastcwd() is now tainted.
see the perluniintro manpage for the explanation of the current model, and the utf8 manpage for the current use of the utf8 pragma.
you can see the list of changes in the 5.6.1 release (both from the 5.005_03 release and the 5.6.0 release) by readingthe perl561delta manpage.
[561] a socket handle leak in accept() has been fixed.
again, this  is not perl's fault-- the libc of mac os x is not threadsafe (in this  particular test, thelocaltime() call is found to be threadunsafe.)
carp now has better interface documentation, and the @carp_not interface has been added to get optional control over where errors are reported independently of @isa, by ben tilly.
you can regard this as totally trivial, or somewhat profound.
so the  extensions that are having problems can try configuring themselves without the  largefileness.
building extensions can fail because of largefiles some extensions like mod_perl are known to have issues with `largefiles', a  change brought by perl 5.6.0 in which file offsets default to 64 bits wide,  where supported.
package mypack; use attribute::handlers; sub wolf :attr(scalar) { print "howl!\n" } # later, in some package using or inheriting from mypack... my mypack $fluffy : wolf; # the attribute handler wolf will be called both variables and routines can have attribute handlers.
use mime::base64; $encoded =
encode, originally by nick ing-simmons and now maintained by dan kogai, provides a mechanism to translate between different character encodings.
the justification for this rests with quicksort's worst  case behavior.
unicode support on ebcdic still spotty though mostly working, unicode support still has problem spots on ebcdic  platforms.
check your shared library path, and any shared perl libraries in those  directories.
it also serves as an example of a loadable perlio layer.
glob()now returns filenames in alphabetical order the list of filenames from glob() (or ) is now by default sorted alphabetically to be csh-compliant (which is what happened before in most unix platforms).
see the perlbeos manpage (readme.beos) for more details.
perlio is now the default io is now by default done via perlio rather than system's  "stdio".
warnings relating to the use interpreter threads and their shared data have been added.
useperlcc -b instead.)
see the threads manpage, the threads::shared manpage, and the perlthrtut manpage.
hp-ux readme.hpux updated; configure -duse64bitall now works; now  uses hp-ux malloc instead of perl malloc.
seethe unicode::collate manpage.
in future releases, non-perlio aware xs modules may become completely unsupported.
a mmap layer may be available if platform supports it (mostly unixes).
it is primarily used by h2xs to enhance portability of xs modules between different versions of perl.
threads, by arthur bergman, is an interface to interpreter threads.
also, usually the system mallocs on such platforms are much better optimized for such large memory models than the perl malloc.
devel::ppport, originally by kenneth albanowski and now maintained by paul marquess, has been added.
(the whole dump() feature is to considered deprecated, and possibly removed/changed in future releases.)
a mmap layer may be available if platform supports it (mostly  unixes).
a workaround for the problem has been added.
so the 5.8 quicksort  scrambles large arrays before sorting them, as a statistical defence against  quadratic behaviour.
the warnings are being  worked on.
see installation and configuration improvements for the effects of perlio on your architecture name.
io::socket now has an atmark() method, which returns true if the socket is positioned at the out-of-band mark.
seethe perluniintro manpage for introduction and the  perlunicode manpage for details.
[561] pos() did not return the correct value within s///ge in earlier versions.
if you don't have /bin/mail, or if you have  'safe setuid scripts', or if suidperl is not installed, you are safe.
lib/ftmp-security tests warn 'system possibly insecure' don't panic.
activestate®,  komodo®, activeperl®, activepython®, activetcl®, and  stackato™ are trademarks or registered trademarks of activestate.
the older name is still  available for compatibility, but is deprecated.
use of /c in substitutions, even with /g, elicits use of /c modifier is meaningless in s///.
this affects builds with -duselongdouble.
(the perlbc  tools has been removed.
[561] io::socket::inet has support for the reuseport option (if your platform  supports it).
this implementation also allows later systems to call kill from within a signal handler.
print "exists!\n" if exists $tied_hash{foo}; as a side effect of this fix, tied hash interfaces must define the exists and delete methods.

they are now magnitudes faster, and they support various bignum libraries such as gmp and pari as their backends.
if you have used that feature to disallow all but fully qualified variables, use strict; instead.
we suggest upgrading to at least vac version 5.0.1.0, that has been known to compile perl correctly.
modules may fail to compile at all, or they may compile and work incorrectly.
the current user-visible implementation of pseudo-hashes (the weird use of  the first array element) is deprecated starting from perl 5.8.0 and will be  removed in perl 5.10.0, and the feature will be implemented differently.
regular expressions on references and overloaded scalars now work.
the unicode character database coming with perl has been upgraded to unicode 3.2.0.
[561] the perl parser has been stress tested using both random input and markov chain input and the few found crashes and lockups have been fixed.
suidperl is neither built nor installed by default.
several new tests have been added, especially for the lib and ext subsections.
at the moment onlylength() has been implemented.
according to perlbench, this change has not affected the overall speed of perl.
perl5db.t was also added to test the changes, and as a placeholder for further tests.
test::simple, by michael schwern, has basic utilities for writing tests.
apparently this problem has been fixed in the latest freebsd releases.
this is known problem with cygwin, and a workaround is detailed in here: http://sources.redhat.com/ml/cygwin/2001-12/msg00894.html one can build but not install (or test the build of) the ndbm_file on fat filesystems.
next, by damian conway, is a pseudo-class for method  redispatch.
arrays now always interpolate into double-quoted strings [561] in double-quoted strings, arrays now interpolate, no matter what.
you may get errors like 'undefined symbol "perl_get_sv"' or "can't resolve symbol 'perl_get_sv'", or the symbol may be "perl_sv_2pv".
[561] and -dr options to trace tokenising  and to add reference counts to displaying variables, respectively.
history written by jarkko hietaniemi .
this seems to be a compiler error since if compiled with gcc no core dump ensues, and no failures have been seen on the said test on any other platform.
(this happens because the test scripts from under t/lib have been moved to be closer to the library/extension they are testing.)
after years of trying, suidperl is considered to be too complex to ever be  considered truly secure.
perlio::via::quotedprint, by elizabeth mattijsen, is an example of a perlio::via class: use perlio::via::quotedprint; open($fh,">:via(quotedprint)", $path); this will automatically convert everything output to $fh to quoted-printable.
if you run sort { $a  $b } ( 1 .. $n , 1 .. $n ); (something you might approximate if you wanted to merge two sorted arrays  using sort), doubling $n doesn't just double the quicksort time, it quadruples it.
the new  algorithm "one-at-a-time" produces a different hashed key order.
the dg/ux platform now supports 5.005-style threads.
seethe test::simple manpage.
for very small lists this may result in slightly slower sorting times, but in general the speedup should be at least 20%.
core enhancements unicode overhaul unicode in general should be now much more usable than in perl 5.6.0 (or  even in 5.6.1).
[561] some "not a number" warnings introduced in 5.6.0 eliminated to be  more compatible with 5.005.
encode_base64('aladdin:open sesame'); $decoded = decode_base64 ($encoded); print $encoded, "\n"; #  "qwxhzgrpbjpvcgvuihnlc2ftzq==" see the mime::base64 manpage.
spurious syntax errors generated in certain situations, when glob() caused file::glob to be loaded for the first time, have been fixed.
some warning messages still remain in some platforms, so if you are compiling with gcc you may see some warnings about dubious practices.
a potential security vulnerability in the optional suidperl component of perl was identified in august 2000.
linux long doubles should now work (see install).
if your environment variables (lc_all, lc_ctype, lang) look like you want  to use utf-8 (any of the variables match/utf-?8/i), your stdin,  stdout, stderr handles and the default open layer (seethe open manpage) are  marked as utf-8.
the enhanced version has also been backported to earlier releases of perl and submitted to cpan so that the earlier releases can enjoy the fixes.
gccs prior to 2.95.3 are definitely not good enough, and gcc 3.1 may be even better.
this probably means that you are trying to use an  older shared perl library (or extensions linked with such) with perl 5.8.0  executable.
the suidperl functionality is likely to be removed in a future release.
z/os has rather many test failures but the situation is actually much better than it was in 5.6.0; it's just that so many new modules and tests have been added.
use tie::hash; tie my %tied_hash => 'tie::stdhash'; ... # nothing has set the foo element so far { local $tied_hash{foo} = 'bar' } # this used to print, but not now.
note that some of the net::ping tests are disabled when running under the  perl distribution since one cannot assume one or more of the following: enabled  echo port at localhost, full internet connectivity, or sympathetic firewalls.
the only remaining use of "use utf8" is when the perl script  itself has been written in the utf-8 encoding of unicode.
self-ties of arrays and hashes are not supported and fatal errors will  happen even at an attempt to do so.
perl_get_sv you may get errors like 'undefined symbol "perl_get_sv"' or  "can't resolve symbol 'perl_get_sv'", or the symbol may be  "perl_sv_2pv".
= 1; localised hash elements (and %env) are correctly unlocalised to not exist,  if they didn't before they were localised.
currently, there is no good solution for the problem, but configure now provides appropriate non-largefile ccflags, ldflags, libswanted, and libs in the %config hash (e.g., $config{ccflags_nolargefiles}) so the extensions that are having problems can try configuring themselves without the largefileness.
vms see socket extension dynamic in vms and ieee-format floating point default on openvms alpha for important changes not otherwise listed here.
the threads::shared::queue and threads::shared::semaphore were renamed as thread::queue and thread::semaphore just before 5.8.0.
term::readkey not working on win32 use term::readkey 2.20 or later.
the even and odd numbers appear in  the output in the same order they appeared in the input.
tie::array's splice method was broken.
scripts are similar to (and  superior to) unicodeblocks.
the main rationale was to have thread modules to obey normal naming, thread:: (the threads and threads::shared themselves are more pragma-like, they affect compile-time, so they stay lowercase).
you can now build a really minimal perl called microperl.
[561] some cases of inconsistent taint propagation (such as within hash values)  have been fixed.
the $config{byteorder} (and corresponding byteorder in config.h) was previously wrong in platforms if sizeof(long) was 4, but sizeof(iv) was 8.
many test suite tests still fail and the co-existence of unicode and ebcdic isn't quite settled, but the situation is much better than with perl 5.6.
this change will  probably break backward compatibility with compiled modules.
stratus vos the native build method requires at least vos release 14.5.0 and gnu c++/gnu tools 2.0.1 or later.
a workaround for the problem has been  added.
seethe perlhack manpage .
regular expression debug output (whether through use re 'debug' or via -dr) now looks better.
the (bogus) escape sequences \8 and \9 now give an optional warning ("unrecognized escape passed through").
print "exists!\n" if exists  $tied_hash{foo}; as a side effect of this fix, tied hash interfaces must define the exists and delete methods.
the behavior of system() with multiple arguments has been rationalized.
digest::md5 for calculating md5 digests (checksums) as defined inrfc 1321, from gisle aas, has been added.
perly.c, sv.c, and sv.h have now been extensively commented.
qw(a\\b) now parses correctly as 'a\\b': that is,  as three characters, not four.
the_quicksort and _mergesort subpragmas are heavy-handed ways to select the underlying implementation.
you have to recompile your xs modules.
the previous behaviour of ignoring them  by default and warning if requested was unacceptable since it, in a way,  falsely promised that the features could be used.
for example, while the script latin includes all the latin characters and their various diacritic-adorned versions, it does not include the various punctuation or digits (since they are not solely latin).
however, if you just want to sort the even digits ahead of the odd  ones, then what will sort { ($a % 2)  ($b % 2) } @digits; yield?
the in or is prefix to names used with the \p{...} and \p{...} are now almost always optional.
building perl with -duseithreads or -duse5005threads now works under hp-ux 10.20 (previously it only worked under 10.30 or later).
use pdl 2.3.4 or later.
the win32::setchildshowwindow() builtin can be used to control the  visibility of windows created by child processes.
seethe unicode::normalize manpage.
[561] pos() did not return the correct value within s///ge in  earlier versions.
[561] the debugger (perl5db.pl) has been modified to present a more consistent  commands interface, via (commandset=580).
if this seems to be the case and 'cc' does not seem to be the gnu c compiler 'gcc', an automatic attempt is made to find and use 'gcc' instead.

seethe perlio::scalar  manpage.
what this means is that in list context the functions will return  only three values, not four.
one potential failure is whether one can (or, if one can, whether it's a good idea to) link together at all binaries with different ideas about file offsets; all this is platform-dependent.
use mime::quotedprint; $encoded = encode_qp("\xde\xad\xbe\xef"); $decoded =
g_float is still available as a  configuration option.
for tests 129 and 130, the failing platforms do not comply with the ansi c
[561] the makefiles now default to the features enabled in activestate activeperl  (a popular win32 binary distribution).
[561] perl5opt with embedded spaces didn't work.
many of the new tests are of course introduced by the new modules, but still in general perl is now more thoroughly tested.
the version of berkeley db used when the perl (and, presumably, the db_file  extension) was built is now available as@config{qw(db_version_major  db_version_minor db_version_patch)} from perl and as db_version_major_cfg db_version_minor_cfg db_version_patch_cfg from c. building berkeley db3 for compatibility modes for db, ndbm, and odbm has  been documented in install.
perlio::scalar, by nick ing-simmons, provides the  implementation of io to "in memory" perl scalars as discussed above.
because of the above error, parts of the converted headers will be invisible.
socket/socketpair..............failed tests 12  ../lib/ipc/sysv.......................failed tests 2, 5-6  ../lib/warnings.......................failed tests 115-116, 118-119 the op/pack failure ("cannot compress negative numbers at op/pack.t  line 126") is serious but as of yet unsolved.
our can now have an experimental optional attribute unique that affects how global variables are shared among multiple interpreters, seeour in the perlfunc manpage.
in search::dict one can now have a pre-processing hook for the lines being searched.
this is only meant as a temporary debugging aid while securing the code of old legacy applications.
a failure (think chdir(some_function()) can lead into  unintendedchdir() to the home directory, therefore this behaviour  is deprecated.
aix dynamic loading should be now better supported.
atheos ( http://www.atheos.cx/ ) is a new platform.
universal::isa no longer caches methods incorrectly.
all bsds setting $0 now works (as much as possible; see the perlvar manpage for details).
one such known spot are the \p{} and \p{} regular expression constructs for code points less than 256: the pp are testing for unicode code points, not knowing about ebcdic.
vms see socket extension dynamic in vms and ieee-format floating point default  on openvms alpha for important changes not otherwise listed here.
[561] current directory entries in %env are now correctly propagated to child  processes.

emacs/e2ctags.pl is now much faster.
time::local::timelocal() does not handle fractional seconds anymore.
storable gives persistence to perl data structures by allowing the storage and retrieval of perl data to and from files in a fast and compact binary format.
note for code authors: if you want to enable your users to use utf-8 as their default encoding but in your code still have eight-bit i/o streams (such as images or zip files), you need to explicitly open() or binmode() with :bytes (see open in the perlfunc manpage and binmode in the perlfunc manpage), or you can just use binmode(fh)
lexicals ii: lexicals leaked at file scope into subroutines that were  declared before the lexicals.
if building perl with interpreter threads (ithreads), the getgrent() , getgrnam(), and getgrgid() functions cannot  return the list of the group members due to a bug in the multithreaded support  of unicos/mk.
[561+] the amdahl uts unix mainframe platform is now supported.
(utf-8 has not been  made the default since there are many perl scripts out there that are using  various national eight-bit character sets, which would be illegal in utf-8.)
the behavior in earlier versions of perl 5 was that arrays would interpolate into strings if the array had been mentioned before the string was compiled, and otherwise perl would raise a fatal compile-time error.
hash::util is the interface to the new restricted hashes feature.
self-ties of arrays and hashes are not supported and fatal errors will happen even at an attempt to do so.
also the long doubles support in aix should be better now.
the package; syntax (package without an argument)  has been deprecated.
a change to self-tying of globs has caused them to be recursively  referenced (see:two-phased garbage collection in the perlobj manpage).

the quicksort divide and conquer strategy works well on platforms with relatively small, very fast, caches.
with ithreads, when a new thread is created, all perl data is cloned, however non-perl data cannot be cloned automatically.
use of the gprof tool to profile perl has been documented in the perlhack manpage.
sort() arguments are now compiled in the right wantarray context (they were accidentally using the context of the sort() itself).
[561] dprofpp -r didn't work.
error file = try.c, line = 3
an optional warning is generated ("illegal character in  prototype...") but this may be upgraded to a fatal error in a future  release.
see "new unicode properties" earlier in this document for additional information on changes with unicode properties.
you can set the environment variable perl_test_net_ping to "1" (one) before running the perl test suite to enable all the net::ping tests.
if after installing perl 5.8.0 you are getting warnings about missing  symbols, for example dyld: perl undefined symbols _perl_sv_2pv _perl_get_sv you probably have an old pre-perl-5.8.0 installation (or parts of one) in  /library/perl (the undefined symbols used to exist in pre-5.8.0 perls).
it is still a useful module, though, and is available from the  cpan.
perlio allows "layers" to be "pushed" onto a file handle to alter the handle's behaviour.
safe signals perl used to be fragile in that signals arriving at inopportune moments  could corrupt perl's internal state.
if you have cpan access (either network or a local copy such as a cd-rom)  you can during specify extra modules to configure to build and install with  perl using the -dextras=... option.
several other encodings (like the rest of the iso-8859, cp*/win*, mac,  koi8-r, three variants ebcdic, chinese, japanese, and korean encodings) are  included and can be loaded at runtime.
for most uses, the frontend  filter::simple is to be preferred.
(this was a problem for example if you were mixing data from i/o and unicode data: your output might have got magically encoded as utf-8.)
the win32::setchildshowwindow() builtin can be used to control the visibility of windows created by child processes.
all regular expression compilation error messages are now hopefully easier to understand both because the error message now comes before the failed regex and because the point of failure is now clearly marked by a {bar} has been deprecated for a while.
as of november 2001 the only known vulnerable platform is linux, most likely all linux distributions.
no new syntax is involved:  the hash::util module is the interface.
(the whole dump() feature is to considered deprecated, and possibly removed/changed in  future releases.)
pod::parselink, by russ allbery, has been added, to parse  l<> links in pods as described in the new perlpodspec.
for example, system("nmake /nologo", @args) will now attempt to run the file nmake /nologo and will fail when such a file isn't found.
[561+] filter::util::call, by paul marquess, provides you with the  framework to writesource filters in perl.
[561] changed the posix character class
g_float is still available as a configuration option.
added rsignal(), whichsig(), do_join() , op_clear, op_null, ptr_table_clear(), ptr_table_free(), sv_setref_uv(), and several utf-8  interfaces to the publicised api.
attributes for my variables now handled at run-time
the documentation for the wince platform is called perlce (readme.ce in the  source code kit), to avoid confusion with the perlwin32 documentation on  8.3-restricted filesystems.
the glibc release 2.2.2 is known to have fixed the modfl() bug.
most importantly, anonymous subs used to leak quite a bit.
there is no need to  escape any of the\w characters.
see the switch manpage.
stable means that ties are broken to preserve the original order of appearance in the input array.
in other words: you just have to recompile your modules containing xs code, sorry about that.
(to be exact, the use64bitall is ignored.)
this document describes differences between the 5.6.0 release and the 5.8.0  release.
in newer aix  releases, this has been solved by linking perl with the libc_r library, but  unfortunately in aix 4.2 the said library has an obscure bug where the various  functions related to time (such astime() and gettimeofday())
h2xs now produces a template readme.
the artistic and copying files for copyright information.
threads::shared, by arthur bergman, allows data sharing for interpreter threads.
in newer aix releases, this has been solved by linking perl with the libc_r library, but unfortunately in aix 4.2 the said library has an obscure bug where the various functions related to time (such as time() and gettimeofday()) return broken values, and therefore in aix 4.2 perl is not linked against libc_r.
for  example, while the scriptlatin includes all the latin characters  and their various diacritic-adorned versions, it does not include the various  punctuation or digits (since they are not solelylatin).
the warnings issued by file::find now belong to their own category.
because perlio is now the default on most platforms, "-perlio" doesn't get appended to the $config{archname} (also known as $^o) anymore.
the module is contained within tie::refhash.
chomp() and chop() are now overridable.
class::isa, by sean burke, is a module for reporting the  search path for a class's isa tree.
reg_expand_sz keys are now allowed in registry settings used by perl.
in future releases of perl, non-perlio aware xs modules may become  completely unsupported.
in case you are still using solaris 2.5 (aka sunos 5.5), you may experience failures (the test core dumping) in lib/locale.t.
seethe tie::refhash manpage.
[561] sort() has been changed to use primarily mergesort internally as opposed to the earlier quicksort.
for (1..5) { $_++ } works without complaint.
self-tying of arrays and hashes is broken in rather deep and hard-to-fix ways.
see thesort pragma for information.
this shouldn't be too difficult for module authors,  however: perlio has been designed as a drop-in replacement (at the source code  level) for the stdio interface.
(implemented by jeffrey friedl, nick ing-simmons, and michael  schwern.)
the comparison block is now run in scalar context, and the arguments  to be sorted are always provided list context.
the perl header files no longer suppress common warnings from the microsoft  visual c++ compiler.
this behaviour may be fixed at a later date.
starting with 5.6.1, when perl now sees an @ sign in a  double-quoted string, italways attempts to interpolate an array,  regardless of whether or not the array has been used or declared already.
see http://www.cpan.org/src/5.0/sperl-2000-08-05/sperl-2000-08-05.txt for more  information.
also individual keys can be restricted so that the key cannot be deleted and the value cannot be changed.
the only exception to this is sunos 4.x, which needs  them.
the change was made to make perl more compliant with other applications like mod_perl which are using the aix native interface.
with  ithreads, when a new thread is created, all perl data is cloned, however  non-perl data cannot be cloned automatically.
in versions 5.000 through 5.003, the error was literal @example now requires backslash
the only remaining use of "use utf8" is when the perl script itself has been written in the utf-8 encoding of unicode.
file::find is now (again) reentrant.
the magic constants (e.g. 'p') have been macrofied (e.g. perl_magic_tied) for better source code readability and maintainability.
the prototypes are now checked better at compile-time for invalid syntax.
currently only printf() is tested: how to output various basic data types from xs.
this is harmless; it is caused by the getnetbyaddr() and getnetbyaddr_r() having slightly different types for their first argument.
localised tied variables no longer leak memory use tie::hash; tie my %tied_hash => 'tie::stdhash'; ... # used to leak memory every time local() was called; # in a loop, this added up.
use xml::parser 2.31 or later.
such platforms include alpha and 64-bit hppa, mips, ppc, and sparc.
(perlunicode is  more of a detailed reference and background information)
layers to be applied by default may be specified via the 'open' pragma.
seethe perlio::scalar manpage.
the compiler suite is slowly getting better but it continues to be highly  experimental.
file::glob::glob() has been renamed to file::glob::bsd_glob() because the  name clashes with the builtinglob().
a new special regular expression variable has been introduced: $^n , which contains the most-recently closed group (submatch).
you can now  install coderef handlers, 'default', and 'ignore' handlers, installing new  handlers was not atomic.
the exec list and system list operations now  produce warnings on tainted data and in some future release they will produce  fatal errors.
in double-quoted strings, arrays now interpolate, no matter what.
all thread tests of perl now work, but not without adding some yield()s to the tests, so while pth (and other userlevel thread implementations) can be considered to be "working" with perl ithreads, keep in mind the possible non-preemptability of the underlying thread implementation.
use locale::country; $country = code2country('jp'); # $country gets 'japan' $code =
if your pointers are 64 bits wide, the perl malloc is no longer being used because it does not work well with 8-byte pointers.
generating illegal unicode code points such as u+fffe, or the utf-16 surrogates, now also generates an optional warning.
glob() now returns filenames in alphabetical order the list of filenames from glob() (or ) is now by  default sorted alphabetically to be csh-compliant (which is what happened  before in most unix platforms).
[561] perltodo has been updated.
however, further security vulnerabilities are, unfortunately, always possible.
[[:blank:]] which stands for horizontal whitespace (currently, the  space and the tab).
note that the 5.005 threads are unsupported and deprecated: if you have code written for the old threads you should migrate it to the new ithreads model.
the command-line options -s and -f are now recognized on the shebang (#!) line.
the module is contained within  tie::refhash.
(this feature, like other new features that combine unicode
many of these changes have been further developed since 5.6.1 was released, those are marked [561+].
building microperl does not require even running configure; make -f makefile.micro should be enough.
devel::peek now has an interface for the perl memory statistics (this works only if you are using perl's malloc, and if you have compiled with debugging).
if you see op/pack, op/pat, op/regexp, or ext/storable tests failing in a linux/alpha or *bsd/alpha, it's probably time to upgrade your gcc.
no module; does not produce an error even if module does not have an unimport() method.
localising tied arrays and hashes is broken local %tied_array; doesn't work as one would expect: the old value is restored incorrectly.
note that the above of course is extremely disruptive for anything using the /usr/local/bin/perl.
this is not a substitute  for -t.
[561] warnings::enabled() now reports the state of $^w correctly if the caller isn't using lexical warnings.
perl now uses ieee format (t_float) as the default internal floating point format on openvms alpha, potentially breaking binary compatibility with external libraries or existing data.
ebcdic platforms (z/os (also known as os/390), posix-bc, and vm/esa) have  been regained.
use mod_perl 1.27 or higher.
perl 5.6.0 parsed m/\x{ab}/ incorrectly, leading to spurious warnings.
if perl is configured with -duse64bitall, the successful result of the  subtest 10 of lib/posix may arrive before the successful result of the subtest  9, which confuses the test harness so much that it thinks the subtest 9 failed.
the quicksort divide and  conquer strategy works well on platforms with relatively small, very fast,  caches.
it can be used to prepend site-specific directories to perl's default search path (@inc); see install for information.
cert and various vendors and distributors have been alerted about the vulnerability.
new or improved platforms for the list of platforms known to support perl, see supported platforms in  the perlport manpage.
seethe extutils::makemaker manpage for more  details.
perl (the undefined symbols used to exist in pre-5.8.0 perls).
the waitpid emulation has been improved.
this results  hopefully in more accurate numbers.
the constant and embed are probably problems in the tests (since they test perl's ability to build extensions, and that seems to be working reasonably well.)
memoize can make your functions faster by trading space for  time, from mark-jason dominus.
scripts are similar to (and superior to) unicodeblocks.
yes, much quicker  than perlretut.
the  constant and embed are probably problems in the tests (since they test perl's  ability to build extensions, and that seems to be working reasonably well.)
[561] linux previously had problems related to sockaddrlen when using accept(), recvfrom() (in perl: recv()), getpeername() , and getsockname().
local %tied_array; doesn't work as one would expect: the old value is restored incorrectly.
your bug report, along with the output of perl -v, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the perl  porting team.
the following tests are known to fail due to fundamental problems in the  5.005 threading implementation.
[561] nec super-ux is now supported.
its semantics were never that clear and its implementation even less so.
(previously only $prefix changed.)
aix dynaloading the aix dynaloading now uses in aix releases 4.3 and newer the native  dlopen interface of aix instead of the old emulated interface.
[561+] perldebtut is a perl debugging tutorial.
in aix 4.2, perl extensions that use c++ functions that use statics may  have problems in that the statics are not getting initialized.
these are now handled better.
the install file for how to build perl.
(still 16m per thread.)
pack('u0a*', ...) can now be used to force a string to utf-8.
additional bonuses are that the worst case behaviour of sort() is now better (in computer science terms it now runs in time o(n log n), as opposed to quicksort's theta(n**2) worst-case run time behaviour), and that sort() is now stable (meaning that elements with identical keys will stay ordered as they were before the sort).
the gconvert macro ($config{d_gconvert}) used by perl for stringifying floating-point numbers is now more picky about using sprintf %.*g rules for the conversion.
the pat, tr, and fold failures are genuine perl problems caused by  ebcdic (and in the pat and fold cases, combining that with unicode).
mac os x dyld undefined symbols
in search::dict one can now have a pre-processing hook for the lines being  searched.
autoloader can now be disabled with no autoloader;.
(5.7.0  came out before 5.6.1: the development branch 5.7 released earlier than the  maintenance branch 5.6)
while some limited functionality towards this does exist as  of perl 5.8.0, that is more accidental than designed; use of unicode for the  said purposes is unsupported.
the order of destroys has been made more predictable.
case 1 { print "number 1" } case "a" { print  "string a" } case [1..10,42] { print "number in list" } case (@array) { print "number in list" } case /\w+/ { print  "pattern" } case qr/\w+/ { print "pattern" } case (%hash) {  print "entry in hash" } case (\%hash) { print "entry in  hash" } case (\&sub) { print "arg to subroutine" } else {  print "previous case not true" } }
updated and improved modules and pragmata the following independently supported modules have been updated to the  newest versions from cpan: cgi, cpan, db_file, file::spec, file::temp,  getopt::long, math::bigfloat, math::bigint, the podlators bundle (pod::man,  pod::text), pod::latex
the "unrecognized escape" warning has been extended to include \8, \9, and \_.
note that support for 5.005-style threading is deprecated, experimental and practically unsupported.
[561] line renumbering with eval and #line now works.
eventually, the problem gets whittled down to one that fits in the  cache, from which point it benefits from the increased memory speed.
better chdir() return value for a non-existent directory.
thestable subpragma forces stable behaviour, regardless of algorithm.
layers can be specified at  open time via 3-arg form of open: open($fh,'>:crlf :utf8', $path)
the very dusty examples in the eg/ directory have been removed.
you can move the old perl shared library out of the way like this: cd /library/perl/darwin/core mv libperl.dylib libperlold.dylib and then reissue "make install".
( http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=34308 ) irix fails ext/list/util/t/shuffle.t or digest::md5 irix with mipspro 7.3.1.2m or 7.3.1.3m compiler may fail the list::util  test ext/list/util/t/shuffle.t by dumping core.
in addition to extract_delimited(), there are also extract_bracketed(), extract_quotelike(), extract_codeblock(), extract_variable(), extract_tagged(), extract_multiple(), gen_delimited_pat(), and gen_extract_tagged().
the story in more detail: suppose you want to serve yourself a little slice of pi.
configure -s can now run non-interactively.
this is only meant as a temporary debugging aid  while securing the code of old legacy applications.
h2xs now uses devel::ppport for better portability between different versions of perl.
building  microperl does not require even running configure;make -f makefile.micro should be enough.
since in many systems the standard number parsing functions like strtoul() and atof() seem to have bugs, perl tries to work around their deficiencies.
utf-16 and ucs-2 encoded perl files should now be read correctly.
( http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=65612 )
perlio allows "layers" to be "pushed"  onto a file handle to alter the handle's behaviour.
[561] can now send() from all threads, not just the first one.
if your existing programs depends on the underlying implementation, consider usingthe class::pseudohash manpage from cpan.
[561] the numerical comparison operators return undef if either operand is a nan. previously the behaviour was unspecified.
chop(@list) in list context returned the characters chopped in reverse order.
for  example, if you reallydon't care about the order of even and odd  digits, quicksort will run in o(n) time; it's very good at sorting many  repetitions of a small number of distinct elements.
suggestions  for new shiny examples welcome but the main issue is that the examples need to  be documented, tested and (most importantly) maintained.
it also sends the bug report  to perl.org, not perl.com.
in general, scripts are more inclusive, but not universally so.
a restricted hash is restricted to a certain set of keys, no keys outside the set can be added.
perl5db.t was also added to test the  changes, and as a placeholder for further tests.
it is primarily used byh2xs to enhance portability of xs modules between different versions of  perl.
time::hires, by douglas e. wegscheid, provides high resolution timing (ualarm, usleep, and gettimeofday).
seethe file::temp  manpage.
security vulnerability closed [561] (this change was already made in 5.7.0 but bears repeating here.)
the cure is to drop optimization level (configure -doptimize=-o2).
with these,  you can implement rather advanced parsing algorithms.
on the other hand, perl will now execute code such as system("c:/program files/myapp/foo.exe", @args) correctly.
"blank" is like c isblank(), that is, it contains only "horizontal whitespace" (the space character is, the newline isn't), and the "spaceperl" is the unicode equivalent of \s (\p{space} isn't, since that includes the vertical tabulator character, whereas \s doesn't.)
it seems that for some reason "make install" doesn't always completely overwrite the files in /library/perl.
known problems the compiler suite is still very experimental
see the scalar::util manpage.
these are not new failures--perl 5.005_0x has the same bugs, but didn't have these tests.
this did not work reliably in  previous releases.
the rules for allowing underscores (underbars) in numeric constants have been relaxed and simplified: now you can have an underscore simply between digits.
new documentation perl56delta details the changes between the 5.005 release and the 5.6.0  release.
the following independently supported modules have been updated to the newest versions from cpan: cgi, cpan, db_file, file::spec, file::temp, getopt::long, math::bigfloat, math::bigint, the podlators bundle (pod::man, pod::text), pod::latex
you won't notice this for small arrays, but you will notice it with larger arrays, and you may not live long enough  for the sort to complete on arrays of a million elements.
netbsd/sparc perl now works on netbsd/sparc.
$autoload, sort(), lock(), and spawning subprocesses in multiple threads simultaneously are now thread-safe.
in particular,caller() now  returns a subroutine name of(unknown) for subroutines that have  been removed from the symbol table.
some platforms that used to use gcvt may now resort to the slower sprintf.
non-blocking waits for child processes (or pseudo-processes) are supported via waitpid($pid, &posix::wnohang).
not  only is the current interface rather ugly, but the current implementation slows  down normal array and hash use quite noticeably.
mergesort has worst  case o(n log n) behaviour, the best value attainable.
odbm_file/odbm.t 255 65280 ?? ??
locale::constants, locale::country, locale::currency locale::language, and the locale::script manpage, by neil bowers, have been added.
so,  as you add more and more digits of pi, the order in which the sorted even and  odd digits appear will change.
see installation and configuration improvements for the effects of perlio  on your architecture name.
win32 in multi-cpu boxes, there are some problems with the i/o buffering: some  output may appear twice.
when perl is built using the native build process on vos release 14.5.0 and gnu c++/gnu tools 2.0.1, all attempted tests either pass or result in todo (ignored) failures.
(eg by reading /proc/self/exe on linux, /proc/curproc/file on freebsd) a new variable, ${^taint}, indicates whether taint mode is  enabled.
previously dynix/ptx had problems in its configure probe for non-blocking i/o. epoc epoc now better supported.
therestricted hashes interface is expected to be the replacement interface (seethe hash::util manpage).
xs::apitest, by tim jenness, is a test extension that  exercises xs apis.
because in effect storable does serialisation of perl data  structures, with it you can also clone deep, hierarchical datastructures.
[561+] perlpacktut is a pack() tutorial.
the previous behaviour of ignoring them by default and warning if requested was unacceptable since it, in a way, falsely promised that the features could be used.
note for code authors: if you want to enable your users to use utf-8 as  their default encoding but in your code still have eight-bit i/o streams (such  as images or zip files), you need to explicitlyopen() or binmode() with :bytes (see open in the perlfunc manpage and  binmode in the perlfunc manpage), or you can just use binmode(fh) (nice for pre-5.8.0 backward compatibility).
this is harmless; it is caused by the getnetbyaddr() and getnetbyaddr_r() having slightly different types for their first  argument.
[561] html files will now be installed in c:\perl\html instead of  c:\perl\lib\pod\html reg_expand_sz keys are now allowed in registry settings used by perl.
seethe devel::ppport manpage.
(previously perl always  preferred floating point numbers in its math.)
aka dec osf/1) the operating system version letter now recorded in $config{osvers}.
the information is attached to the new offsets member of the struct regexp.
extutils::constant, by nicholas clark, is a new tool for  extension writers for generating xs code to import c header constants.
other bugs inchdir() and cwd::cwd() have also been fixed.
[561] new %env entries now propagate to subprocesses.
since perl 5.8 is not binary-compatible with previous releases of perl,  configure no longer suggests including the 5.005 modules in @inc.
for developers interested in enhancing perl's unicode capabilities: almost all the ucd files are included with the perl distribution in thelib/unicore subdirectory.
unicode in package/class and subroutine names does not work
see the perluniintro manpage for the explanation of the current model, and  the utf8 manpage for the current use of the utf8 pragma.
the reuse option now has an alias, reuseaddr.
also, usually the system  mallocs on such platforms are much better optimized for such large memory  models than the perl malloc.
chop(@list) in list context returned the characters chopped in  reverse order.
[561+] the following platform-specific documents are available before the installation as readme.platform, and after the installation as perl platform: perlaix perlamiga perlapollo perlbeos perlbs2000 perlce perlcygwin perldgux perldos perlepoc perlfreebsd perlhpux perlhurd perlirix perlmachten perlmacos perlmint perlmpeix perlnetware perlos2 perlos390 perlplan9 perlqnx perlsolaris perltru64 perluts perlvmesa perlvms perlvos perlwin32
install now explains how you can configure perl to use 64-bit integers even on non-64-bit platforms.
isalnum, isalpha, and isword now  match titlecase.
during configure, the test guessing which symbols your c compiler and preprocessor define... will probably fail with error messages like cc-20 cc:
all the openbsd specific patches (except for the installation specific  ones) have been merged back to the main distribution.
the following tests may fail intermittently because of timing problems, for example if the system is heavily loaded.
perluniintro is an introduction to using unicode in perl.
caller() could cause core dumps in certain situations.
windows signal handling now works better than it used to.
perl will now first finish whatever it was doing, like finishing an internal operation (like sort()) or an external operation (like an i/o operation), and only then look at any arrived signals (and before starting the next operation).
allow a read-only string on the left-hand side of a non-modifying tr///.
[561] the numerical comparison operators return undef if either  operand is a nan. previously the behaviour was unspecified.
[561] sort() is also fully reentrant, in the sense that the sort  function can itself callsort().
perl 5.6.1  still works for amigaos (as does the 5.7.2 development release).
perlpodspec is a more formal specification of the pod format, mainly of  interest for writers of pod applications, not to people writing in pod.
(it is in fact a full implementation of sed in perl: you can use the sed functionality by using the psed utility.)
if after installing perl 5.8.0 you are getting warnings about missing symbols, for example dyld: perl undefined symbols _perl_sv_2pv _perl_get_sv you probably have an old pre-perl-5.8.0 installation (or parts of one) in /library/
[561] utime now supports utime undef, undef, @files to change the  file timestamps to the current time.
on linux platforms the /bin/mail program had an undocumented feature which when combined with suidperl gave access to a root shell, resulting in a serious compromise instead of reporting the exploit attempt.
note that the above of course is  extremely disruptive for anything using the /usr/local/bin/perl.
pod2html now allows specifying a cache directory.
some memory-hungry perl applications like the pdl  don't work well with perl's malloc.
so you really might prefer native  builds and long filenames.
this means that additional warnings may now show up when compiling xs code.
the difference between scripts and blocks  is that scripts are the glyphs used by a language or a group of languages,  while the blocks are more artificial groupings of (mostly) 256 characters based  on the unicode numbering.
handlers can be  specific to type (scalar, array, hash, or code), or specific to the exact  compilation phase (begin, check, init, or end).
[561] file::find now has pre- and post-processing callbacks.
this change may have surprising side effects because signals no longer  interrupt perl instantly.
[[.cc.]] and [[=c=]] are still recognised but now cause fatal errors.
(the perlbc tools has been removed.
[561+] right-hand side magic (gmagic) could in many cases such as string concatenation be invoked too many times.
it also correctly  changes directories when chasing symbolic links.
(basically what happens is that competing threads can corrupt shared global state, one good example being regular expression engine's state.)
no more corrupt internal state since the current  operation is always finished first, but the signal may take more time to get  heard.
this probably means that you are trying to use an older shared perl library (or extensions linked with such) with perl 5.8.0 executable.
there is a make target called "perl.gprof" for generating a gprofiled perl executable.
solaris x86 fails tests with -duse64bitint the following tests are known to fail in solaris x86 with perl configured  to use 64 bit integers: ext/data/dumper/t/dumper.............failed at test 268  ext/devel/peek/peek..................failed at test 7 super-ux (nec sx)
this is not a substitute for -t.
the story in more detail: suppose you want to serve yourself a little slice  of pi.
the compiler suite is slowly getting better but it continues to be highly experimental.
see the perldebug manpage.
allow  compiling with gcc (previously explicitly forbidden).
perl -d:module=arg,arg,arg now works (previously one couldn't  pass in multiple arguments.)
boms (byte order marks) at the beginning of perl files (scripts, modules) should now be transparently skipped.
no new syntax is involved: the hash::util module is the interface.
[561] xsubpp now supports the out keyword.
infinity is now recognized as a number.
qw(a\\b) now parses correctly as 'a\\b': that is, as three characters, not four.
(this change was already made in 5.7.0 but bears repeating here.)
b::concise, by stephen mccamant, is a new compiler backend for walking the perl syntax tree, printing concise info about ops.
since perl 5.8 is not binary-compatible with previous releases of perl, configure no longer suggests including the 5.005 modules in @inc.
use of the gprof tool to profile perl has been documented in the  perlhack manpage.
list::util, by graham barr, is a selection of general-utility  list subroutines, such assum(), min(), first() , and shuffle().
some  warning messages still remain in some platforms, so if you are compiling with  gcc you may see some warnings about dubious practices.
the worst bug (now  fixed) was that a pid of -1 would cause a wildcard search of all processes on  the system.
perlmodstyle is a style guide for writing modules.
similarly, building the digest::md5 extension has been known to fail with  "*** termination code 139 (bu21)".
tie::memoize, by ilya zakharevich, provides on-demand loaded hashes.
perl has been tested with the gnu pth userlevel thread package ( http://www.gnu.org/software/pth/pth.html ).
the re engine found in perl 5.6.0 accidentally pessimised certain kinds of  simple pattern matches.
mac os classic compilation of the standard perl distribution in mac os classic should now work if you have the metrowerks development environment and the missing mac-specific toolkit bits.
use switch; switch ($val) {
file::glob::glob() has been renamed to file::glob::bsd_glob() because the name clashes with the builtin glob().
a version of net::ping::external is available in cpan.
the  only exception is that ain prefix is required to signify a unicode  block when a block name conflicts with a script name.
you will need a thread  library package installed.
[561] file::glob now supports glob_limit constant to limit the size of the returned list of filenames.
use libwww-perl 5.65 or later.
it can now  deparse almost all of the standard test suite (so that the tests still  succeed).
myvariables now handled at run-time the my expr : attrs syntax now applies variable attributes at run-time.
this may or may not be a problem with ancient tcp/ip stacks of vms: we do not know since we weren't able to test perl in such configurations.
perl -d:module=arg,arg,arg now works (previously one couldn't pass in multiple arguments.)
the worst bug (now fixed) was that a pid of -1 would cause a wildcard search of all processes on the system.
its semantics were never that clear and its implementation  even less so.
this means that they will be more robust and hopefully faster.
the syntaxes @a->[...]
one can have unicode in identifier names, but not in package/class or  subroutine names.
(subroutine andour variables still get attributes
the (bogus) escape sequences \8 and \9 now give an optional warning  ("unrecognized escape passed through").
seethe storable manpage.
it can now deparse almost all of the standard test suite (so that the tests still succeed).
if you intend to run only on fat (or if using anydbm_file on fat), run  configure with the -ui_ndbm and -ui_dbm options to prevent ndbm_file and  odbm_file being built.
if tr/// is just counting characters, it doesn't attempt to modify its  target.
the existing behaviour when localising tied arrays and hashes is wrong, and  will be changed in a future release, so do not rely on the existing behaviour.
the system function and backticks operator have improved  functionality and better error handling.
self-tying problems self-tying of arrays and hashes is broken in rather deep and hard-to-fix  ways.
# in myfilter.pm: package myfilter; use filter::simple sub { while (my ($from, $to) =
this behaviour may be  fixed at a later date.
a number of other properties are now supported, including \p{l&} , \p{any} \p{assigned}, \p{unassigned} , \p{blank} [561] and \p{spaceperl} [561]  (along with their\p{...} versions, of course).

it also sends the bug report to perl.org, not perl.com.
this improves the portability of system(@args) by avoiding the need for windows cmd shell specific quoting in perl programs.
[561] file access tests now use current process privileges rather than the user's default privileges, which could sometimes result in a mismatch between reported access and actual access.
see  http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/at-error.html for more details about the  history here.
[561] and -dr options to trace tokenising and to add reference counts to displaying variables, respectively.
if you see op/pack, op/pat, op/regexp, or ext/storable tests failing in a  linux/alpha or *bsd/alpha, it's probably time to upgrade your gcc.
test 91 is known to fail on qnx6 (nto), because sprintf '%e',0 incorrectly produces 0.000000e+0 instead of 0.000000e+00 .
now perl postpones handling of signals  until it's safe (between opcodes).
(you should be able to modify only lvalue elements inside the loops.)
it points at some problems with the signedness handling of the c compiler, as do the 64bitint, arith, and pow failures.
this particular test stress tests the localtime() call to find out whether it is threadsafe.

this is a known bug in freebsd 4.5's readdir_r(), it has been fixed in freebsd 4.6 (seethe perlfreebsd manpage (readme.freebsd)).
seethe perlos390 manpage, the perlbs2000 manpage (for posix-bc), and the perlvmesa manpage for more information.
encode, originally by nick ing-simmons and now maintained by  dan kogai, provides a mechanism to translate between different character  encodings.
in sys::syslog there is now a failover mechanism that will go through  alternative connection mechanisms until the message is successfully logged.
cwd now has a split personality: if possible, an xs extension is used, (this will hopefully be faster, more secure, and more robust) but if not possible, the familiar perl implementation is used.
if this test fails, it indicates that your libc (c library) is not  threadsafe.
the package; syntax ( package without an argument) has been deprecated.
when there is no name conflict, you can omit the in from the block name (e.g. \p{braillepatterns}), but to be safe, it's probably best to always use the in).
removing directories with 'no lib'  now works.
utf-16 and ucs-2 encoded perl files should  now be read correctly.
the *glob{filehandle} is deprecated, use *glob{io} instead.
seethe perluniintro manpage for more information about utf-8.
see "new unicode properties" earlier in this document for  additional information on changes with unicode properties.
\$bar[1] will assign undef to $bar[1] (assuming that it didn't exist before), but for  tied/magical arrays and hashes such autovivification does not happen because  there is currently no way to catch the reference creation.
this will be changed in a future release, but we don't know yet what the new  semantics will exactly be.
since there are not that many amiga developers available, we could not get this fixed and tested in time for 5.8.0.
perlclib documents the internal replacements for standard c library  functions.
irix numerous compilation flag and hint enhancements; accidental mixing of  32-bit and 64-bit libraries (a doomed attempt) made much harder.
the unicode character database coming with perl has been upgraded to  unicode 3.2.0.
/lib/math/bigint/t/with_sub.t 1628 4 0.25% 9 12 1627-1628 ../lib
the utf8:: name space (as in the pragma) provides various  perl-callable functions to provide low level access to perl's internal unicode  representation.
previous versions of perl and some readings of some sections of camel iii  implied that the:raw "discipline" was the inverse of :crlf.
math::bigrat for big rational numbers, to accompany math::bigint and math::bigfloat, from tels.
also, $config{byteorder} is now computed dynamically--this is more robust with "fat binaries" where an executable image contains binaries for more than one binary platform, and when cross-compiling.
[561] pack() / unpack() can now group template letters with () and then apply repetition/count modifiers on the groups.
perl  5.6.1 still works for amigaos (as does the 5.7.2 development release).
the long deprecated uppercase aliases for the string comparison operators  (eq, ne, lt, le, ge, gt) have now been removed.
file handles can be opened to "in memory" files held in perl scalars via: open($fh,'>', \$variable) ||
it will be called in the context of the new  thread, so all modifications are made in the new area.
the rationale is that neither does localtime(), and timelocal() and localtime() are supposed to be inverses of each other.
you can see the list of changes in the 5.6.1 release (both from the  5.005_03 release and the 5.6.0 release) by readingthe perl561delta manpage.
digest::md5 for calculating md5 digests (checksums) as defined  inrfc 1321, from gisle aas, has been added.
in sdbm_file on dosish platforms, some keys went missing because of lack of support for files with "holes".
if this seems to be the case and 'cc'  does not seem to be the gnu c compiler 'gcc', an automatic attempt is made to  find and use 'gcc' instead.
many of the bug fixes in 5.8.0 were already seen in the 5.6.1 maintenance release since the two releases were kept closely coordinated (while 5.8.0 was still called 5.7.something).
the behavior of system() with multiple arguments has been  rationalized.

this is admittedly not a clean solution, and the solution may  not even work at all.
the english module can now be used without the infamous performance hit by saying use english '-no_match_vars'; (assuming, of course, that you don't need the troublesome variables @last_match_start and @last_match_end english aliases for $`, $&, or $'.)
see the i18n::langinfo manpage.
the socketpair tests are known to be unhappy in sco 3.2v5.0.4: ext/socket/socketpair.t...............failed tests 15-45 solaris 2.5

lexicals ii: lexicals leaked at file scope into subroutines that were declared before the lexicals.
or on already opened handles via extended binmode: binmode($fh,':encoding(iso-8859-7)'); the built-in layers are: unix (low level read/write), stdio (as in previous  perls), perlio (re-implementation of stdio buffering in a portable manner),  crlf (does crlf  "\n" translation as on win32, but available  on any platform).
also individual keys can be restricted so that the key  cannot be deleted and the value cannot be changed.
installperl now outputs everything to stderr.
10 1 10.00% 4 op/flip.t 15 1 6.67% 15 these failures are unlikely to get fixed as 5.005-style threads are  considered fundamentally broken.
this change may have surprising side effects because signals no longer interrupt perl instantly.
pl are now checked for sanity much more carefully than before.
if perl is configured with -duse64bitall, the successful result of the subtest 10 of lib/posix may arrive before the successful result of the subtest 9, which confuses the test harness so much that it thinks the subtest 9 failed.
seethe perlfork manpage for details.
the obsolete chat2 library that should never have been allowed to escape  the laboratory has been decommissioned.
for tests 129 and 130, the failing platforms do not comply with the ansi c standard: lines 19ff on page 134 of ansi x3.159 1989, to be exact.

the same problem affects slicing over non-existent indices/keys of a tied/magical array/hash.
db-recno.t 149 3  2.01% 61 63 65
this improvement is only available on vms v6.0 and  later.
the obsolete method of making a special (e.g., debugging) flavor of perl by saying make libperl=libperld.a has been removed.
[561] wait(), waitpid(), and backticks now return the  correct exit status under windows 9x.
(bsd_glob() does still sort platform natively, ascii or ebcdic, unless glob_alphasort is specified.)
seethe perlunicode manpage, the utf8 manpage, and http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr16/ for more information.
libnetcfg has been added to configure libnet.
the perl5opt environment variable (for passing command line arguments to  perl) didn't work for more than a single group of options.

gcc needs to closely track the operating system release to avoid build  problems.
carp  was sometimes affected by this problem.
the older methods, which  build miniperl, are still available.
the arguments of writemakefile() in makefile.
guidelines of how to construct minimal perl installations have been added to install.
perlio::via, by nick ing-simmons, acts as a perlio layer and wraps perlio layer functionality provided by a class (typically implemented in perl code).
the perlio::scalar and perlio::via (capitalised)  were renamed asperlio::scalar and perlio::via (all  lowercase) just before 5.8.0.
seethe pod::text::overstrike  manpage.
in versions 5.000  through 5.003, the error was literal @example now requires backslash
another change related to the architecture name is that "-64all"  (-duse64bitall, or "maximally 64-bit") is appended only if your  pointers are 64 bits wide.
(utf-8 has not been made the default since there are many perl scripts out there that are using various national eight-bit character sets, which would be illegal in utf-8.)
* perl now works on post-3.0 freebsds.
[561] "our" variables of the same name declared in two sibling blocks  resulted in bogus warnings about "redeclaration" of the variables.
warnings relating to the use of the new restricted hashes feature have been  added.
(they used to be aliases for d/f, but  you never knew that.)
see the threads manpage, the  threads::shared manpage, and the perlthrtut manpage.
the exploit attempt reporting feature has been completely removed from perl  5.8.0 (and the maintenance release 5.6.1, and it was removed also from all the  perl 5.7 releases), so that particular vulnerability isn't there anymore.
note that this means that some scripts that may have relied on earlier buggy behavior may no longer work correctly.
for clarity, you  may want to prefer reuseaddr.
perl 5.6.1 still works for amigaos (as does the 5.7.2 development release).
xml::parser not working use xml::parser 2.31 or later.
also, introduced @-and @+.
[561] file::spec->tmpdir() now prefers c:/temp over /tmp (works better when perl is running as service).
the documentation for the wince platform is called perlce (readme.ce in the source code kit), to avoid confusion with the perlwin32 documentation on 8.3-restricted filesystems.
perlapi.pod (a companion to perlguts) now attempts to document the internal  api.
note that  perlcc is still considered very experimental and unsupported.
in other words: you just have to recompile  your modules containing xs code, sorry about that.
clone will be executed once for every package that  has it defined or inherited.
these documents usually detail one or more of the following subjects: configuring, building, testing, installing, and sometimes also using perl on the said platform.
note,  however, that their prototype (as given by prototype("core::chomp") is undefined, because it cannot be  expressed and therefore one cannot really write replacements to override these  builtins.
unicode can be used in hash keys, unicode in regular expressions should work now, unicode in tr/// should work now, unicode in i/o should work now.
this is  caused by the characters \xff
the pat, tr, and fold failures are genuine perl problems caused by ebcdic (and in the pat and fold cases, combining that with unicode).
ndbm_file/ndbm.t 13 3328 71 59 83.10% 1-2 4 16-71 ../ext/
iterative logical name translations are now limited to 10 iterations in  imitation of show logical and other openvms facilities.
the suidperl functionality is likely to be removed in  a future release.
[561] readline() on files opened in "slurp" mode could  return an extra "" (blank line) at the end in certain situations.
data::dumper now has an option to sort hashes.
this feature helps in writing  internationalised software, and in general when the order of the parameters can  vary.
in other taint news, the exec list and system list have now been considered too risky (think exec @argv: it can start any program with any arguments), and now the said forms cause a warning under lexical warnings.
vos (stratus) when perl is built using the native build process on vos release 14.5.0 and  gnu c++/gnu tools 2.0.1, all attempted tests either pass or result in todo  (ignored) failures.
the  latter is an article about software localization, originally published in the  perl journal #13, and republished here with kind permission.
there is no need to escape any of the \w characters.
[561] earlier perls treated "sub foo (@bar)" as equivalent to "sub  foo (@)".

now xsubs can have attributes just like subs.
the core-dumping functionality will remain in future available as  an explicit call tocore::dump(), but in future releases the  behaviour of an unqualifieddump() call may change.
there may also be information at http://www.perl.com/ ,  the perl home page.
one potential failure is whether one can (or, if one can,  whether it's a good idea to) link together at all binaries with different ideas  about file offsets; all this is platform-dependent.
seethe perlvos manpage.
seethe perlaix manpage.
using the /g modifier in split() is meaningless and will cause  a warning.
the major reason for the discontinuity is the new io architecture called  perlio.
seelocalising tied arrays and hashes is broken.
this works again now.
highlights in 5.8.0 perl 5.8 is not binary compatible with earlier releases of perl.
perl will now first finish whatever it was doing,  like finishing an internal operation (like sort()) or an external operation  (like an i/o operation), and only then look at any arrived signals (and before  starting the next operation).
math::bigrat for big rational numbers, to accompany  math::bigint and math::bigfloat, from tels.
the suggested cure is to  upgrade your solaris.
in future releases this naming may change.
note that some of the net::ping tests are disabled when running under the perl distribution since one cannot assume one or more of the following: enabled echo port at localhost, full internet connectivity, or sympathetic firewalls.
beos has been reclaimed.
say chdir() if you really mean that.
appllib_exp, a lesser-known configuration-time definition, has been  documented.
\$bar[1] will assign undef to $bar[1] (assuming that it didn't exist before), but for tied/magical arrays and hashes such autovivification does not happen because there is currently no way to catch the reference creation.
... anonymous temporary files are available without need to 'use filehandle' or other module via open($fh,"+>", undef) ||
[561] numeric conversions did not recognize changes in the string value properly in certain circumstances.
note that the  new semantics doesn't work with the attribute::handlers module (as of version  0.76).
[561] win32::getcwd() correctly returns c:\ instead of c: when at the drive root.
[561] printing quads (64-bit integers) with printf/sprintf now works without the  q l ll prefixes (assuming you are on a quad-capable platform).
seethe perlunicode manpage, the utf8 manpage, and  http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr16/ for more information.
a failure (think chdir(some_function()) can lead into unintended chdir() to the home directory, therefore this behaviour is deprecated.
(5.7.0 came out before 5.6.1: the development branch 5.7 released earlier than the maintenance branch 5.6)
if that doesn't help, you may have to try removing all the .bundle files from beneath /library/perl, and again "make install"-ing.
policy.sh policy change: if you are reusing a policy.sh file (see install)  and you use configure -dprefix=/foo/bar and in the old policy $prefix eq  $siteprefix and $prefix eq $vendorprefix, all of them will now be changed to  the new prefix, /foo/bar.
be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.
[561] warnings::enabled() now reports the state of $^w correctly if the caller  isn't using lexical warnings.
seethe class::isa manpage.
[561] the following modules now work on windows: extutils::embed
the shell module now has an oo interface.
[561] numeric conversions did not recognize changes in the string value properly  in certain circumstances.
the my expr : attrs syntax now applies variable attributes at  run-time.
because in effect storable does serialisation of perl data structures, with it you can also clone deep, hierarchical datastructures.
[561] for perl developers, several new make targets for profiling and debugging have been added; seethe perlhack manpage.
lstat(filehandle) now gives a warning because the operation makes no sense.
quicksort has a worst case run time that can grow like  n**2, so-calledquadratic behaviour, and it can happen on patterns that  may well arise in normal use.
the current user-visible implementation of pseudo-hashes (the weird use of the first array element) is deprecated starting from perl 5.8.0 and will be removed in perl 5.10.0, and the feature will be implemented differently.
yes, much quicker than perlretut.
however, the lvalue subroutine feature still remains experimental.
as a part of the ithreads implementation perl will also use any necessary and detectable reentrant libc interfaces.
chdir() now works better despite a crt bug; now works with  multiplicity (see install); now works with perl's malloc.
the rules for allowing underscores (underbars) in numeric constants have  been relaxed and simplified: now you can have an underscore simply between digits.
storable was originally created by raphael manfredi, but it is now maintained  by abhijit menon-sen. storable has been enhanced to understand the two new hash  features, unicode keys and restricted hashes.
failure of thread (5.005-style) tests note that support for 5.005-style threading is deprecated,  experimental and practically unsupported.
the debugger can now show lexical variables if you have the cpan module padwalker installed.
alpha systems with old gccs fail several tests
use in production environments is discouraged.
this enables the new behaviour for perl embedders.
using splice() past the end of an array now causes a warning.
warnings relating to the use of the new restricted hashes feature have been added.
[561] html files will now be installed in c:\perl\html instead of c:\perl\lib\pod\html
tie::memoize, by ilya zakharevich, provides on-demand loaded  hashes.
the debugger can now show lexical variables if you have the cpan module  padwalker installed.
sometimes this problem may also indicate a partial perl 5.8.0 installation,  seemac os x dyld undefined symbols for an example and how to deal with it.
[561] zero entries were missing from the unicode classes such as isdigit .
(this problem didn't affect windows platforms.)
luckily, these days the need for h2ph is rare.
nonstop-ux is now supported.
for example, if you reallydon't care about the order of even and odd digits, quicksort will run in o(n) time; it's very good at sorting many repetitions of a small number of distinct elements.
malformed unicode encodings (utf-8 and utf-16) cause a lot of warnings, as does trying to use utf-16 surrogates (which are unimplemented).
more appropriate mechanisms for selecting the  implementation exist, but they wouldn't have arrived in time to save quicksort.
the output is  highly customisable.
switch, by damian conway, has been added.
several unicode fixes.
understanding of numbers in general a lot of fixing has happened in the area of perl's understanding  of numbers, both integer and floating point.
seethe locale::maketext manpage, and the locale::maketext::tpj13 manpage.
these will get installed as perljp perlko perlcn perltw
the exact numbers depend on the platform and perl  configuration used.
for example, \p{tibetan} refers to the script, while \p{intibetan} refers to the block.
hashes now use bob jenkins "one-at-a-time" hashing key algorithm ( http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/doobs.html ).
this is caused by darwin's ufs not supporting inode change time.
mkdir() now ignores trailing slashes in the directory name, as  mandated by posix.
quicksort was rescued by implementing a sort pragma to control aspects of  the sort.
thestable subpragma forces stable behaviour,  regardless of algorithm.
[561] autovivification of symbolic references of special variables described in the perlvar manpage (as in ${$num}) was accidentally disabled.
[561+] perlrequick is a regular expressions quick-start guide.
mac os x please remember to set your environment variable lc_all to "c"  (setenv lc_all c) before running "make test" to avoid a lot of  warnings about the broken locales of mac os x.
[561] the autouse pragma didn't work for multi::part::function::names.
the perl pack function now maps overflowed values to +infinity and underflowed values to -infinity.
in versions 5.004_01 through 5.6.0, the error was in string, @example now must be written as \@example the idea here was to get people into the habit of writing "fred\@example.com" when they wanted a literal @ sign, just as they have always written"give me back my \$5" when they wanted a literal $ sign.
the dynix/ptx platform (also known as dynixptx) is supported at or near  osvers 4.5.2.
nothing gets installed, but the code is worth studying  for extension writers.
xs::typemap, by tim jenness, is a test extension that exercises xs typemaps.
attributes::reftype() now works on tied arguments.
it broke at some point during the ithreads work and we could not find amiga experts to unbreak the problems.
[561] perlivp is a new installation verification procedure utility for running any time after installing perl.
on a really fast machine you can hope to finish the suite in about 6-8 minutes (wallclock time).
the following tests are known to fail in solaris x86 with perl configured to use 64 bit integers: ext/data/dumper/t/dumper.............failed at test 268 ext/devel/peek/peek..................failed at test 7
the debugger has a new dumpdepth option to control the maximum  depth to which nested structures are dumped.
most of the rest point at problems with sysv ipc.
you should carefully launder the arguments to guarantee their validity.
there is no need to \-escape  any\w character.
now perl postpones handling of signals until it's safe (between opcodes).
myvariables now handled at run-time use utf8, almost) glob()now returns filenames in alphabetical order perl58delta - what is new for perl v5.8.0 this document describes differences between the 5.6.0 release and the 5.8.0 release.
although "you shouldn't do that", it was possible to write code that depends on perl's hashed key order (data::dumper does this).
use locale::country; $country = code2country('jp'); # $country gets 'japan' $code = country2code('norway'); # $code gets 'no' see the locale::constants manpage, the locale::country manpage, the locale::currency manpage, and the locale::language manpage.
the following tests are known to fail in mac os x 10.1.5 because of buggy  (old) implementations of berkeley db included in mac os x: failed test stat wstat total fail failed list of failed  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  ../ext/db_file/t/db-btree.t 0 11 ?? ??
the same problem  affects slicing over non-existent indices/keys of a tied/magical array/hash.
country2code('norway'); # $code gets 'no' see the locale::constants manpage, the locale::country manpage, the  locale::currency manpage, and the locale::language manpage.
... that is a literal undef, not an undefined value.
note, however, that their prototype (as given by prototype("core::chomp") is undefined, because it cannot be expressed and therefore one cannot really write replacements to override these builtins.
many of these changes have been further developed since 5.6.1 was  released, those are marked[561+].
our() variables will not cause bogus "variable will not stay shared" warnings.
sort is a new pragma for controlling the behaviour of sort().
the dynix/ptx platform (also known as dynixptx) is supported at or near osvers 4.5.2.
open is a new pragma for setting the default i/o layers for open().
the performance has been improved for  common scenarios.
trying to use unicode characters on an i/o stream without marking the stream's encoding (using open() or binmode()) will cause "wide character" warnings.
also, $config{byteorder} is now computed dynamically--this is more robust  with "fat binaries" where an executable image contains binaries for  more than one binary platform, and when cross-compiling.
the leading _ is a reminder that these subpragmas may not survive beyond 5.8.
perl58delta - what is new for perl v5.8.0 description
tied hash interfaces are now required to have the exists and delete methods  (either own or inherited).
the test module has been significantly enhanced.
[561] posix::sleep() now returns the number of unslept seconds (as the posix standard says), as opposed to core::sleep() which returns the number of slept seconds.
again, this is not perl's fault-- the libc of mac os x is not threadsafe (in this particular test, the localtime() call is found to be threadunsafe.)
perl 5.8 unfortunately does not build anymore on amigaos; this broke accidentally at some point.
test::more, by michael schwern, is yet another framework for writing test scripts, more extensive than test::simple.
perl now tries internally to use integer values in numeric conversions and  basic arithmetics (+ - * /) if the arguments are integers, and tries also to  keep the results stored internally as integers.
{ s/ $from/$to/g; } }; 1; # in user's code: use myfilter qr/red/ => 'green'; print "red\n"; # this code is filtered, will print  "green\n" print "bored\n"; # this code is filtered, will  print "bogreen\n" no myfilter; print "red\n"; # this code is not filtered, will print  "red\n" file::temp, by tim jenness, allows one to create temporary  files and directories in an easy, portable, and secure way.
many of the bug fixes in 5.8.0 were already seen in the 5.6.1 maintenance  release since the two releases were kept closely coordinated (while 5.8.0 was  still called 5.7.something).
db-recno.t 149 3 2.01% 61
(\p{space} isn't, since that includes the vertical tabulator character, whereas \s doesn't.)
this was found to be an inconvenient interface, and in perl 5.8 the unicode  model has completely changed: now the "unicodeness" is bound to the  data itself, and for most of the time "use utf8" is not needed at  all.
a29k ^ cc-65 cc: error file =
hash  values output from the algorithm on a hash of all 3-char printable ascii keys  comes much closer to passing the diehard random number generation tests.
the  fatal error has been downgraded to an optional warning: possible unintended interpolation of @example in string this warns you that "fred@example.com" is going to  turn intofred.com if you don't backslash the @.
many of the new tests are of course introduced by the new  modules, but still in general perl is now more thoroughly tested.
there are now several profiling make targets.
the tr///c and tr///u features have been removed and will not return; the interface was a mistake.
the system function and backticks operator have improved functionality and better error handling.
[561+] scalar::util is a selection of general-utility scalar subroutines, such as blessed(), reftype(), and tainted().
in any case, suidperl should only be used by security experts who know exactly what they are doing and why they are using suidperl instead of some other solution such as sudo ( seehttp://www.courtesan.com/sudo/ ).
fork() emulation is now more robust, but still continues to  have a few esoteric bugs and caveats.
the prototypes are now checked better at compile-time for  invalid syntax.
we suggest upgrading to at  least vac version 5.0.1.0, that has been known to compile perl correctly.
(something thatour() does not and will not support.)
(subroutine and our variables still get attributes applied at compile-time.)
turning off "clrfness" is no longer enough to make a stream truly binary.
the most notable omission, for space considerations, is the unihan database.
next, by damian conway, is a pseudo-class for method redispatch.
several other encodings (like the rest of the iso-8859, cp*/win*, mac, koi8-r, three variants ebcdic, chinese, japanese, and korean encodings) are included and can be loaded at runtime.
[561] configure.gnu now works with options with whitespace in them.
[561+] a failed (pseudo)fork now returns undef and sets errno to eagain.
the thread extension is now not built at all under ithreads ( configure -duseithreads) because it wouldn't work anyway (the thread extension requires being configured with -duse5005threads).
as a stop-gap measure to avoid people from getting frustrated at the mysterious results (core dumps, most often), it is forbidden for now (you will get a fatal error even from an attempt).
use digest::md5 'md5_hex'; $digest = md5_hex("thirsty camel"); print $digest, "\n"; # 01d19d9d2045e005c3f1b80e8b164de1 note: the md5 backward compatibility module is deliberately  not included since its further use is discouraged.
extutils::makemaker has been significantly cleaned up and fixed.
perlutil explains the command line utilities packaged with the perl distribution.
you will now need an explicit untie to destroy a self-tied glob.
it  seems that for some reason "make install" doesn't always completely  overwrite the files in /library/perl.
perlbug is now much more robust.
the builtin dump() function has probably outlived most of its  usefulness.
if you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at http://bugs.perl.org/ .
test::more, by michael schwern, is yet another framework for  writing test scripts, more extensive than test::simple.
seethe  unicode::collate manpage.
see the perlmod manpage attribute::handlers, originally by damian conway and now maintained by arthur bergman, allows a class to define attribute handlers.
libnet, by graham barr, is a collection of perl5 modules related to network programming.
there is a make target called "perl.gprof" for  generating a gprofiled perl executable.
fork() emulation is now more robust, but still continues to have a few esoteric bugs and caveats.
seethe net::ftp manpage, the net::nntp manpage, the net::ping manpage (not part of libnet, but related), the net::pop3 manpage, the net::smtp manpage, and the net::time manpage.
perl_object has been completely removed.
[561+] perlebcdic contains considerations for running perl on ebcdic platforms.
modules may fail to compile at all, or they may compile and  work incorrectly.
internally, the execution of end blocks is now controlled by pl_exit_flags & perl_exit_destruct_end.
[561] configure support for pdp11-style memory models has been removed due to obsolescence.
file handles can translate character encodings from/to perl's internal  unicode form on read/write via the ":encoding()" layer.
use -ddebugging instead.
eval "v200" now works.
mime::quotedprint, by gisle aas, allows you to encode data in  quoted-printable encoding, as defined inrfc 2045 - mime (multipurpose  internet mail extensions).

this results hopefully in more accurate numbers.
but how about the odd numbers, which all compare equal?
seethe filter::util::call manpage.
using the /g modifier in split() is meaningless and will cause a warning.
this affects  builds with-duselongdouble.
this parallels the behavior of use vis-a-vis import.
perlutil explains the command line utilities packaged with the perl  distribution.
added a new posix-ish character class
the tr///c and tr///u features have been removed and will not return; the  interface was a mistake.

if you have gcc 3, there is a make target called "perl.gcov" for  creating a gcoved perl executable for coverage analysis.
perl 5.8 unfortunately does not build anymore on amigaos; this broke  accidentally at some point.
[561+] the new bignum, bigint, and bigrat pragmas, by tels, implement transparent bignum support (using the math::bigint, math::bigfloat, and math::bigrat backends).
[561] mac os classic is now supported in the mainstream source package (macperl has of course been available since perl 5.004 but now the source code bases of standard perl and macperl have been synchronised)
encode_base64('aladdin:open sesame'); $decoded = decode_base64 ($encoded); print $encoded, "\n"; # "qwxhzgrpbjpvcgvuihnlc2ftzq==" see the mime::base64 manpage.
if your file system supports symbolic links, you can build perl outside of  the source directory by mkdir perl/build/directory cd perl/build/directory sh  /path/to/perl/source/configure -dmksymlinks ...
on linux platforms the  /bin/mail program had an undocumented feature which when combined with suidperl  gave access to a root shell, resulting in a serious compromise instead of  reporting the exploit attempt.
(basically what happens is that competing  threads can corrupt shared global state, one good example being regular  expression engine's state.)
perlpodspec is a more formal specification of the pod format, mainly of interest for writers of pod applications, not to people writing in pod.
[561+], pod::parser, storable, term::ansicolor, test,  text-tabs+wrap.
map() could get pathologically slow when the result list it generates is larger than the source list.
if you run sort { $a  $b } ( 1 .. $n , 1 .. $n ); (something you might approximate if you wanted to merge two sorted arrays using sort), doubling $n doesn't just double the quicksort time, it quadruples it.
the even and odd numbers appear in the output in the same order they appeared in the input.
seethe attribute::handlers manpage.
the x command has been extended so that x n expr dumps out the value of expr to a depth of at mostn levels.
[561] configure no longer includes the dbm libraries (dbm, gdbm, db, ndbm) when  building the perl binary.
also, introduced @last_match_start and @last_match_end english aliases for @- and @+.
with these, you can implement rather advanced parsing algorithms.
file handles can be marked as accepting perl's internal encoding of unicode  (utf-8 or utf-ebcdic depending on platform) by a pseudo layer ":utf8"  : open($fh,">:utf8","uni.txt"); note for ebcdic users: the pseudo layer ":utf8" is erroneously  named for you since it's not utf-8 what you will be getting but instead  utf-ebcdic.
some versions of glibc have a broken modfl().
use of the /c match modifier without an accompanying /g modifier elicits a new warning: use of /c modifier is meaningless without /g.
for normal arrays $foo =
pod2html now produces xhtml 1.0.
any encoding supported by encode module is also available to the ":encoding()" layer if perlio is used.
seethe time::hires manpage.
no more corrupt internal state since the current operation is always finished first, but the signal may take more time to get heard.
memoize can make your functions faster by trading space for time, from mark-jason dominus.
the perl pack function now maps overflowed values  to +infinity and underflowed values to -infinity.
vac 5.0.0.0 may produce buggy code for perl the aix c compiler vac version 5.0.0.0 may produce buggy code, resulting in a few random tests failing when run as part of "make test", but when the failing tests are run by hand, they succeed.
seethe threads manpage and the threads::shared manpage, and the  perlthrtut manpage.
you can enable/disable them with use/no warnings 'file::find';.
b::concise, by stephen mccamant, is a new compiler backend for  walking the perl syntax tree, printing concise info about ops.
with split elicits use of /g modifier is meaningless in split.
printf() no longer resets the numeric locale to "c".
[561+] right-hand side magic (gmagic) could in many cases such as string  concatenation be invoked too many times.
end blocks are now run even if you exit/die in a begin block.
this feature helps in writing internationalised software, and in general when the order of the parameters can vary.
in clone you can do whatever you need to do, like for example handle the cloning of non-perl data, if necessary.
*foo{format} now works.
libnet, by graham barr, is a collection of perl5 modules related  to network programming.
[[.cc.]] and [[=c=]] are still  recognised but now cause fatal errors.
there are now about 69 000 individual tests (spread over  about 700 test scripts), in the regression suite (5.6.1 has about 11 700 tests,  in 258 test scripts)
previous versions of perl and some readings of some sections of camel iii implied that the :raw "discipline" was the inverse of :crlf.
you can ignore the error, but it does cause a slight problem: you cannot fully benefit from the h2ph utility (seeh2ph) that can be used to convert c headers to perl libraries, mainly used to be able to access from perl the constants defined using c preprocessor, cpp.
[561] sort() has been changed to use primarily mergesort internally  as opposed to the earlier quicksort.
the  template letters arej, j, f, and d .
for developers interested in enhancing perl's unicode capabilities: almost  all the ucd files are included with the perl distribution in thelib/unicore subdirectory.
if building threaded perl, you may get compilation warning from pp_sys.c: "pp_sys.c", line 4651.39: 1506-280 (w) function argument assignment between types "unsigned char*" and "const void*" is not allowed.
the most notable omission, for space considerations, is the  unihan database.
this will create in perl/build/directory a tree of symbolic links pointing to files in /path/to/perl/source.
since the new code is more correct (if you have two constants where the first one is a prefix of the second one, the first constantnever got defined), less lossy (it uses integers for integer constant, as opposed to the old code that used floating point numbers even for integer constants), and slightly faster, you might want to consider regenerating your extension code (the new scheme makes regenerating easy).h2xs now also supports c trigraphs.
failed at test 3 t/op/inccode.........................(crash) and a few lib/extutils tests, and several hundred encode/t/aliases.t failures that work fine with long filenames.
if your  existing programs depends on the underlying implementation, consider usingthe  class::pseudohash manpage from cpan.
this version of perl detects this brokenness and has a workaround for it.
there should be no reported test failures with a default configuration, though there are a number of tests marked todo that point to areas needing further debugging and/or porting work.
[561] the behaviour of non-decimal but numeric string constants such as  "0x23" was platform-dependent: in some platforms that was seen as 35,  in some as 0, in some as a floating point number (don't ask).
if tr/// is just counting characters, it doesn't attempt to modify its target.
unshift() should now be noticeably faster.
[561] duping socket handles with open(f, ">&mysock") now works under windows 9x.
this is now handled correctly.

the existing behaviour when localising tied arrays and hashes is wrong, and will be changed in a future release, so do not rely on the existing behaviour.
math::complex handles inf, nan etc., better.
in particular binmode(fh) - and hence:raw - will now turn off both  crlf and utf-8 translation and remove other layers (e.g. :encoding()) which  would modify byte stream.
they  are now magnitudes faster, and they support various bignum libraries such as  gmp and pari as their backends.
a number of other properties are now supported, including \p{l&} , \p{any} \p{assigned}, \p{unassigned} , \p{blank} [561] and \p{spaceperl} [561] (along with their \p{...} versions, of course).
perl 5.6.0 could emit spurious warnings about redefinition of dl_error() when statically building extensions into perl.
failing locale test 117 for iso 8859-15 locales the iso 8859-15 locales may fail the locale test 117 in freebsd.
generating illegal unicode code points such as u+fffe, or the utf-16  surrogates, now also generates an optional warning.
use of /c in substitutions, even with /g, elicits use of /c modifier is meaningless in s///. use of /g with split elicits use of /g  modifier is meaningless in split.
if this test fails, it indicates that your libc (c library) is not threadsafe.
linux with glibc 2.2.5 fails t/op/int subtest #6 with -duse64bitint
unadorned dump() will now give a warning suggesting to use explicit core::dump() if that's what really is meant.
in  particular, however, this allows variable attributes to be useful fortie interfaces, which was a deficiency of earlier releases.
our can now have an experimental optional attribute unique that affects how global variables are shared among multiple  interpreters, seeour in the perlfunc manpage.
this  has been corrected.
warnings relating to the use interpreter threads and their shared data have  been added.
[561] pack() / unpack() can now group template letters with ()and then apply repetition/count modifiers on the groups.
the perl5opt environment variable (for passing command line arguments to perl) didn't work for more than a single group of options.
unicode::normalize, by sadahiro tomoyuki, implements the various unicode normalization forms.
note that breaking out from potentially blocking operations should still  work, though.
in some setups the former has been known to  spuriously also try to run "make install".
the major reason for the discontinuity is the new io architecture called perlio.
carp now has better interface documentation, and the @carp_not interface  has been added to get optional control over where errors are reported  independently of @isa, by ben tilly.
use warnings qw(fatal all) did not work as intended.

if you intend to run only on fat (or if using anydbm_file on fat), run configure with the -ui_ndbm and -ui_dbm options to prevent ndbm_file and odbm_file being built.
[561] all the netbsd specific patches (except for the installation specific ones)  have been merged back to the main distribution.
this will default in 5.10.
what this means is that in list context the functions will return only three values, not four.
suidperl is neither built nor installed by  default.
interpreter threads (ithreads) is the new thread model introduced in  perl 5.6 but only available as an internal interface for extension writers (and  for win32 perl forfork() emulation).
[561] earlier perls treated "sub foo (@bar)" as equivalent to "sub foo (@)".
seethe b::concise manpage.
class::struct now assigns the array/hash element if the accessor is called  with an array/hash element as thesole argument.
do followed by a bareword now ensures that this bareword isn't  a keyword (to avoid a bug wheredo q(foo.pl) tried to call a  subroutine calledq).
the 5.005 threads model (module thread) is deprecated and expected to be removed in perl 5.10.

unicode can be used in hash keys, unicode in regular  expressions should work now, unicode in tr/// should work now, unicode in i/o  should work now.
compiling with gcc still  not recommended because buggy code results, even with gcc 2.95.2.
the builtin dump() function has probably outlived most of its usefulness.
[561] the semantics of bless(ref, ref) were unclear and until someone proves it to make some sense, it is forbidden.
this was caused by perl's using the operating system libraries in a situation where the result of the string to number conversion is undefined: now perl consistently handles such strings as zero in numeric contexts.
note that breaking out from potentially blocking operations should still work, though.
pdl failing some tests use pdl 2.3.4 or later.

in future  releases this naming may change.
net::ping has been considerably enhanced by rob brown: multihoming is now  supported, win32 functionality is better, there is now time measuring  functionality (optionally high-resolution using time::hires), and there is now  "external" protocol which uses net::ping::external module which runs  your external ping utility and parses the output.
test::simple, by michael schwern, has basic utilities for  writing tests.
guidelines of how to construct minimal perl installations have been added  to install.

[561] the makefiles now default to the features enabled in activestate activeperl (a popular win32 binary distribution).
an optional warning is generated ("illegal character in prototype...") but this may be upgraded to a fatal error in a future release.
but it is skipped for now  because the failure is apple's fault, not perl's (blocked signals are lost).
however,  the generated binaries continue to be incompatible with those generated by the  other supported compilers (gcc and visual c++).

pack() / unpack() can now process the perl internal numeric  types: ivs, uvs, nvs-- and also long doubles, if supported by the platform.
the bug has been fixed.
posix-style signals are now emulated much better on vms versions prior to 7.0.
appllib_exp, a lesser-known configuration-time definition, has been documented.
each unquoted argument will be automatically quoted to protect  whitespace, and any existing whitespace in the arguments will be preserved.

in order to be more consistent with  the return value ofref().
suggestions for new shiny examples welcome but the main issue is that the examples need to be documented, tested and (most importantly) maintained.
fcntl, socket, and sys::syslog have been rewritten by nicholas clark to use  the new-style constant dispatch section (seethe extutils::constant manpage).

pod2html now understands pod written using different line endings (pc-like crlf versus unix-like lf versus macclassic-like cr).
you can ignore the  error, but it does cause a slight problem: you cannot fully benefit from the  h2ph utility (seeh2ph) that can be used to convert c headers to perl  libraries, mainly used to be able to access from perl the constants defined  using c preprocessor, cpp.
modifying $_ inside for(..) for (1..5) { $_++ } works without complaint.
pack() / unpack() can now process the perl internal numeric types: ivs, uvs, nvs-- and also long doubles, if supported by the platform.

note that after this perl really does assume that everything is utf-8: for example if some input handle is not, perl will probably very soon complain about the input data like this "malformed utf-8 ..." since any old eight-bit data is not legal utf-8.
perliol documents the internals of perlio with layers.
[561] wait(), waitpid(), and backticks now return the correct exit status under windows 9x.
perlio is now the default.
for similar functionality, see  pack('u0', ...) and pack('c0', ...).
so the perlio:raw layer (or  "discipline", to use the camel book's older terminology) is now  formally defined as being equivalent to binmode(fh) - which is in turn defined  as doing whatever is necessary to pass each byte as-is without any translation.
mac os classic compilation of the standard perl distribution in mac os classic should now  work if you have the metrowerks development environment and the missing  mac-specific toolkit bits.
h2xs uses the new extutils::constant module which will affect newly created extensions that define constants.
[561] all the netbsd specific patches (except for the installation specific ones) have been merged back to the main distribution.
as a part of the ithreads implementation perl will also use any necessary  and detectable reentrant libc interfaces.
[561] selected bug fixes numerous memory leaks and uninitialized memory accesses have been hunted  down.
[561] wince is now supported.
two new debugging options have been added: if you have compiled your perl  with debugging, you can use the -dt
[561+] (5.6.1 has ucd 3.0.1.)
cygwin numerous updates; currently synchronised with cygwin 1.3.10.
compiling with gcc still not recommended because buggy code results, even with gcc 2.95.2.
in safe, %inc is now localised in a safe compartment so that use/require work.
if you don't have /bin/mail, or if you have 'safe setuid scripts', or if suidperl is not installed, you are safe.
for example: open kid_ps, "-|", "ps", "aux" or die $!; forks the ps(1) command (without spawning a shell, as there are more than three arguments to open()), and reads its standard output via the kid_ps filehandle.
[561] duping socket handles with open(f, ">&mysock") now works  under windows 9x.
ipc::open3 now allows the use of numeric file descriptors.
the suggested cure is to upgrade your solaris.
note that after this perl really does assume that everything is utf-8: for  example if some input handle is not, perl will probably very soon complain  about the input data like this "malformed utf-8 ..." since any old  eight-bit data is not legal utf-8.
the byteorder was only sizeof(long) bytes long (1234 or 4321), but now it is correctly sizeof(iv) bytes long, (12345678 or 87654321).
the glibc release 2.2.2 is known to  have fixed themodfl() bug.
the unimplemented posix regex features
libwww-perl (lwp) fails base/date #51 use libwww-perl 5.65 or later.
there are now about 69 000 individual tests (spread over about 700 test scripts), in the regression suite (5.6.1 has about 11 700 tests, in 258 test scripts)
the tr/// operator now works.
[561] extutils::makemaker now uses $env{lib} to search for libraries.
in any case, suidperl should only be used by security experts who know exactly  what they are doing and why they are using suidperl instead of some other  solution such as sudo ( seehttp://www.courtesan.com/sudo/ ).
the problem was caused by perl trying to report a suspected security  exploit attempt using an external program, /bin/mail.
io::socket::inet failed to open the specified port if the service name was  not known.
devel::ppport, originally by kenneth albanowski and now  maintained by paul marquess, has been added.
comparing with utf8 data does not magically upgrade non-utf8 data into  utf8.
in any case, the change will break existing code  that relies on the current (ill-defined) semantics, so just avoid doing this in  general.
/lib/math/bigint/t/sub_mbf.t 1633 4 0.24% 8 11 1632-1633 ..
(you should be able to modify only  lvalue elements inside the loops.)
seethe file::temp manpage.
hp-ux lib/posix subtest 9 fails when lp64-configured
(implemented by jeffrey friedl, nick ing-simmons, and michael schwern.)
in other taint news, the exec list and system list have now been considered too risky (thinkexec @argv: it can start  any program with any arguments), and now the said forms cause a warning under  lexical warnings.
iterative logical name translations are now limited to 10 iterations in imitation of show logical and other openvms facilities.
[561] some cases of inconsistent taint propagation (such as within hash values) have been fixed.
formats now support zero-padded decimal fields.
depending on your platform, there are also other reasons why we decided to  break binary compatibility, please read on.
file handles can be marked as accepting perl's internal encoding of unicode (utf-8 or utf-ebcdic depending on platform) by a pseudo layer ":utf8" : open($fh,">:utf8","uni.txt"); note for ebcdic users: the pseudo layer ":utf8" is erroneously named for you since it's not utf-8 what you will be getting but instead utf-ebcdic.
h2ph now supports c trigraphs.
the builtin dump() now gives an optional warning dump()  better written as core::dump(), meaning that by default dump(...) is resolved as the builtin dump() which dumps core and  aborts, not as (possibly) user-definedsub dump.
perl installation leaves libnet unconfigured; use libnetcfg to configure it.
[561] sort() is also fully reentrant, in the sense that the sort function can itself call sort().
[561+], pod::parser, storable, term::ansicolor, test, text-tabs+wrap.
perlpod has been rewritten to be clearer and to record the best practices gathered over the years.
text::balanced, by damian conway, has been added, for  extracting delimited text sequences from strings.
the suidperl functionality is most probably going to be removed in perl 5.10.
the justification for this rests with quicksort's worst case behavior.
unicos fixed various alignment problems that lead into core dumps either during build or later; no longer dies on math errors at runtime; now using full quad integers (64 bits), previously was using only 46 bit integers for speed.
it is now implemented  using a windows message loop, and is therefore less prone to random crashes.
[561] attributes (such as :shared) didn't work with our().
several debugger fixes: exit code now reflects the script exit code,  condition"0" now treated correctly, the d command now checks line number,$. no longer gets corrupted, and  all debugger output now goes correctly to the socket if remoteport is set.
math::bigfloat and math::bigint have undergone a full rewrite by tels.
do followed by a bareword now ensures that this bareword isn't a keyword (to avoid a bug where do q(foo.pl) tried to call a subroutine called q).
seethe perluniintro manpage for more  information about utf-8.
the socket extension is now dynamically loaded instead of being statically built in.
the main rationale was to have all core perlio  layers to have all lowercase names.
because of the unpredictability of tie-breaking order, and the quadratic  worst-case behaviour, quicksort wasalmost replaced completely with a  stable mergesort.
printf() and sprintf() now support parameter reordering using the %\d+\$ and *\d+\$ syntaxes.
cwd now has a split personality: if possible, an xs extension  is used, (this will hopefully be faster, more secure, and more robust) but if  not possible, the familiar perl implementation is used.
the default on vax (d_float) has not changed.
since the new code is more  correct (if you have two constants where the first one is a prefix of the  second one, the first constantnever got defined), less lossy  (it uses integers for integer constant, as opposed to the old code that used  floating point numbers even for integer constants), and slightly faster, you  might want to consider regenerating your extension code (the new scheme makes  regenerating easy).h2xs now also supports c trigraphs.
the core-dumping functionality will remain in future available as an explicit call to core::dump(), but in future releases the behaviour of an unqualified dump() call may change.
it can be used to prepend site-specific directories to perl's  default search path (@inc); see install for information.

but quicksort was rescued at the last moment  because it is faster than mergesort on certain inputs and platforms.
if you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at http://bugs.perl.org/ .
new unicode semantics (no more use utf8, almost) previously in perl 5.6 to use unicode one would say "use utf8"  and then the operations (like string concatenation) were unicode-aware in that  lexical scope.
(it is in fact a  full implementation of sed in perl: you can use the sed functionality by using  thepsed utility.)
for example printf "%2\$s %1\$s\n", "foo", "bar"; will print "bar foo\n".
os/2 test failures the following tests are known to fail on os/2 (for clarity only the  failures are shown, not the full error messages): ../lib/extutils/t/mkbootstrap.t 1 256 18 1 5.56% 8  ../lib/extutils/t/packlist.t 1 256 34 1 2.94% 17 ../lib/extutils/t/basic.t 1  256 17 1 5.88% 14 lib/os2_process.t 2 512 227 2 0.88% 174 209  lib/os2_process_kid.t 227 2 0.88% 174 209 lib/rx_cmprt.t 255 65280 18 3 16.67%  16-18 op/sprintf tests 91, 129, and 130 the op/sprintf tests 91, 129, and 130 are known to fail on some platforms.
[561+] scalar::util is a selection of general-utility scalar  subroutines, such asblessed(), reftype(), and tainted().
seethe memoize manpage.
and, ironically, this mergesort does particularly well where quicksort goes quadratic: mergesort sorts (1..$n, 1..$n) in o(n) time.
boms (byte order marks) at the beginning of perl files (scripts, modules)  should now be transparently skipped.
(this happens because the test scripts from under t/lib have been moved to be  closer to the library/extension they are testing.)
[561] mac os x (or darwin) should now be able to build perl even on hfs+  filesystems.
xsubpp now understands pod documentation embedded in the *.xs files.
the following tests are known to fail on os/2 (for clarity only the failures are shown, not the full error messages): ../lib/extutils/t/mkbootstrap.t 1 256 18 1 5.56% 8 ../lib/extutils/t/packlist.t 1 256 34 1 2.94% 17 ../lib/extutils/t/basic.t 1 256 17 1 5.88% 14 lib/os2_process.t 2 512 227 2 0.88% 174 209 lib/os2_process_kid.t 227 2 0.88% 174 209 lib/rx_cmprt.t 255 65280 18 3 16.67% 16-18 the op/sprintf tests 91, 129, and 130 are known to fail on some platforms.
the documentation for the posix-bc platform is called "bs2000", to avoid confusion with the perl posix module.
the comparison block is now run in scalar context, and the arguments to be sorted are always provided list context.
see the perldebguts manpage for more  complete information.
[[:blank:]] which stands for horizontal whitespace (currently, the space and the tab).
two new debugging options have been added: if you have compiled your perl with debugging, you can use the -dt
nothing gets installed, but the code is worth studying for extension writers.
it is now a top-level category  in its own right.
a version of  net::ping::external is available in cpan.
{ s/ $from/$to/g; } }; 1; # in user's code: use myfilter qr/red/ => 'green'; print "red\n"; # this code is filtered, will print "green\n" print "bored\n"; # this code is filtered, will print "bogreen\n" no myfilter; print "red\n"; # this code is not filtered, will print "red\n" file::temp, by tim jenness, allows one to create temporary files and directories in an easy, portable, and secure way.
seethe tie::memoize manpage.
carp was sometimes affected by this problem.
rather than relying on c's argv[0] (which may not contain a full pathname) where possible $^x is now set by asking the operating system.
the $config{byteorder} (and corresponding byteorder in config.h) was  previously wrong in platforms if sizeof(long) was 4, but sizeof(iv) was 8.
you won't notice this for small arrays, but you will notice it with larger arrays, and you may not live long enough for the sort to complete on arrays of a million elements.
seethe win32 manpage for  details.
perly.c, sv.c, and sv.h have now been  extensively commented.
[561] regular expression debug output (whether through use re 'debug' or via-dr) now looks better.
the socketpair tests are known to be unhappy in sco 3.2v5.0.4: ext/socket/socketpair.t...............failed tests 15-45
[561] printing quads (64-bit integers) with printf/sprintf now works without the q l ll prefixes (assuming you are on a quad-capable platform).
so sort { ($a % 2)  ($b % 2) } (3,1,4,1,5,9); will yield (4,3,1,1,5,9), guaranteed.
this file is supposed to be used by hints file writers for architecture-wide  changes (as opposed to config.over which is for site-wide changes).

if building perl with interpreter threads (ithreads), the getgrent() , getgrnam(), and getgrgid() functions cannot return the list of the group members due to a bug in the multithreaded support of unicos/mk.
'use lib' now works identically to @inc.
this is not selected by default, however, you must specify  -dusedl in the arguments of configure.
h2xs uses the new extutils::constant module which will affect  newly created extensions that define constants.
the thread extension is now not built at all under ithreads ( configure -duseithreads) because it wouldn't work anyway (the thread  extension requires being configured with-duse5005threads).
timing problems the following tests may fail intermittently because of timing problems, for  example if the system is heavily loaded.
the performance has been improved for common scenarios.
untie() will now call an untie() hook if it exists.
the regex compiler now maintains a structure that identifies nodes in the compiled bytecode with the corresponding syntactic features of the original regex expression.
this will create in perl/build/directory a tree of symbolic links pointing  to files in /path/to/perl/source.
[561] autovivification of symbolic references of special variables described in  the perlvar manpage (as in ${$num}) was accidentally disabled.
[561] the behaviour of non-decimal but numeric string constants such as "0x23" was platform-dependent: in some platforms that was seen as 35, in some as 0, in some as a floating point number (don't ask).
additional bonuses are that the worst case behaviour ofsort() is now better (in computer science terms it now runs in time o(n log n), as  opposed to quicksort's theta(n**2) worst-case run time behaviour), and that sort() is now stable (meaning that elements with identical keys  will stay ordered as they were before the sort).
stable means that ties are broken to preserve the  original order of appearance in the input array.
... or on already opened handles via extended binmode: binmode($fh,':encoding(iso-8859-7)'); the built-in layers are: unix (low level read/write), stdio (as in previous perls), perlio (re-implementation of stdio buffering in a portable manner), crlf (does crlf  "\n" translation as on win32, but available on any platform).
quicksort has a worst case run time that can grow like n**2, so-calledquadratic behaviour, and it can happen on patterns that may well arise in normal use.
but how about  the odd numbers, which all compare equal?
(this broke the tk  extension with 5.6.0.)
you can move the old perl shared library  out of the way like this: cd /library/perl/darwin/core mv libperl.dylib libperlold.dylib and then reissue "make install".
there are a few known test failures, see the perluts manpage (readme.uts).
this is not selected by default, however, you must specify -dusedl in the arguments of configure.
the template letters are j, j, f, and d .
seethe threads::shared manpage.
in multi-cpu boxes, there are some problems with the i/o buffering: some output may appear twice.
(bsd_glob() does still sort platform natively,  ascii or ebcdic, unless glob_alphasort is specified.)
socket extension dynamic in vms
similarly, building the digest::md5 extension has been known to fail with "*** termination code 139 (bu21)".
seethe  extutils::constant manpage.
[561] new or changed diagnostics please see the perldiag manpage for more details.
some extensions like mod_perl are known to have issues with `largefiles', a change brought by perl 5.6.0 in which file offsets default to 64 bits wide, where supported.
unicode::normalize, by sadahiro tomoyuki, implements the  various unicode normalization forms.
you will  now need an explicit untie to destroy a self-tied glob.
class::struct can now define the classes in compile time.
perlapi.pod (a companion to perlguts) now attempts to document the internal api.
in future releases of perl, non-perlio aware xs modules may become completely unsupported.
perlcc has been rewritten and its user interface (that is,  command line) is much more like that of the unix c compiler, cc.
if you are on irix or tru64 platforms, new profiling/debugging options have been added; seethe perlhack manpage for more information about pixie and third degree.
seethe perluniintro manpage for introduction and the perlunicode manpage for details.
see the digest::md5 manpage.
in aix 4.2, perl extensions that use c++ functions that use statics may have problems in that the statics are not getting initialized.
it also correctly changes directories when chasing symbolic links.
isalnum, isalpha, and isword now match titlecase.
seethe text::balanced manpage.
(pure perl modules should continue to work.)
restricted hashes a restricted hash is restricted to a certain set of keys, no keys outside  the set can be added.
tie::refhash::nestable, by edward avis, allows storing hash  references (unlike the standard tie::refhash)
instead, if you explicitly choose not to use perlio (configure command line option -uuseperlio), you will get "-stdio" appended.
the debugger has a new dumpdepth option to control the maximum depth to which nested structures are dumped.
sometimes this problem may also indicate a partial perl 5.8.0 installation, seemac os x dyld undefined symbols for an example and how to deal with it.
since there are not that many amiga developers  available, we could not get this fixed and tested in time for 5.8.0.
policy.sh policy change: if you are reusing a policy.sh file (see install) and you use configure -dprefix=/foo/bar and in the old policy $prefix eq $siteprefix and $prefix eq $vendorprefix, all of them will now be changed to the new prefix, /foo/bar.
chdir("") and chdir(undef) now give a deprecation warning because they cause a possible unintentional chdir to the home directory.
i18n::langtags, by sean burke, has functions for dealing with rfc3066-style language tags.
a change to self-tying of globs has caused them to be recursively referenced (see:two-phased garbage collection in the perlobj manpage).
if configure finds that gcc was built for a different operating  system release than is running, it now gives a clearly visible warning that  there may be trouble ahead.
cygwin "unable to remap" for example when building the tk extension for cygwin, you may get an error  message saying "unable to remap".
digest, frontend module for calculating digests (checksums),  from gisle aas, has been added.
in many platforms, the vendor-supplied 'cc' is too stripped-down to build  perl (basically, 'cc' doesn't do ansi c).
see the perlnetware manpage.
aix should now work better with gcc, threads, and 64-bitness.
the problem has been corrected.
stratus vos is now supported using perl's native build method (configure).
this will be changed in a future release, but we don't know yet what the new semantics will exactly be.
use text::balanced 'extract_delimited'; ($a, $b) =
[561] file::spec->tmpdir() now prefers c:/temp over /tmp (works  better when perl is running as service).
in the ithreads model any data sharing between  threads must be explicit, as opposed to the model where data sharing was  implicit.
the older methods, which build miniperl, are still available.
hash values output from the algorithm on a hash of all 3-char printable ascii keys comes much closer to passing the diehard random number generation tests.
use of the /c match modifier without an accompanying /g modifier elicits a new warning: use of /c modifier is meaningless  without /g.
case 1 { print "number 1" } case "a" { print "string a" } case [1..10,42] { print "number in list" } case (@array) { print "number in list" } case /\w+/ { print "pattern" } case qr/\w+/ { print "pattern" } case (%hash) { print "entry in hash" } case (\%hash) { print "entry in hash" } case (\&sub) { print "arg to subroutine" } else { print "previous case not true" } }
os/2 now works with usethreads (see install).
the english module can now be used without the infamous performance hit by  saying use english '-no_match_vars'; (assuming, of course, that you don't need the troublesome variables $` , $&, or $'.)
the warnings are being worked on.
it converts pod data to formatted overstrike text.
clone will be executed once for every package that has it defined or inherited.
the  rationale is that neither doeslocaltime(), and timelocal() and localtime() are supposed to be inverses of each other.
all thread tests of perl now work,  but not without adding some yield()s to the tests, so while pth (and other  userlevel thread implementations) can be considered to be "working"  with perl ithreads, keep in mind the possible non-preemptability of the  underlying thread implementation.
a reference to a reference now stringifies as "ref(0x81485ec)" instead of "scalar(0x81485ec)" in order to be more consistent with the return value of ref().
in future releases, non-perlio aware xs modules may become completely  unsupported.
storable was originally created by raphael manfredi, but it is now maintained by abhijit menon-sen. storable has been enhanced to understand the two new hash features, unicode keys and restricted hashes.
see http://www.cpan.org/src/5.0/sperl-2000-08-05/sperl-2000-08-05.txt for more information.
you will need a thread library package installed.
beware: microperl makes many assumptions, some of which may be too bold; the resulting executable may crash or otherwise misbehave in wondrous ways.
if, by ilya zakharevich, is a new pragma for conditional  inclusion of modules.
test 91 is known to fail on qnx6 (nto), because sprintf '%e',0 incorrectly produces0.000000e+0 instead of 0.000000e+00 .
rather than relying on c's argv[0] (which may not contain a full pathname)  where possible $^x is now set by asking the operating system.
modulus of unsigned numbers now works (4063328477 % 65535 used to return 27406, instead of 27047).
note that the tr///cu functionality has been removed (but see pack('u0', ...)).
mime::quotedprint, by gisle aas, allows you to encode data in quoted-printable encoding, as defined inrfc 2045 - mime (multipurpose internet mail extensions).
perltootc has been renamed as perltooc (to not to conflict with perltoot in filesystems restricted to "8.3" names).
installation and configuration improvements generic improvements install now explains how you can configure perl to use 64-bit integers even  on non-64-bit platforms.
concatenation with the . operator or via variable  interpolation,eq, substr, reverse, quotemeta, the x operator, substitution with s/// , single-quoted utf-8, should now work.
the method is also exportable  as asockatmark() function.
the builtin dump() now gives an optional warning dump() better written as core::dump(), meaning that by default dump(...) is resolved as the builtin dump() which dumps core and aborts, not as (possibly) user-defined sub dump.
to call the  latter, qualify the call as&dump(...).
comparing with utf8 data does not magically upgrade non-utf8 data into utf8.
the lexical warnings category "deprecated" is no longer a sub-category of the "syntax" category.
you can see the correct behaviour by replacing the 1..5 with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
this may or may not be a problem with ancient tcp/ip stacks of vms:  we do not know since we weren't able to test perl in such configurations.
note that this means that some scripts that may have relied on earlier  buggy behavior may no longer work correctly.
in particular binmode(fh) - and hence :raw - will now turn off both crlf and utf-8 translation and remove other layers (e.g. :encoding()) which would modify byte stream.
see the sort pragma for information.
it points at some problems  with the signedness handling of the c compiler, as do the 64bitint, arith, and  pow failures.
if that  doesn't help, you may have to try removing all the .bundle files from beneath  /library/perl, and again "make install"-ing.
this improves the portability ofsystem(@args) by avoiding the need  for windowscmd shell specific quoting in perl programs.
modulus of unsigned numbers now works (4063328477 % 65535 used to return  27406, instead of 27047).
allow a read-only string on the left-hand side of a non-modifying tr///. if stderr is tied, warnings caused by warn and die now correctly pass to it.
(previously perl always preferred floating point numbers in its math.)
the tainting of %env elements via keys or values was previously unimplemented.
callbacks (naughtily) exiting with "next;" instead of "return;" now work.
the aix dynaloading now uses in aix releases 4.3 and newer the native dlopen interface of aix instead of the old emulated interface.
as of november 2001 the only known vulnerable platform is linux, most  likely all linux distributions.
any encoding supported by encode module is also available to the  ":encoding()" layer if perlio is used.
see  the i18n::langinfo manpage.
eastern asian perl users are now welcomed in their own languages: readme.jp (japanese), readme.ko (korean), readme.cn (simplified chinese) and readme.tw (traditional chinese), which are written in normal pod but encoded in euc-jp, euc-kr, euc-cn and big5.
if one attempts the test on a fat install (or build) the following failures are expected: ../ext/
emacs perl mode (emacs/cperl-mode.el) has been updated to version 4.31.
though mostly working, unicode support still has problem spots on ebcdic platforms.
file handles can be opened to "in memory" files held in perl  scalars via: open($fh,'>', \$variable) ||
the version of berkeley db used when the perl (and, presumably, the db_file extension) was built is now available as @config{qw(db_version_major db_version_minor db_version_patch)} from perl and as db_version_major_cfg db_version_minor_cfg db_version_patch_cfg from c. building berkeley db3 for compatibility modes for db, ndbm, and odbm has been documented in install.
[561] file::glob now supports glob_limit constant to limit the size  of the returned list of filenames.

the fatal error has been downgraded to an optional warning: possible unintended interpolation of @example in string this warns you that "fred@example.com" is going to turn into fred.com if you don't backslash the @. see http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/at-error.html for more details about the history here.
pod::text::overstrike, by joe smith, has been added.
this algorithm is reasonably fast while producing a much better spread of values than the old hashing algorithm (originally by chris torek, later tweaked by ilya zakharevich).
mod_perl 1.26 doesn't build with threaded perl use mod_perl 1.27 or higher.
thex command has been  extended so thatx n expr dumps out the value of expr to a  depth of at mostn levels.
scalar() now forces scalar context even when used in void  context.
note that the new semantics doesn't work with the attribute::handlers module (as of version 0.76).
multithreaded code should be migrated to the new ithreads model (seethe threads manpage, the threads::shared manpage and the perlthrtut manpage).
it also has been made more portable.
[[:space:]] to include the (very rarely used) vertical tab character.
perl 5.8.0 doesn't build in amigaos.
currently onlyprintf() is tested: how to output  various basic data types from xs.
when there is no name conflict, you can omit thein from the block name (e.g. \p{braillepatterns}), but to be  safe, it's probably best to always use thein).
see install for more details.
# in myfilter.pm: use filter::simple sub { while (my ($from, $to) =
note that perlcc is still considered very experimental and unsupported.
perlclib documents the internal replacements for standard c library functions.
seethe pod::text::overstrike manpage.
this improvement is only available on vms v6.0 and later.
[561] deprecations the semantics of bless(ref, ref) were unclear and until someone proves it  to make some sense, it is forbidden.
you should migrate your code to ithreads.
but it is skipped for now because the failure is apple's fault, not perl's (blocked signals are lost).
class::isa, by sean burke, is a module for reporting the search path for a class's isa tree.
file::find now chdir()s correctly when chasing symbolic links.
trying to use unicode characters on an i/o stream without marking the  stream's encoding (usingopen() or binmode()) will cause "wide  character" warnings.
although "you shouldn't do that", it was possible to write code  that depends on perl's hashed key order (data::dumper does this).
the perl header files no longer suppress common warnings from the microsoft visual c++ compiler.
the only exception is that a in prefix is required to signify a unicode block when a block name conflicts with a script name.
(nice for pre-5.8.0 backward compatibility).
package mypack; use attribute::handlers; sub wolf :attr(scalar) { print  "howl!\n" } # later, in some package using or inheriting from mypack... my mypack $fluffy : wolf; # the attribute handler wolf will be called both variables and routines can have attribute handlers.
seethe attributes manpage for additional details.
alternatively, you may want to use gnu make.
devel::peek now has an interface for the perl memory statistics (this works  only if you are using perl's malloc, and if you have compiled with debugging).
changed internals perlio is now the default.
tie::file, by mark-jason dominus, associates a perl array with  the lines of a file.
check your shared library path, and any shared perl libraries in those directories.
the latter is an article about software localization, originally published in the perl journal #13, and republished here with kind permission.
you can set the environment variable perl_test_net_ping to "1" (one)  before running the perl test suite to enable all the net::ping tests.
seethe perlio::via manpage and the perlio::via::quotedprint manpage.
after  configure has finished, you can just say make all test and perl will be built and tested, all in perl/build/directory.
file handles can translate character encodings from/to perl's internal unicode form on read/write via the ":encoding()" layer.
in particular, however, this allows variable attributes to be useful for tie interfaces, which was a deficiency of earlier releases.

note that the 5.005 threads are unsupported and deprecated: if you  have code written for the old threads you should migrate it to the new ithreads  model.
in safe, %inc is now localised in a safe compartment so that  use/require work.
in future releases this may become a fatal error.
posix-style signals are now emulated much better on vms versions prior to  7.0.

the information is attached to the newoffsets member of thestruct regexp.
changes that were integrated into the 5.6.1 release are marked [561] .
[561] pack "z" now correctly terminates the string with "\0".
the lexical warnings category "deprecated" is no longer a  sub-category of the "syntax" category.
cert and various vendors and distributors have  been alerted about the vulnerability.
(well, at least the built-in attributes.)
this is known problem with cygwin,  and a workaround is detailed in here: http://sources.redhat.com/ml/cygwin/2001-12/msg00894.html cygwin ndbm tests fail on fat one can build but not install (or test the build of) the ndbm_file on fat  filesystems.
[561] less stack reserved per thread so that more threads can run concurrently.
see the perldebguts manpage for more complete information.
you can regard this as totally trivial, or somewhat  profound.
ieee-format floating point default on openvms alpha perl now uses ieee format (t_float) as the default internal floating point  format on openvms alpha, potentially breaking binary compatibility with  external libraries or existing data.
seethe perlio::via manpage and the perlio::via::quotedprint  manpage.
the problem was caused by perl trying to report a suspected security exploit attempt using an external program, /bin/mail.
a new command-line option, -t is available.
filter::simple, by damian conway, is an easy-to-use frontend to filter::util::call.
please remember to set your environment variable lc_all to "c" (setenv lc_all c) before running "make test" to avoid a lot of warnings about the broken locales of mac os x.
(they  produce something other than "1" and "-1" when formatting  0.6 and -0.6 using the printf format "%.0f"; most often, they produce  "0" and "-0".)
perlio::via::quotedprint, by elizabeth mattijsen, is an  example of aperlio::via class: use perlio::via::quotedprint; open($fh,">:via(quotedprint)", $path); this will automatically convert everything output to $fh to  quoted-printable.
with the quicksort algorithm used to implement perl 5.6 and earlier, the order of ties is left up to the sort.
autoload is now lvaluable, meaning that you can add the :lvalue attribute to autoload subroutines and you can assign to the autoload return value.
the new algorithm "one-at-a-time" produces a different hashed key order.
installation (or build) on ntfs works fine.
seethe math::bigrat manpage.
io::socket::inet now supports a value of zero for localport (usually meaning that the operating system will make one up.)
in some setups the former has been known to spuriously also try to run "make install".
the character tables have been updated to unicode 3.2.0.
using sort in scalar context now issues an optional warning.
this is a known bug in the glibc 2.2.5 with long long integers.
the vars pragma now supports declaring fully qualified variables.
decode_qp( $encoded); print $encoded, "\n"; # "=de=ad=be=ef\n" print  $decoded, "\n"; # "\xde\xad\xbe\xef\n" see also the perlio::via::quotedprint manpage.
db_file now supports newer berkeley db versions, among other improvements.
[561+] a lost warning "can't declare ... dereference in my" has been  restored (perl had it earlier but it became lost in later releases.)
large unsigned numbers (those above 2**31) could sometimes lose their  unsignedness, causing bogus results in arithmetic operations.
the perlio::scalar and perlio::via (capitalised) were renamed as perlio::scalar and perlio::via (all lowercase) just before 5.8.0.
one reason of this unfinishedness is its (currently) inherent  unportability: since both package names and subroutine names may need to be  mapped to file and directory names, the unicode capability of the filesystem  becomes important-- and there unfortunately aren't portable answers.
mime::base64, by gisle aas, allows you to encode data in base64, as defined inrfc 2045 - mime (multipurpose internet mail extensions) .

however, if you just want to sort the even digits ahead of the odd ones, then what will sort { ($a % 2)  ($b % 2) } @digits; yield?
all regular expression compilation error messages are now hopefully easier  to understand both because the error message now comes before the failed regex  and because the point of failure is now clearly marked by a{bar} has  been deprecated for a while.
this seems to be a compiler  error since if compiled with gcc no core dump ensues, and no failures have been  seen on the said test on any other platform.
so the perlio :raw layer (or "discipline", to use the camel book's older terminology) is now formally defined as being equivalent to binmode(fh) - which is in turn defined as doing whatever is necessary to pass each byte as-is without any translation.
[561] multi-line matches like "a\nxb\n" =~ /(?!\a)x/m were flawed.
internally,  the execution of end blocks is now controlled by pl_exit_flags &  perl_exit_destruct_end.
because of the large number of tests, running the regression suite will take considerably longer time than it used to: expect the suite to take up to 4-5 times longer to run than in perl 5.6.
unicode::collate, by sadahiro tomoyuki, implements the uca (unicode collation algorithm) for sorting unicode strings.
handlers can be specific to type (scalar, array, hash, or code), or specific to the exact compilation phase (begin, check, init, or end).
tru64 (aka digital unix,
there may also be information at http://www.perl.com/ , the perl home page.
many test suite tests still fail and the co-existence of unicode  and ebcdic isn't quite settled, but the situation is much better than with perl  5.6.
the exact numbers depend on the platform and perl configuration used.
enc2xs is a tool for people adding their own encodings to the  encode module.
[561] io::pipe io::poll net::ping io::file::new_tmpfile() is no longer limited to 32767 invocations  per-process.
the  behavior in earlier versions of perl 5 was that arrays would interpolate into  strings if the array had been mentioned before the string was compiled, and  otherwise perl would raise a fatal compile-time error.
class::struct now assigns the array/hash element if the accessor is called with an array/hash element as thesole argument.
there is no need to \-escape any \w character.
