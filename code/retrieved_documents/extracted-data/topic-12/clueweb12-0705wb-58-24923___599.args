with roadster 450kg battery pack, assuming 100kg casing, that would be 350kg*200wh/kg =
but it could improve the range while listening to music or running the ac.brandon smith 10:54am | apr 7, 2009
i have sometimes thought about very large folded thin-film solar cell in car trunk that you could unfold as a kind of tent for that car when you park your car for a longer times in places where there are no electric plugs where you could charge your car.
batteries also lose capacity over time, so that is another loss for that model.
whether this represents human transportation efficiency (if you consider driving time unproductive) or not, the fact is that drivers actually spend most of their driving miles at low speeds.
not entirely impossible if something like focus fusion concept can be miniaturized in car-size energy source.
the companies named are good car builders, but they are not specialists in electrochemistry.
all these numbers are significantly lower than 80% efficiensy vaguely claimed for tesla roadster in the early days of development.
the experience that i am having with my roadster agrees with all of your data, except the wh/mi at 60 mph.
50kwh needs with (un)usual 100a fuse 500v in order to charge it in a hour.
those mit genshock shocks generate very little energy.
so actually a 350 mile range would be sufficient, if the facilities were available for fully recharging the car in 15 miinutes or so.
the batteries are almost entirely recyclable, and the power they store is generated far more cleanly and efficiently than gasoline can achieve.
if i drive around 56.2 and 44 mph at those faster sections of those roads and don't pass any cars and generally use regen at every opportunity at slower parts of the road trip i might actually manage to get to my destination with just 300 mile epa range.
2000 miles at 60 mph would mean 33 hours of driving without chance to charge even slowly.
basically a better battery.
as a full atom hydrogen and helium are nearly same size, because most of the size comes from electrons that surround that atom.
1080m^2 surface area compared to about 30m^2 surface area in those car roofs.
based on the same set of standards different ev could be made.
apparently this "discovery" is being announced next week at a japanese energy conference, and this is sponsored in part by the japanese government (the japanese corporate culture is a bit weird compared to america/europe on this point, and i think the sponsorship issue is lost in translation).
so storing and draining spin could create an energy-dense battery setup, or sensitive detection devices.
with the roof on it gets even worse.
30kw connection to charge it back full during night.
with a plugin hybrid you can always stop at a gas station.
also required amps and volts are huge.
that is the hard part.... where alternative storage devices would certainly be capable of being swapped in for what tesla is already using.
a non-ess warranty extension is available for usd$5,000 and adds another 3/36 to the coverage of components, excluding the ess, for a total of 6 years/72,000 mi (120,000 km).[brian h 9:03pm | sep 12, 2009
type s faq talks about fast charging and says that car can be charged to 80% as little time as 45 min.
you've underestimated the amount of drag it would produce and you've overestimated the amount of electricity a tiny wind turbine can produce.
three times nitrodragster power using better wh batteries than roadster current.
there was nothing wrong with the trajectory or speed of takeoff, but the control module thought so, and triggered the self-destruct.
when you go up hill, you would use the normal battery power to move the car.
450w out of 15000w is 3% and that would be less in practice.
coal is very very dirty and clean burning coal is a long ways off.
having stores in distant country will be then a great point.
else we will all be green because we'll be in the dark with no electricity.
in an ice car, it takes energy from the motor and turns it into electricity.
i would like to see tesla go on further developing thir engine and maybe more models.
considering that 185kw electric engine weights a lot less than 185kw ice engine + heavier transmission + other accessories that ice needs weight/power -ratio is then in bev favor.
(because the solar panel will generate electricity, while moving or standing still) prove me wrong.
it's rather unfortunate that the trips where the driving range is most important are the very ones where the driving speeds are going to be the highest.
this might cost a bit to produce, but all the components are here already: contract with daimler and tesla expertise of ev.
helium doesn't from molecules, it is noble gas and chemically inert, it also contains two neutrons in addition to two protons.
no capacitor can match that.
it would be also cost per kwh of extra energy you got by such swap.
even more ways to reduce power consumption will be developed of which i am sure but thats the way i think.
in this blog jb straubel has charts that show that roadster real mileage efficiency is more like 220-250 wh/mile which is 137-156 wh/km (between 50-60mph).
4wd is safer only to unskilled driver that has no experience of driving in slippery roads (just because you lose grip later with 4wd).
they have a small battery to aid acceleration and capture re-gen from braking, and drive electric motors.
if you took a short straight freeway to the top of a hill where you work, and then took the lazy windy downhill road home, that took you 1/2 hour longer, you may never have to charge your car, or at least less often.
the way the charge stations would be profitable would be from as you said a restaurant , food mart, arcade, or some other store front, or mechanics shop.
10:51pm | dec 20, 2008 engineering question: so...the idea is to use the car to run 20 minute sprints on a road course; given that you need to modify the suspension, add racing tires, etc.
so now, not only do i need the cruise control to work down to 25mph for city streets, i need it to go down to 17mph so i can drive 400 miles.
i think most places would allow you to install a charging station probably without any monthly fee, just for the good pr and ability to advertise they have one, the bigger problem would be with potential vandalism; they will have to be locked up during non-business hours.
the range extender is dead weigh just like the extra battery capacity is dead weigh when not used for the average commute distance.
nuclear energy would provide the cleanest form of almost unlimited electrical energy allowing us to charge our vehicles.
if all this technologies, if affordable, are installed in the same car it can give huge result.
for me i want to see an electric car that can do 600km in the depths of winter and the hieghts of summer.
now it is not even a news to have 500wh/kg energy density, in fact all tests are made for those chemistries that provide *at least* that high energy density.
the electric drive ist not taken serious in europe, yet.
if individual battery unit lasts 410 cycles with over 80% of capacity you have your 100 000 mile lifetime.
engineers don't believe that "overunity devices" work, and the only way you'll ever get them to listen is to build a fully functional model that they can test.
the other problem with battery to battery is that order to completely fill an empty battery you need the charger battery to be twice the capacitance of the empty.
i think e-wolf will do well.
there just needs to be more charging infrastructure before we get to that point as timo suggested or increased range to avoid recharging away from home.
the car travels well in the snow.. like "ho hum" i thought there was going to be bad weather.
firmly attached to the center-sill, would be each wheel-motor.
this generator or numerous ones could power accessories saving precious battery power.
if someone here understands what is being said in there in plain english (meaning potential wh/kg or w/kg or something like that) i would very much like to have translation for dummies.
the car will regenerate its own power.
there will never be enough "type s" -cars in close proximity of swapping station to make that profitable.
you need to use power in order to generate hydrogen and that process has poor efficiency currently.
can you test that (in here there is every now and then automatic radar next to highway that shows you how fast you are going.
force/torque/power/work/energy etc.
when truckers change to bev ice is gone for good.david r. 4:08pm | mrt 24, 2009 have any customers told you their observed range in real life driving.
because this car is really impressive!
magnetic sounds good, because there is no physical contact between gears.
as an engineer with a transmission (ivt) invention, i've studied vehicle kinetics and demographic statistics to get a feel for real-world practical applications of transmissions; this study revealed that american drivers go only 11 m.p.h.
if you look at jb's table above the tesla uses around 280wh/mile or so at 65mph (110km\h) the tesla with a 55kwh battery would theoretically go (55000/280) =
car has been tested in sweden for cold climate and how well it behaves in slippery roads.
all electric is the way to go.
my only concern is the magnetic fields produced by the motor, and the possible adverse effects on the occupants.
torque remains linear up to the point where the voltage becomes a limitation, and then falls off.
i have been met with self- righteous, more holy than thow responces.
and we would show the world that american ingenuity is alive and well and always will be.
then it is just matter of marketing so that general public gets aware of those cars.
jay rosenberg dear tesla motors: we are commercializing our ret, high efficiency, low cost, green, light weight, multi-fuel thermomechanical engine or powerblock.
without this the top speed would actually be slower because the wind and rolling resistance would overcome the available power before the peak power was achieved.
natural gas is getting very popular in eu lately.
so if you can produce, let say 20kw with generator and charge battery with that leftover 5kw you should be able to use battery for accelerations and still get battery slowly charged.
this is so if one fails, then it has minimal impact on overall performance.
this method would solve many of the range problems of ev's and could start as a slow moving infrastructure expanding from each tesla dealer much like the marriage of the big three and big oil.
i also like the idea of a hood scope or grill scope which would turn a wind generator under the hood.
that means that larger losses are result of bigger weight (mass, inertia, whatever) , and in steady highway speed only rolling resistance which is bigger in bigger car causes type s to lose to roadster in wh/mile comparison.
run as fast as you can...andrew parker 7:36pm | mrt 22, 2009 thanks so much for the link to the data.
that way, when driving on the interstate, the battery could be extended for greater distance as it is constantly being recharged, especially at higher speeds.
we have here in finland about half a year snow and ice (depends of where you go here, in lapland snow begins much earlier and lasts much longer than in south-coastal areas).
fuel cell cars and hybrids are much more complicated than bevs and for tesla who does not already have vested manufacturing in ices or fcs, it would be a major effort.
cm 3:04pm | dec 28, 2009 cablechewer: the only way battery swapping makes economic sense is if the batteries are leased from the swap company.
i do not understand how you can claim to get 244 miles per charge with the roadster when gm's volt and others are claiming 40 miles per charge with the same lithium ion battery technology.
increased battery to 85kwh and rolling resistance from around 55 to 85wh/mil to get 300 miles at 60mph.
just like solar photovoltaic cells, battery tech improves fast, really fast, and while doing so prices go down / kwh battery pack can hold.
this is a little like regenerative breaking, where you generate electricity when you put on the break and slow down, but different in that you use the inertia of the downward pull of the car as your car travels down hill for 1/2 an hour to an hour, to charge your battery pack, thus use the generated power going down hill, without use of breaking, to charge.
i wonder if they have regenerative braking also from brake-pedal in type s, and ordinary friction brakes are used only with very high deacceleration needs (kind of emergency brakes).joe simone 7:53am | mei 5, 2009 response to: ronald wose wrote on may 3rd, 2009 at 5:09 pm first of all taking a straight freeway to work and then taking a downhill run to go back home is not possible.
this is very relevant to range but does not consider the losses associated with the onboard battery charger or some of the slight round-trip energy losses in the battery itself.
there are also low light solar panels on the way.
even "solar powered" cars need sunlight as an energy source.
seems like the oil companies still have the upper hand and have enough control over gm to keep them firmly focused on selling gas guzzelers.
so 20 minutes would be 25 miles.
it also means max recharge speed is calculated in seconds.
it is the astm (all speed transmission motor).
that's a 21% increase in efficiency and range, and would get you about 250 miles at a steady 60mph.
(hard fast driving would use more, gentle driving less)
for the modeling above, we assumed that there was not heating or air conditioning load, but if there were it would show up here.
when type s is ready it should have 600 mile range, not 300.
an important factor is that the roadster is a very small car and as the frontal area is significantly smaller, then it requires less energy to drive down the highway.
just a thought terry pokornyliam mullen 3:56pm | mrt 20, 2009 thank you very much roy for all of that information.
that link atv has usual lead-acid batteries (6 x 12v-50ah sla agm).
pulse width modulation electrical power controllers give us new options to operate motor generators.
i did not say too much in my letter because if it is useful then i think the tesla would be the ideal development because of its power.
sorry to say, i suspect the ford and chrysler engineers may be right and you've overlooked someting that prevents your idea from working.
the ice would then turn on at a pre-determined battery level and top-you-up as you drive giving almost a whole day of highway cruising.
that would weight about 200kg.
while the roadster is not practical for a family, i am excited about the new s model that is coming out.
in case if you take average for fossil fuels you get aboput twice less pollution from electric car because of twice less fossil fuel energy use coming to wheels for same driving.
a similar proposal would use overhead "tow-motors" to literally pull vehicles along the road, usable to any "towable" vehicle.
right now our automobile fleet is a major consumer of petroleum in the form of gasoline and diesel fuel.
aerodynamics and tire draws wont be effected significantly.
first: electric cars use quite a bit power going in those roads, so electric current going in those power feed cables would have to be very high and that causes a lot of losses if you are not using also very high voltages, which increases catastrophic accident possibility.
bad for marketing, bad for us that seek out reliable information, bad for reputation (if someone spots it out) etc.
timo 1:30am | jul 21, 2009 wayne p. bishop: your idea of constant torque would be useful, except for one small thing: electric motor torque curve is already flat from 0-several thousand rpm.
first law of thermodynamics energy can neither be created nor destroyed.
i think i heard it was end of march, but want to be sure to see it.
we don't have either magnetic field senses or electric field senses (like some sharks for example, have).
for power density that is something i can understand, but for energy density that is like having one kilo laptop battery that could run 2000 hours straight.
also if you changed that a bit more and ran with a halbach array for the magnets in the generator you may not have to wait on the battery science.
this can quickly become a huge amount of testing as there are so many variables and conditions, but fortunately we have spent quite a bit of time internally building a very accurate computer model of how the roadster will behave under different driving scenarios.
0.35 vs 0.27 allows type s reach same or possibly even smaller air resistance as roadster, while being quite a lot bigger car.
that article is a bit overoptimistic, but comments are good.
that 200kwh equals about 800 mile range.
in a way it's kind of fun to try to explain to the free-energy doofi that tanstaafl, but it's kind of a waste of time.
if car consumes about 17mpg (bmw 750i, comparable to model s) you have 5882 gallons used for 100,000 miles and average one gallon costs about $2.7 (which is really cheap compared to our 1.25 euros / liter) you have $15882.
the cost of producing the extra mechanical bits for a hybrid is several thousand dollars each.
the honda they did love as it is hydrogen and therefore fills in seconds at a pump.
will allow you to re-charge your, tesla motors, battery in 5 minutes. . .
i can gas-up my honda ridgeline in less than 5 minutes to get 370 miles before my next 5 minute fill-up.
this might be a nice franchise opportunity.
you both have the enginers and the ability to make this.
in case of several vehicles charging simultaneously the power required can be a problem for potential charging locations.
you are correct in your comment about gm battery not yet existing.
solar cells on the roof are not worth the extra cost.
we are seeking automotive chassis manufacturers with electronic controls; large scale composite manufacturing assistance (technical, financial) will come from known federal funded centers.
just small city car or expensive toy like roadster is not enough to me.
roy, i read from somewhere that honda is abandoning fc cars in favor of bev just because bev makes more sense.
the same is not true of electric motors or cars, both rely on outside materials for their "reaction mass".
exterior temperature in the winter should be treated as 0 degrees fahrenheit to give a reasonable bad-case scenario.
marco g. carle: tesla motors has started accepting online orders for europe, but with a substantial backlog, it will take awhile before deliveries can be made.
given the times and the importance of this issue grant money wouldn't be hard to come by.
or 4 separate control systems could be used instead of the 4-wheel steering, etc. avoiding one system's extra expense for the other's, if the four-wheel steering would add even more expense.
i really really hope that this isn't some overestimate hype of their batteries.
i wasn't following tesla at all until the roadster first rolled out of the shop in late 2008, so i don't know how much teasing tesla did with the roadster specs before it was actually being produced.
raye, roadster does have insulation.
the funnel at the front is for cooling air for the windings, since most apus are in enclosed spaces.
electricity is available pretty much everywhere, so you can slow-charge in your destination.
a quick calaculation of the distance between stuttgart and munich railway stations comes up with about 200km.
gm is treating the volt just like they treated the ev1, it is a big pr program to show how green they are but they are dragging out introduction and have now announced that they are going to make only about 10000 in the first two years.
personal cars which cost nothing to drive.
for some birds artificial magnetic fields could be harmful (some of those can see earth magnetic field which is many times weaker than even smallest natural magnet magnetic field, they use it for navigating).
yes, the m-s is beautiful.
robert anderson 6:58am | mrt 4, 2009 li-ion batteries permanently lose capacity with time, the amount lost depends on the storage conditions, i.e. temperature and charge percentage.
there are plenty of ways to make that school boy dream work without draining power from source or creating an abundance of heat.
while you are pumping along on the level you need to use the battery or your legs to pump the bike, but the light is on all the time.
but for example for taxi driving with many starts/stops because of traffic ligths and just random but short commutes advantages of regenerative braking make it much more efficient.
the issue about the transmission is not as straight foreward.
i have found a solution that is “hidden in plain sight” within the automotive electrical system.
no, it is an ac induction motor with no permanent magnets.
problem with hybrids with high pure electric range is the weight and size-requirements for battery as well as control unit size combined with weight and size of the other system.
the other fact that is dis-regarded when folk go on about the oil being used to produce the electricity to charge e.v is that often the car batteries will be re-charged overnight on off- peak electricity as it used to be called.
never needing to plug into the power grid.
especially if that screen has multiple modes which means there is no fixed place for any control.
charging type s 300mile 85kwh battery pack would take 425hours with 200w. 300miles / 425 hours gives 0.7miles / hour of charging.
car balance was totally off.
in the controversy over whether the hummer is actually less polluting than the prius, "dust to dust", computer models predict the prius should pollute less than the hummer.
touchscreen does not give you any feedback of where your hand is, ordinary controls do.
future generations will curse us for squandering all the oil reserves.
joey simon: tesla motors solved the "transmission problem" over a year ago, by using a simple single gear transmission and adjusting the voltage to boost torque at low speeds.
a partially discharged battery takes less time than a fully discharged battery.
yes, wind turbines generate electricity, but it takes a really big wind turbine to generate a substantial amount of electricity.
i believe you will be as important as ford once was 100 years ago, very, very soon!
type s in 4wd configuration might be even better in that, because it can use more active braking with front-wheels too.
put 100kg of those in a car and drive 50000 miles without recharging.
i believe using the bernulli principle in combination with permanent magnet motor/generator placed in a vehicle where the accelerated air was then applied to the generator via helicopter blading that had been calculated to offset the weight of the generator and exit the air into the vertical that it would not add exceesive drag.
in longer road trip it doesn't matter if it takes 40 seconds or one hour if you use it maybe once a year.
there is mention for type s that it might have 4wd as option, which i believe would be hub-motors in front and more traditional powerful single engine in back with better efficiency.
a 100w light blub running for 1 hour will use 100 wh of electricity.
if you would like to “play” with these numbers yourself, below is a link to an excel file with the table of data used to generate these graphs.
in my opinion the best thing about telsa motors is their engineering blog site .
i would assume most of the tesla owners have higher expectation in general and appreciate better things in life.
higher energy densities are now in class 200-300mah/g with around 3.5v (translates to 700-1050wh/kg) and even those are not "big news" just ordinary experiments.
electric cars are super efficient and we can use that.
over time with increased demand and sales, the costs will come down and cheaper cars will be built for the rest of us.
biggest i saw was over 2000wh/kg.
the following posts might have the information you're looking for: winter drive testing in arvidsjaur, sweden http://www.teslamotors.com/blog4/?p=55 environmental chamber testing http://www.teslamotors.com/blog4/?p=43 a note on the tesla sports cross country in the middle of winter to the detroit auto show.
that is 84kg battery with 187mile range.
roadster design is pretty close to lotus exige, and as such is made for agility, not speed.
even if we recycle every bit of lithium it might not be enough.
over the life of the car it would almost pay for itself.
the software for control and charging would have to be changed.
about million times more if i remember how much our current energy usage is.
some might argue that we need every bit of regen braking, but i don't see how this kind of aggressive built-in regen helps all that much--if the excessive regen causes a more rapid deceleration than you want , you just have to step on the gas to get back to the speed you wanted to go, using up the regenerated power.
you argument that global warming isn't happening because people still fly on jets is laughable.
i'm not as knowledgeable as i would like to be when it comes to the technology of our future electric cars, but i was wondering if there is any talk about maybe using different conductors for charging and discharging.
i love tesla - the first guys to get their head around the fact that cars in the future will need to be appealing, by that i mean look good and go fast to the point where perhaps mileage/range etc is much less relevant than appeal.
but the government, utilities, and the people need to get the electric supply of the country figured out.
a fully charged ess stores approximately 53 kwh of electrical energy at a nominal 375 volts and weighs 992 lb (450 kg).
robert horning 2:57pm | feb 10, 2009 being a former resident of minnesota, i would have to say that a rock solid endurance test would be to have one of tesla's vehicles spend a winter in minneapolis recharging in some sort of outdoor car port between trips.
80w is quite low conversion btw.
well aparently there was bad weather but the people in the tesla did not notice.
i am also glad to hear that evs are viable in cold climates like montreal.
3) battery charging is what can be done everywhere _now_.
the oil companies encouraged this trend because they know that they will run out of oil and fuel cells have the advantage that they could keep their customers coming to the pumps to buy hydrogen.
it could swim, climb up hills over 50 decree elevation, go in deep snow and swamps, was agile enough to drive fast in forests and generally get pretty much everywhere.
i believe that the tesla offers some real insight and potential for future automotive development.
that requires a slower charge rate when it gets closer to maximum charge.
energy efficiensy of charge/discharge of li-ion batteries is at least 90 %.
that is the rather high built-in regen braking that occurs when you take your foot off the gas.
they have relatively high energy density, are relatively cheap, easy to maintain, and have no capacity degradation over time.
i can't tell how long ago it was removed, as the removal was not dated.
could this be employed in an electric car with some clever electronics to disengage drive during certain conditions.
tesla roadster has also been in real-life accidents (just look at google) and it turns out to protect their passengers very well.
if the grill of a vehicle were to designed to bring air into the vehicle as you drive to run a turbine and generate energy to a back up battery pack, then that battery pack could be used as a reserve.
the batttery pack will most probably last somewhere between 100k and 200k miles.
even a direct crosswind will slightly increase forward moving aerodynamic losses due to its interaction with the body shape.
but there are several technologies that can provide enough power by using some kind of accumulation, e.g. using flyweels as it used in this http://www.pentadyne.com/site/our-products/technology.htmlfukushima 5:09am | mrt 25, 2009 i am a japanese very interested in pure ev.
it claimed this produces poor handling.
not open wheel and not that much lighter either (weights about 900kg which is without batteries more than tesla roadster would weight).
and even if you travel more you will do another 1-2 stops (you will have to anyway, you cant drive 12h without stops or its not very safe) so the big question.
fuel cells also have pretty poor energy and power densities, so just adding more and better batteries and charging them whenever you can makes more sense.
this ivt could be used for a braking system alone.
i watched the tg presentation and was not impressed with the comments by the host.
there is 10 gigawatts of power every day hitting our planet from the sun which is enough to power most cities in the earth.
the only place i have found capacitors is onwww.overstock.com
this a 48v system with max draw 25amps, plus been a very heavy unit.
what you would end up with is station with several full battery packs for each model year and each model type and each manufacturer for it to be able to service all that come to get new batteries.
1080m^2*100w/m^2 is 108000w or 108kw. divided by 30 (cars) gives 3.6kw / car compared to about 100w / car.
if you know any company or have any contacts i would appreciate it very much if you could put me in touch with them.
given the extreme operating environment conditions which an electric car is subjected to like the telsa ev would be , i think , thistelsa battery pack is a catastrophic failure waiting to happen.
wind and solar represent about 2% of the electrical power generated now.
it does not get cold in california.
as we can all see from the charts the aerodinamic drag is the greatest force you need to overcome at highway speeds.
gm volt doesn't exist yet, so it might be that it doesn't get any miles per charge before gm goes bankrupt.
in practice the resistance in the circuit robs energy and the resonance will die to zero, but if it was made of super-conductors, it could store power for a long time.
i know that the electric mini ( http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/08/the_hybrid_mini.php) and the lightning ( http://www.autoblog.com/2008/07/09/lightning-gt-ev-sports-car-coming-thi... ) have motors on each wheel (
a ret hybrid duty cycle is 600,000 miles.
tesla motors designed for high efficiency, which automatically means very little low frequency electromagnetic radiation.
i work at university so i have access to all kinds of scientific materials that you usually would need to buy for free, and i'm just read a lot of those.
they increase complexity of the design which increases cost of the manufacturing 4)
weight is also not a issue here, transmission + shafts don't weight much.
using data from this page shows that for constant 60mph speed roadster needs 75kwh pack to get that same range.
one clear driving “tip” to take away from this is if you are ever nervous about making it to a given destination: you will do much better to slow down instead of speeding up.
there that potential it is transferred to electric motor which converts electricity thru magnetism to kinetic energy.
we may not be able to count on gm to develop it volt due to its financial situations.
could cause severe strain to towing cable or chassis of the roadster though.
fuel cell cars are basically ev:s with pressurized hydrogen storage unit and fuel cell converting that hydrogen to electricity instead of battery.
right now power cost about .12/kwh (how much for a fill up it not free)randal ray mcmullin 3:04pm | aug 11, 2009 i hve an idea to make these electric car's run under their own power.
even if you eliminate *all* losses from system itself (impossibility) you would still have aerodynamic and rolling resistances as well as ancillary systems that generate losses.
also fisher karma will be build here (afaik in same factory that builds porsche boxters).
it looks like a chinese cheap copy of a 'real' sportscar.
i thought to myself that teslamotors can extend the distance of their vehicle with a electric/steam hybrid.
joshua maxwell 8:47pm | mei 19, 2009 the reason i would choose capacitors at the charge site is due to there quick charge/ discharge time and their operational life.
glad that you found my link useful but be careful because the process to make lithium from seawater is not proven technology.
timo again: battery "form factors" are much more easily matched than internal design.
another point of limiting factor is charger cable, which can't be very huge either, otherwise you would need some assistance in connecting it to car.
you car has proven what it set out to prove...simply that electric cars are viable for everyday usage.
the front looks like a mushed in dorky smart car for geriatrics.
you can even generate that electricity yourself by wind, water or solar systems, no need for big companies assuming you live in place you can access those resources.
my best regards, hopping your company gives more good news to the world.
shedding the image of evs as toy cars.
from co2 emission point of view if you use coal you have 38 mj / kg of carbon ( 3.67 kg of co2 per 1 kg of carbon ) which generates 96 g of co2 per every mj of energy.
note that you don't need to use high-price, high energy density lithium-ion batteries, you can use whatever is cheapest in long term.
so here we have almost twice more efficient overall fossil fuel energy use for mechanical driving regardless that we have more complicated energy conversion.
i am a retired sub sailor who has done 3m and subsafe.
it is also important to note that, because the loss is not linear with air speed over the car, you cannot “zero out” the effect of wind by driving in a closed loop course the way you can with elevation changes.
i love these cars, they are the answer to so many of the world's problems, especially the us dependance on middle eastern oil.
a car is different, it relys on friction with the road to provide the "thrust", the slipperiness of the surface makes a big difference, it relys on the road and is not "self-contained".
solar cells on the roof could also be continually charging these offline batteries which would be brought online when there is a need of driving range extension.
while running off the ice regenerative breaking could still be active to provide additional battery charging the main advantage of the reev vehicle is that even with a reduced all electric range (from smaller battery) they would provide a big if not total reduction on our dependence on foreign oil.
but on the other hand constant use of electricity on large scale during driving introduce extra energy conversion with associated losses.
small and nimble and easy to park.
if you think that batteries can't deliver enough wattage you are just wrong.
explanation to everyone else who doesn't speak finnish (which is about 99.9 % of worlds population).
those can then be used with normal sedans too.
it replaces the dense lithium cobalt oxide anode with a lightweight porous carbon material.
what will happen to the cost of them as more and more people are driving electric cars.
getting folks to buy it wilhout trying it for several charges will not be easy especially when an electric costs more than a gas car, the battery pack does not last forever and i assume replacing a battery pack is not cheap.
the cottage is about 3 hours /300km from the city.
an instrument panel warning light (maybe with beeper?) might communicate such a motor failure to the driver.
until they come up with a more common vehicle, tesla is still way ahead of all respectable competition.
a 4-wheel drive version should actually be more efficient.
adapt a battery pack that runs the vehicle and one that stores and transfers energy to the other batteries as you drive.
i would assume that tesla is very well informed indeed.
a 150 mpg ret powered us ngc (new green car) cooper sized, selling to the public should not exceed $6,000.
halbach arrays are great on special tracks for mag-lev vehicles, but are useless for road vehicles.
electric car companies good.
from motor to wheel, power is transferred through its half-axle.
therefore, for optimal efficiency, one would use regeneration if there was a maximum speed that you don't want to exceed and there is probably a speed at which you should probably start using regen to maintain since you wouldn't store much additional kinetic energy anyway.
i watched the programme after it had been broadcast because i had heard it being discussed.
the best way for people to make a difference is to work at the local level to create the infrastructure need for tesla and other ev makers to grow.
i was told a while back there is a way and that they do go faster than 125 mph.
and that becomes your target market as those people will probably be very happy to use a vehicle with such low- cost per mile and a much lower environmental.
they are complex, easy to break machines which creates maintenance costs 3)
i know people could get cancer for using cell phone too
many people have 220 outlets in their garages and in their laundry rooms.
in europe we use 230v system, so my figures might be badly wrong).
as for the "cell phone panic", that was from a single case of a woman who got a brain tumor on the same side that she usually held her cellphone, but consider that there are hundreds of millions of cellphone users, it is statistically inevitable that every year a few of them would get brain cancer, and a 50/50 chance that it would be on the same side that they'd use their cell phone.cablechewer 11:48am | sep 1, 2009
i need backseats and decent trunk too.
i do think that using an electrical system as the power transmission system should reduce costs, power loss, weight, and eliminate that snow catching differential gear box.
roadster 300kg battery would then have 120kwh capacity which is 2.3 times more than it has currently.
that is 100kw which would charge 85kwh battery in about 50 minutes.
i tell this long story, because today a german motor magazine ("autobild": http://www.autobild.de/artikel/tesla-model-s_875572.html) published an article about new tesla model s, and i thougt immideately "thats my next car!"
it severely hurts battery development.
in type s that center console touch-screen is huge.
a roadster that can go 0-60 in 4 seconds and125 mph tops is only a marketing tool to dramatically introduce us to a solution.
200kwh battery pack would be useful, even for longer trips.
ronrobert horning 11:39am | mrt 27, 2009 fukushima's article seems to translate well enough with the bable fish to be able to at least get the basic gist of what is covered...
as it is half the total weight of the car in one piece it might be a bit of a problem.
timo 3:15am | nov 4, 2009 inspired by steves comment i tried to find out how much electricity (energy) is used to refine raw oil to petrol or gasoline.
i know charging like that would be slow (ah shucks - i'd have to stay at the cottage longer :) ), but would the lack of a garage or other shelter be a serious problem if rain or snow rolled in?david e. manwell 1:46pm | sep 1, 2009 to “roy” (august 14th, 2009 at 3:36 pm) my idea doesn’t use “4 single speed transmissions, ... 4 controllers .... (which would) cost more ....” with its “mechanically independent electric motor for each wheel”.
if the demand is greater than the generated power, then all generated power goes to the electric motor plus required extra discharged from the battery.
for example, if gasoline were $3.00 per gallon and a car could travel 30 miles on a gallon of gasoline, then it could do 10 mpd.
alternator collects its energy by slowing down whatever it is connected to, so basically you are proposing to drive with brakes on, which is always bad idea.
in other words it does not use cones, pulleys, belts(steel or otherwise) and is not planetary, toroidal, or incrementally driven.
however, it just wouldn't do to try and drive with the regenerative brakes on all the time!
you don't get very fast to anywhere with about 3kw of power.
also how many dollors will it take for that charge.
thanks again for the kind feedback.
300lbs wheel at 300,000 rpm.
anyway all of these recent articles seem to have at least 400-700wh/kg capacities with 400-500wh/kg tested on full batteries and with high cycleability and power.
too few cars charge in there.
tesla current batteries have something like 120-150wh/kg (not sure how much battery pack casing weights).
it would dramatically reduce some 30%-40% power loss due to the need of mechanical transmission.
with one hour-long break at some servicing station during that trip you get easily 300 mile or more (using current techs) which is then 15 hours of driving at 60 mph average speed + one hour break.
if we drive electrics, that money stays here, in our economy.
i thought i remember the idea that the battery cells would be owned by tesla and exchanged toward the end of their life (treated kind of like a 5yr lease, $1000/yr.
these efficiency differences can’t skew the result that much.
a load test on a dyno, setting the load to simulate the added wieght effect of climbing the grade should give a pretty close estimate.
epa rated the prius at 55 mpg. consumer reports says the prius figures are 20% higher than actual.
the only significant manufacturing difference between electric car and gasoline car is big battery pack.
i have not come across any motels with electrical outlets beside parking spaces.
testing results were posted on this blog, you'd have to go way back in the archives to read it and see the videos.
that drag forces the drive motor to use more electricity, more than the tiny turbine can produce.
you could make high energy density swappable primary battey pack for ev that does the same.
the inboard computer will home in on the nearest station or an individual who wants to make his ramp available for the public.
please read: http://www.teslamotors.com/blog2/?p=24 i have become interested in learning more about this fantastic car after seeing it on an episode of future car.
i don't know how low the price can get on scaled down models, but i am certain it would be less than $25,000 and more likely less than $20,000.
this may be solar, wind or even tidal power stations.
tesla has special tires designed to have lower rolling resistance but still be wide enough to be "sporty", after all it is a sports car.
an electric motor’s torque curve, has its high point as the motor starts, requiring no reduction gears for starting the vehicle rolling.
it would be as revolutionary as your cars, in a different field.
keep in mind that temperatures in minneapolis also get over 100 fahrenheit (+40 celsius) during the summer months, so wide temperatures swings can be expected unless you keep your vehicle pampered in a climate-controlled garage, forcing a further limit on what kind of batteries you may want to use in that environment.
when temperatures get cold.... -40 degrees cold or more .... materials start to get brittle that were much more pliable at warmer temperatures.
so if you are driving into a 10 mph headwind, it is nearly the same as driving 10 mph faster from an aerodynamic loss point of view.
they would be for hybrid for because they have high cycle durability and small battery gives a lot of power.
it's below 0 f today, with snow and ice, and severe winds.
i have a varied background and do not have the credentials of anyone i have read on here.
it is interesting that the oil rich nations are building nuclear power plants -they know that one day it will run out and they are being prudent and building for the future.
so you have an unlimited range and an average saving of 50% to almost 100% on the use of gasoline.
that is quite huge connection.
this configuration will achieve 150mpg h’way on fuel.
the minor advantage in ev performance that would result from removing the weight of the range extender and extra range from installing it might not be worth the hassle of removing and installing the range extender.
additionally even if we just plain start burning gasoline in power plants generated electricity would be cleaner than burning that same gasoline in cars.
even if you only top it up every day, that is not going to help you with the long distances.
problem is that by that time she had driven battery pack to unusable condition.
there is a company called tesla motors, which has been making a car that does just that.
i do not think they shut them down during off peak hours.
since they are the same form factor, building battery packs with these should be easy.
i suspect that the model s might well become the least expensive car capable of doing 0-60 mph in 5.6 seconds, it will certainly be the least expensive 4 passenger sedan with that acceleration, and any gasser with that type of performance will be a terrible gas hog!
i always wondered how efficient are the petrol generators.
what do you think of that?timo 1:46am | aug 14, 2009 john doe: no, high-end electric cars are not made for treehuggers, this is pure business and tesla roadsters are simply high-end sport cars.
that range would be over the breakpoint of making ice permanently obsolete (if it can be made relatively cheap by large scale manufacturing).
looks like even with hills you would be able to do this trip without problems.
a modern diesel car will obtain 40-60 mpg.
the current used to charge the batteries flows on the same conductors used to discharge them, so the net current results in discharge or charge.
may be we will see a lot of 2 seat cars (one behind another), making the profile of the car half size thus allowing not only 2 vehicles using 1 lane but also reducing the power needed to travel at highway speeds almost in half.
joe simone, i agree that plugin hybrid has currently unlimited range and bev doesn't, but when battery tech advances and we get over 600 mile range batteries then things change.
this allows you to determine whether you are freewheeling or using regenerative braking by simply backing off on the 'gas' pedal.
by the way, if integrating an "electric drive" with this ivt would make it very unique.
the numbers may also change a bit after each car goes through some number of break-in miles.
15-30 minutes for 100-200kwh battery pack should be considered fast for a car that _only_ uses those stations during very long road trips.
that way, drivers are not swapping out their battery, they are swapping one leased battery for another.
on the battery's cost side , just look at the statements made by telsa below, and ask yourself would u pay $36,000 for a replacement battery pack after 100,000 miles.
at the last company i worked at they made school buses and factory was about 80,000 sq.ft.
that would really be the end of the internal combustion engine.
covering the car with solar cells increases costs, but adds at most 5 miles a day, so it isn't really worthwhile (that could change if costs drop and efficiency improves).
nuclear power turned out to have some unexpected hazards, we don't want to unleash a new hazard to the world.
this motor generator is the size of a spare tire in the pml mini’s case.
i am not an engineer, just an interested tesla fan that likes finding cool news articles about stuff like this.
timo 12:05pm | jun 24, 2009 bshumberger; if i understand you correctly you are proposing generator (alternator) in the car.
so, any system with a high torque low rpm input and a high rpm output must also have a low torque output as well.
larryallon peterman all the people i know do not have $30,000 to $150,000 dollars to spend on one of your cars.
if you are driving mostly on freeways and do not use brakes almost completely regenerative braking would not be used but energy losses of electric transmission would still be playing.
as the pollutants in the air increase the pollutants go to the arctic areas making the ice black which will absorb sunlight making the earth hotter and melting the ice causing a two or more fold result of super storms that destroy the costal areas and the heating of the earth which will dry out and burn the grass and trees which will cause a loss of oxygen which will cause an increase of death from lack of oxygen.
peak power is usually just after this point (about 8000 rpm for the tesla) .
windmill converts kinetic energy to electricity, but *there are always losses* never opposite.
that is why cm said that comment about nobel prize.
don't forget that they are not mutually exclusive, evs could be designed to work with both swapping and fast charging.
lithium polymer can be shaped into any shape as it is a plastic.
another things are small but still improving like incorporated door handles, flat underbody (which is easy achievable by ev), i even saw a concept of a car which roof was lowering if there is only one passenger in the car making the car lower and with lower aerodinamic profile.
for lightning 10minute charging, that is entirely possible if you plug it directly to power station.
that's 10kw. roadster would use around 50 kw at steady 100mph.
you just end up losing energy, that's all.
problem with range is not efficiency (if you look at the top of this page, only drivetrain losses are something that can get significantly smaller).
using these appliances is not out of performance, just range.
timo 9:41pm | apr 22, 2009 andrew may, any wheel-mounted generator works like brakes.
i would have loved to see their faces when they realised they were so so wrong.
presently electrical power is supplied from 50% coal burning, 20% natural gas,20% nuclear and 7% hydro and the rest from oil, wind and solar.
as a matter of fact i had an idea back in the 90's and was pretty sure that if i put torque on this system in a certain way that i would get a particular result.
of course, they had to make their point even more blatant by creating a the straw-man of charging the tesla with a small windmill.
the engineers needed are hard to come by.
what that windmill would actually do is generate electricity from work done by the car, and as so causes more work for car to do.
electricity can be produced completely without oil, and soon it will.
a ret propelled cooper type sedan would get 150 mpg.
i am really asking because this has me puzzled and wish somebody could explain it to me.
it could still be mounted on a wall, just with the cord plugged into the side or bottom of it.
it is reasonable to expect consumers to pay $100k for a technologically advanced performance car, and i don't expect to reach 100000mi anytime soon, nor have problems with the more than adequate range, but a five-year life expectancy for a major cost part replacement is personally not acceptable.
even at best case you would be getting something like 1000w/m^2, and thin film solar cells have about 15% conversion rate, so with 3m^2 of panels in car you could get max 3*1000*0.15 = 450
the tesla battery is more than 3 times bigger, and heavier than the volt battery.
power use would be billed directly by your local utility company, and would show up on your home bill.
i have seen.mark howarth 2:04pm | dec 29, 2008 i was interested to look at top gear testing the tesla, but was disappointed that he was untruthful about the cars ability.
that storage needs to be high energy density batteries, otherwise you just don't have enough energy to get anywhere.
setting up maned recharging stations every 100 miles on the interstate that are stock with precharge batteries will bring in more customers and huge additional revenues.
ancillary losses are caused by all “other” electrical loads in the vehicle, particularly the 12v cooling blowers and pumps, the 12v radio, internal and external lighting, etc.
the electric bike's power to weight ratio would certainly make for a thrilling uphill ride, complete with all natural rushes of adrenalin.
you can probably leave heat decipation and other items needed , at the car all time, and make only the actual engine block removable, (fuel pumps, reservoir and stuff can also stay at the car at all time as they would be small).
one of the most common and tricky experiments is testing how far the roadster will go on a single charge in various driving conditions.
should be about 250 million and even that figure is overkill, because some of the cars don't drive every day.
assume there is 30 cars in parking lot in typical office building, which is as large in sideways as the parking lot and is square in shape with usable roof for solar cells about 30% you get about 3600m^2 * 0.3 =
batteries would still end up being recharged.
typical commute is about 40miles / day.
the tesla is already using divises to cool the batteries.
it is nice when in a remote location to be able to get home and not freeze.
hub motors).roy 2:36pm | aug 14, 2009 don't forget that 4 motors, single speed transmissions, and controllers cost more and weigh more than 1 motor and 1 controller.
the roadster didn't include a "swappable" battery, as it was enough of a challenge just to make this new type of battery pack work right, without having to worry about swapping.
by increasing life, i suppose you mean number of charge cycles, not range per charge.
perhaps a swap station could measure any power left in the existing battery pack and reduce the payment for the fresh battery pack accordingly i envision the charge for a battery swap being just a few dollars - the $4 the faq says is the average cost of the electricity that goes into charging a battery pack plus a profit margin.
they are wired in parallel, not series in a tube.
as the relatively scarce raw materials, used to manufacture the batteries, come under higher and higher demand, the price of the battery will increase rapidly.
this would be a trailer with a small (smat car?) engine and fuel tank attached to a generator with a special trailer plug that talks directly to the pem.
they are dead weight reducing performance.
it imports 12 million barrels of petroleum a day or 60%.
sometimes the harm could be simply offset by the joy from the driving experience.
so it is not false to say that roadster does not burn oil.
working on increasing battery packs will not help a lot.
i’ve talked with many people who intuitively think that minimizing time to the destination will also minimize the energy usage, but just the opposite it true!
i think there is what confuses you: with your rockets you are applying constant power, but because energy is power * time you are not applying constant energy.
that means 10 hour drive with 60mph average speed.
the race would be more profitable for participants than formula 1.
when electricity is cheap, clean and abundant, and when batteries / capacitors / hydrogen is/are cheap, light, small and rapidly rechargeable, no one will care about efficiency.
you could get some energy from actual *wind* (not that air displacement that car causes when it moves like people here suggests) using sails if wind is blowing from behind, but i don't think you want sails in fast sportcar.
i would think a heater for northern climates could make sense.
with these rules you can not charge the battery and run the motor from the battery concurrently you do one or the other.
obviously, battery swapping would only be used on vehicles designed for it, and swapping would not be done on evs that were not designed for it.
any system that increases the rpms without changing the power must reduce the torque, and vice versa.
when you go down hill, you no longer have to pump, but just coast for miles ,and the light works all the way down the hill, using the inertia of the weight of the bicycle to generate electricity to propel you along, and light the way.
we do have geared magnetic transmissions in use in australia, they power solar pumps in remote locations.
sometimes on these trips, it can be a problem finding a gas statin that is open, right at the time i need to refuel.
no necessity for major infrastructure changes like with hydrogen and other alternative energy solutions.
that charging can be made longer because that is not something that you need to _drive_ your car every week or so to fill up.
it seems to me that the best kind of regen braking is that generated by the brake pedal--which the roadster doesn't have.
problem is energy storage.
alternator connected to emotor is just brake connected to motor.
era of gas guzzlers is over, what you see now in roads are last remnants of obsolete tech.
the top-back and top-front window could come optional with a sev solar panel like the toyota prius does, increasing mileage and decreasing recharge time and energy cost.
the lines are just beautiful, the technology cutting edge, something all enthusiasts will be proud of.
why not put a generator of sufficant size on an electric car connected to the drive train so as the wheels turn ( dams have been useing this technology for more then my or your lifetime ) it will be charging the battery by creating eletricity giving the car an almost unlimited distance .
of course there would be constant loss by refrigeration needed, so that would not be very ideal for saving energy, but it could be useful as energy storage.
tesla is rear only drive primarily to keep the cost down as a second motor and controller for the front would raise the price and also increase the weight slightly.
it seems that everyone is stuck in the gas/electric hybrids; maybe it's time to break the paradyme.
you don't need power station, just battery to battery charging for high wattage charger.
i used to bicycle to work in silicon valley, about 13 miles each way, and would pass my car-driving coworkers several times during the trips.
100,000 units could be a pre-sold beta test, factory would be sized for over 1 million units, flexibly manufactured, readily available, land with lots of incentives.
only good thing in those is that they can be charged fast, but because charging speed is really limited by connection that doesn't matter.
one of the pdf-files i found says something interesting: "developed for formula one".
the popular media then took that and hyped the heck out of it, telling people we had "global cooling", while conveniently forgetting to mention the 20,000 year time frame!
but just adding the additional battery capacity of the model s will improve the range dramatically at highway speeds.
that means only 68 % of that energy figure goes to produce ice fuels.
joao resende 3:07pm | jul 9, 2009 since batteries do not last "forever" and have their cycle of charges, how much could cost their replacement for new ones?timo 10:37pm | jul 13, 2009 to tesla engineering and top dogs there: i contacted fortum (finnish/swedish energy company) in order to question if there are any of the charging points they are building between my home and my parents home and what voltages and amps they use.
now if someone develops a material that is superconductive at room temperature, then that would be of interest.
in large quantities i found a web site that offers them at $5 each.
of course you could really stretch it and point out that polymers come from coal and/or oil so tesla is again guilty of false statements because of the materials from which their vehicle is made.
anyway, looks promising for me.
bev is now reaching breakpoint in battery tech and after that ice is just obsolete.
think out of the box, and bring new solutions to old problems.
yes, using four separate, but electronically coordinated, control systems could keep all wheels delivering enough torque to supply power instead of coasting, but would add some expense.
you can start with hand-cranked 5w motor and end up giving energy to entire world.
but i must admit i am slightly disappointed with the design… it looks like a chinese cheap copy of a ‘real’ sportscar.
problem: looking at nice and slick car, i just do not see big electrical cable for charging battery being "sexy".
don't cut your range much (maybe about 5%-10% max), but icy and wet road surface might do worse.
wose i notice when i am in the mountains, i have a lot of up hill driving, and then a lot of down hill driving.
the energy needed to power that refrigeration is several times greater than the small amount of power saved through improved motor efficiency, it would be a big step backwards.
just standard three-phase high-amp connector could charge roadster-size battery pack in something like half a hour, and you can go much higher voltages safely.
with near future 600+ mile range bev are real future.
that would allow both non-leading wheels to track directly behind the wheel ahead, giving each the same turning radius.
nb if the government provides $4,500 cash for clunkers at the right timing, (again) then a ret ngc would cost the consumer$1,500.
generators, capacitors and voltage regulators in conjunction can accomplish this.
with this type system, you still would have to charge on occasion, but less often.
i lived then, and still do live in snow country.
" i'd like to point out that, despite how much a curmudgeon i must sound on this forum, i am an inveterate gadget head.
theoretically this would also extend range / charge.
been trying to find info to verify, but so far no luck.
so any breakthrough or new designes there will bring fruits for the ev's.
so 60*0.12 = $7.20.timo 8:57pm | aug 11, 2009 xcraft: i don't work at tesla, so they are not "my batteries".
therefore i sometimes get the impression the diffsion progress is beeing constrained.
wolfram hagen hallo, is it possible to use some trailer with battrypacks to get the chance to travel more than 1000 miles without recharching?timo 8:38am | aug 19, 2009 moderator: i just read some comments on www.worldchanging.com/archives/005118.html and checked them vs your website.
apparently they will be producing large format prismatic lithium iron phosphate batteries.
"i also asked whether they thought about using in-wheel motors, since putting a small motor in every wheel instead of having one big motor with a drivetrain connecting it to the four wheels can greatly reduce mechanical complexity and weight, as well as improving reliability.
i have traveled all over the world and have family members working for the un on sustainability and environmental projects.
then again that might actually mean that global average driving speed is 18mph :
same centers could provide services to park bev for a day or few days.
first of all you don't need one feet cable for 200kw, you would, if you use low voltage and high amps.
the thrust(force applied) to the rocket is independent of the rocket's speed.
miles per watt/hr is much more intuitive (at least to me) because its closer to "mpg(miles per gallon)", and defines vehicle range ultimately by battery capacity.
ford and nissan have the financial and manufacturing might to get ahead of tesla, but that's years down the road - tesla got the jump on them.
power density also would be very good, otoh also lithium batteries have got in totally new figures in it from new invention: 175kw/kg (no that is not a typo, it really was 175 _kilo_watts / kg) with 60mah/g batteries.
it seems easy to have a tesla car in canadas north.
also hydrogen is extremely poor method of transporting energy because hydrogen leaks out from any container (hydrogen molecyle is basically just two protons surrounded by two electrons, so if that molecyle loses those electrons those protons go just straight thru any material), it compresses badly and itis extremely explosive.
that could change if costs drop or power output improves.
the ac can be useful in a heat pump mode.
swapping batteries is like swapping gasoline tank.
even the tires will vary slightly from batch to batch.
i also searched shortest road to my desination which turned out to be 589.4 km or around 370 miles.
forget digital displays etc.
just drive to the nearest guideway entrance, punch in your destination, then you could relax, read, play games or snooze until you got to your designated offramp, where you'd once again take control and drive to your final destination.
bshumberger 2:01pm | jun 30, 2009 i have tried to present a solution that i beleive will dramatically increase the range of an electric vehicle.
overall efficiensy from fossil fuel to mechanical energy coming to wheels would be 40 % worst case and 50 % average.
but otherwise with swapping of leased packs questions of battery life limitations, slow charge and other complications of batteries could be solved in a way that regular bev drivers should not handle them much.
dimitris; tesla ess is very safe, and designed to disengage in case of accidents.
of course that battery seems to be rather durable so it might not need as heavy casing and complex environment control system.
so if you want to be able to recharge 200kw/h for 1h you will need 200sq/mm cable.
please deleted this bracketed portion for posting] that hadles heavy equipment tires, they would have no problem with a lightweight item of only 1/2 ton.
so if you reduce speed during driving or if you go downhill in electric vehicle you reuse at least 50 % of that energy back to driving.
roadster battery pack weights about 450kg.
if not a wind turbine, then why not utilize the wheels to generate that ebergy to booster a second battery pack?timo 11:45am | apr 26, 2009 curt helland, tesla is continuously checking new technologies for batteries and selects what is best compromise between price, reliability and energy density.
now, with two wheels sharing that duty, both inside-track wheels carrying the same load, and only the outside track's wheels coasting,only half as much power per wheel is needed, allowing smaller motors.
2700kw peak sounds like a solar power plant to me.
on another note, a recent government energy report stated that california gets 20% of its electricity from renewables (wind, solar, geothermal), another 20% from hydro, and only 20.1% from coal.
250km/h top speed, 0-100km/h under three seconds, 0-200 under seven seconds, 400km range.
you end up losing power.
timo 8:45am | jul 9, 2009 ken, ultracaps are more useful than ordinary regenerative braking only at emergency braking-fast energy gains.
that's a better solution than a "range extender" engine.
but it is not fair to compare absolute worst case for electric car with absolute best case for gasoline car.
timo 11:50am | apr 2, 2009 joe simone, seems that you found out yourself how big gm volt battery is.
they have a working agreement with solarcity and there is a link in the left hand column.
the proverbial cart is before the horse, in my opinion.
one good thing is that they really can be used to collect nearly all braking energy, but otoh so can best batteries too.
i calculated using two square meters as my base figure and got that 200w. using your figure i would get only 160w with perfect conditions.
for the rocket analogy to work, the car "thrust" would have to be independent of the road and determined solely by torque and rotational speed of the wheels, which is obviously not the case, otherwise the speed of the car would have no relation to the rotational speed of the wheels!
you want about 10kw of panels.
the cable size would roughly be 1.5 inches in diameter to handle a 200 amp @ 1700 v this would charge the a 85 kw vehicle in about 15 min.
the only difference between battery packs in that case based on chemistry would be total capacity.
also using 2 fuses pr cells seems like a waste of money and weight.
wow an 300-400 cubic engine will be able to produce the needed 15-20 kw of power and i bet it will be probably under 35kg.
a consequence of having the transmission is that the torque is mulitplied.
solar charging units can be designed and sold along with these cars so that average joes can drive to and from work each day and pay nothing to recharge their cars.
problem is, it takes some mechanical effort to produce electricity and the amount of mechanical effort needed is directly proportional to the electrical power produced.
i have also read what inconvenient can be a gas electric compared with and all electric car, that someone says your company posted in your home pagem, and it sounds contradictory.
as you can see from the graph, this can have a huge impact on overall wh/mile with even very small changes in wind.
they are 22% more efficient in transmitting power (compared to mechanical gears) and they never wear out.
divided by 30 car owners you could get $10k to pay.
that is the same effect that a rocket has on propelling a missile to higher and higher speeds increasing its kinetic energy.
i have been going around import companies and asking them if they know about electric cars and they look very puzzled.
added benefit to this could also be the use of a heat exchanger to aid cockpit/battery heating in cold climate conditions which would aid reducing the demands on vehicle batteries as it could provide the power to it's own electric fan, boosting it own efficiency.
thank you to all who have put in so much of yourselves into tesla motors.
the main success info of the said news contents is that inserting the li conducting barrier between the anode and cathode electrolyte realizing the continuous reaction at the anode by preventing from the sourcing of the harmful solid chemical component to the anode.
i don't think chevy volt will ever be very successful, it is obsolete already.
it might really stress the towing equipment and attachment points as well.
if we can get just to the 600 mile range while the electric car is still a niche market, beyond 500 miles, many people would just fly anyway.
the tesla, despite having a 125mph top speed went round their test track faster than a porsche 911 gt3 rs (996).
national, international markets, workers, green enthusiasts/ promoters, us cmcl/govt fleet sales, foreign cmcl sales.
future is also solar and geothermal and other non-polluting energy sources.
please reply to me to know if this plan is sound, so that i may build my confidence of one day seeing a tesla (the sweetest, hottest, most useful car on earth) with my own 2 eyes on these roads.
it is inspiring to see what can be done, and dream about what might be done.
vast amounts of energy can be moved using these ultra capacitors or even trickle charges.
a store where you can connect an additional pak, and not as renault a complete set, so you everytime energy for "local" drive and possiblities for long drive.
because we have such an entrepreneurial and highly technical customer base, many of these experiments are quite detailed and attempt to answer questions that we have in some cases never discussed publicly.
oh yeah, it is a high end sports car, a niche car, too expensive at $100,000 to be considered a viable replacement for use as a taxi.
also paying that $12,000 at any one time is too much for many people.
let's say you have two batteries, and the generator charges one while the electric motor uses the other.
in any process, the total energy of the universe remains the same.
i know it is logical to think that because electric motors are already 90+% efficient the answer must be to increase the energy source (battery storage) however the engineers are completely ignoring one important part of the whole system and that is the "method" in which the mechanical energy developed be the electric motor(which is very efficient) is "transmitted" to the vehicle.
i like to coast along in my golf tdi on the undulating surfaces.
partially walking in extreme terrain, partially driving like car when possible.
one also has to consider that when we start getting a large amount of our vehicle power from the power grid we would have to substantially increase it capacity.
it simply has a single controller and “all-electric power train” for the entire vehicle.
the charger and the car would talk and confirm a safe connection and the line is clear for power to be transmitted.
dear tech folks: i don't know anything about anything, but i came across an article in elektor magazine recently about a lithium-air battery being developed at the university of st. andrews that i thought was promising: http://www.elektor.com/news/lithium-air-battery-with-enormous-capacity.1... best wishes to your team, dan.
to make the guiness record they had to finish 2 round-trips in under an hour and had to replace all the cells for each run what i want from the tesla: 1.
he probably showed my blog to someone(engineer) that said it was impossible and that was that.
joe simone 6:12pm | apr 1, 2009 gm's volt is planning to us a 375lb battery pack yielding 16kwh for a 40 mile range verses the roadster's 1000lb 55kwh battery pack for a 244mile range.
the best aspect of such a system is the logical expectation that the federal and state highway depts would be obliged to build the umbilical dollie grids into our interstate system, and that your product can adapt to it with minimum modifications to it.
i want people to, wait for it, actually go to places with the car, give an insight on real range, good/bad points about the car.
it is untrue that if you have standard buttons, everything is better.
200wh/kg is not anything extraordinary.
i hope battery tech has advanced so that 400 mile range battery is option when your car is available here.
i feel that they have a vested interest in seeing the electric car fail and will do anything to scupper the rise of the electric car.
when ibm first heard about notebook thin computers they did not believe it.
for gasoline we have 45 mj / kg of fuel ( 3.14 kg of co2 per 1 kg of fuel ) making 69 g of co2 per every mj of energy.
the article said that if they were designed today that with today's technology they could be very efficient.
my garage is enclosed but not heated.
batteries are the thing that take space in electric boats, but like they do for cars they get smaller for boats too.
each of these loss components has very different characteristics and is affected in different ways by making real world changes to the vehicle.
1/ oil is running out and environment protected areas have to be destroyed to get the last drips.
the amount of gas required for the 4 or 5 hrs this would require is enormous, and heavy.
using that number you can calculate an interesting driving range curve for various speeds.
disconnecting would cause tether to swing.
think about what happens if that five-meter tether disconnects from roadster at high speeds.
but i'm not sure i would sacrifice the visual appeal of a nice paint job for a few extra watts of power.
your onboard wind turbine would also present its own friction.
the source and sink must be out side the object doing work.
the only way to finance new expensive technology is to start with high-end products.
so much dependence on a video screen is worrying.
even the prius has brake-pedal-actuated regen braking.
i'm sure the suspension is engineered well for driving on the streets and should be great fun to drive there.
a car powered by an gasoline internal combustion engine has a "pump to wheel" efficiency of about 15%.
in optimal case you would get zero, zilch, null, 0, increase in range.
2000 charging stations would easily cover the entire usa.
if you move away from to power source and *then* change rpm you change torque.
the outputs of this model run are in battery energy usage per mile.
i voted for you at design news' "engineer of the year", and not just because you had the best hair.
at least i don't know any refill points for hydrogen fuel cells.
then noticed that tesla is offering battery replacement for 10000€ in seven years.
i love the openness with which tesla conducts business - it is so hard to even get a drag coefficient out of the likes of honda and ford.
it also thrashes the chemistry of most batteries (especially lead-acid batteries) and their ability to take a charge is significantly reduced at lower temperatures.
assume that the headlights are on (due to rain or snow) constantly, and assume that the heater has to keep the car heated at 68 degrees fahrenheit.
that's why electric cars' batteries must be eventually be recharged, which adds some energy from an external source, to replace energy lost.
silicon is, if i recall correclty, second most abundant mineral in earth crust.
however, this is just one data point; real-world range can vary substantially depending on driving style, environmental conditions, and usage of accessories such as the electric cabin air conditioning system and the electric cabin heating system.
one billion cars with 200kg battery packs is 200 billion kg.
conversion cost from fuel to heat is much higher when you run it through the electrical grid, and the in vehicle battery.
your batteries are literally in charge mode as you coasted down hill, and would not be used but only charged by the inertia.
on wed., jan. 21, 2009, i had the pleasure of meeting a gentleman (at the dentist office) & in our conversation, he told me that his son is an electrical engineer for your company.
likewise, solid crystals, the most organized form of matter, have very low entropy values; and gases, which are very disorganized, have high entropy values.
in situations, like cornering, where wheels are temporarily turning at differing rates, one wheel (the slowest) provides the power while the others coast.
60 miles and $4 a gallon = 6.7 cents a mile 40 miles and $5 a gallon = 12.5 cents a mile which adds up to you should not assume the higher buying price and hence higher depreciation on an ev will be regained by lower running costs.
## mark melocco wrote on december 24th, 2008 at 4:53 pm ## i would have thought that the best way to enable long distance touring in the roadster and model s is to design a reev (range extended electric vehicle) trailer.
installing generator to electric engine slows engine down as much as generator creates energy + energy losses.
for as long as i can remember i have dreamed that one day a competitive battery driven vehicle would be built.
solar cells are much better used in buildings and solar power plants than in cars.
i am flabbergasted that none of the financial supporters of telsa have not asked or demanded answers to critical issues of useful life of battery packs, and fast charging.
su is for driving back.
the future is allready here, just look arround, portuguese cientists invented the "ion jelly" i think this would be the secret to obtain real good bateries.
this is a major design flaw.
the right answer is medium-fast charging (say 1 hour for 200 miles worth of charge).
you have a great product, make it better and it will sell.
assuming regenerative braking has same efficiensy as acceleration overall acceleration/deseleration energy retrun would be 40% to 50%.
bob beyers: shallow discharge puts less stress on the battery than deeper discharges, so frequent charging will actually improve battery lifespan.
one small 2 seater (one behind other) city vehicles which will double the density in the cities and one family saloon car for the long trips.
battery swapping just isn't viable business, there will be too few customers to keep it alive.
u.s. auto makers would go from bloated aristocratic idiots, to global industry leaders.
for electric rates of 10 cents per kwh, that would come to 2.4 cents.
where standard otto cycle engines get about 20% efficiency, atkinson cycle engines get 30% efficiency, but at the cost of low end torque, which is offset in the prius by the electric motor.
hence the real "fuel consumption" of an ev is (expensive) battery wear pluss (cheap)electricity.
so with proper recycle of electric vehicle batteries at the end of life point most of the materials would come back to new electric car batteries.
as far as logistics the business side should be immediately apparent.
smart engineering may get another 10% to 20% or so.
this gentleman's name is paul, i do not know his last name.
that means that we have "slow charging points" in pretty much every residential parking slot and many office parking spaces too.
brian h 12:41am | jun 5, 2009 electric vehicles would fit very naturally into a digital public personal transit service; digital control of a fleet of computerized cars that go to your home and take you where you want to go, then head off for the next passenger.
but there is ate least one of the major power companies building charging points (slow ones) around major cities, and when i contacted them in order to find out if there is one between my parents home and my home they told me that there is europe-wide standardization going on for ev chargers and they are investigating techs to charge cars in 10 minutes (didn't say how big battery though).
huge improvement over tesla current batteries.
in that case electric cars number in mass scale use would grow explosively until almost compete turn around with gasoline cars.
timo 8:46pm | aug 11, 2009 john, roadster battery pack is about 54kwh pack, and with losses charging takes little bit over 60kwh.
pretty much any modern battery can be charged in a hour.
obviously most tesla owners will avail themselves of a more utilitarian charge rate.
battery swapping is like swapping gas tank.
you need to use charging station _only_ in long road trips.
the base model s should have a 165 mile range per charge, but extra batteries can be added under the floor to increase range up to 300 miles, and they can be fast charged in about an hour or "swapped" for fully charged packs for drivers in a hurry.
i will grant you, in advance, that its all wheel drive might seem best suited to an suv but, it won’t hurt a roadster or sedan to have it either.
electricity is available pretty much everywhere.
in fact there is no other reason to use fossil fuels than that those are cheaper then renewable sources.
to put a fine line on it, it does not charge and discharge simultaneously, but generated power goes directly to the electric motor and any extra charges the battery.
even heavy vehicles like 18 wheelers.
so it is good to make sure that you are not “accidentally” carrying extra weight in the trunk or elsewhere if you are trying to get the best range possible.
sandor: the tesla roadster uses a 3 phase induction motor http://www.teslamotors.com/blog4/?p=45 http://www.teslamotors.com/blog4/?p=67 kristian solstad wrote on december 23rd, 2008 at 2:02 am i have not seen the specs for the high power plug what makes this charge in only 3.5 hours ?
any thoughts on this?peter sloan wow, great stuff to be able to study.
i guess the issue that i see is that if you plan on moving and the charging station is hard wired into your house you need an electrician to come and remove it and re-install it at a new site.
better to use extra batteries.
if adding backseats become too heavy, at least try and do something about that unattractive front end!cm 12:15am | okt 5, 2009 timo, to increase the range from 300 to 400 miles would mean increasing the range by 25%.
g.m. gustke 10:23am | okt 27, 2009 i hope that you could consider removable batteries that recharging station could replace.
the more there are bev:s in roads the more interest they draw from power companies too.
yes, the climate on earth is always changing.
i wish there were comparable graphs for a competitive sports car, such as the porsche, but i doubt few auto companies area as forthcoming as tesla.
timo has responded the best way he/she could .
that's certainly better than three to five hours and gives me hope that something like a five minute quick charge may be possible in the future.
with almost instant recharging you should be able to recoup a significant amount of spent energy through the dynamic braking system, they have a longer life than any current battery and they're more efficient.
joe simone 9:12am | jul 31, 2009 wayne bishop: "the rockets are burning(expending) the same amount of fuel every second and thrusting with the same force, and therefore the same torque, as it did at the lower rpms and even at 0 rpms.
i know it sounds impossible but believe me it can be done.
especially when you can do pretty much that same cheaper with battery to battery charging where you transfer only electricity which is constant and non-changeable.peo 12:36am | feb 12, 2009 hello jb, thank you for a very comprehensive explanation!
in a way you are decreasing radius of the rotating object: same thing as when you use your bicycle and switch to larger rear cogwheel to smaller one in order to increase rear wheel rpm without needing to increase input rpm.
note that a rocket is a self-contained system, it does not need to "push against" anything outside it, which is why it works fine in the vacuum of space.
the thing that would keep this from happening is the completely and hugely different infrastructure.
timo 4:05am | okt 29, 2009 just found confirmation of my first impresstion that type s is more slippery than roadster: http://green.autoblog.com/2009/03/26/tesla-model-s-50-000-ev-sedan-seats... "...and the s has a cd of about .27 vs. the roadster's drag coefficient of .35.
timo 8:02pm | okt 26, 2009 rawsteel, that kind of portable generator has been proposed before and it isn't that bad idea.
tesla charger is 75a at 230v so 13a would take 3.5hrs * 75/13 = 20 hrs.
sweet! rrroy 8:03am | jan 31, 2009 i am surprised that the new roadster sport doesn't have improved batteries, at least as an option.
could be fitted with several different weapon platforms.
prius efficiency is also due to the atkinson cycle engine.
at 70mph drivetrain is the next biggest power consumer.
i want to be the first one to buy one from costco for under $300.00.
we one could have say ~400 kg pack so that we have ~30 kwh with steady power up to ~300 kw.
it says here that the tesla will reach a top speed of 125 mph.
any way we find to provide a infrastructure to support ev transportation would be a step in the right direction.
the battery has a built in heating/cooling system.
we are in fact targeting electric car/scooter transmissions now, and will exhibit at the hannover show in germany this april.
in fact up to 90 % of that energy could be reused back to driving with proper design.
but it has one driving trait that i hope is not passed on to the model s (i am customer #717 for the s).
the more range you put to your e-car the more kw/h you will need to recharge it and we are getting to big numbers here.
i just calculated random few of them using that datasheet and got something like max 150wh/kg, which is pretty much same as what roadster is using now.
a paradigm changing affordable, automotive suite of products, will not want for stakeholders.
all cars have four wheel brakes.
to blame tesla for the total lack of forethought in the energy program of the usa is foolish.
i'm a university student in korea.
there is one blogger bill arnett that has much better pictures.
re long trips: for the next several years people will accept the fact that they will usually be better off driving a gas powered car for long trips.
t.joe simone 5:58am | jun 17, 2009 auke hoekstra thanks for the input on the “lighting car”.
now, i suppose you could put bicycle pedals on the passenger side, connected to an alternator, but with the limits of human power, that would mean an awful lot of exercise for very little distance!bshumberger 9:39am | jun 27, 2009
i do not think you can assume "similar efficiency to the roadster".
if you say that maximum charging rate is 16.8kw then you get infinite range with infinite kwh battery with speed/acceleration that uses less than 16.8kw. maximum discharge energy from battery is 55kwh, but with range extender energy would obviously be more than that.
it charges faster due to no loses and minimal components.
omg it was the best experience ever.
also there is small scale ev conversion project going on that is in its final stages (http://www.sahkoautot.fi/eng).
bill korea 12:10pm | sep 16, 2009 i think tesla motors has done an excellent job engineering a great car, but the single thing that makes the product impractical for me is battery longevity.
how glad i'll be to finally wean myself from gas stations once i can afford my first tesla.
it is also very light weight.
you make it sound like there is more charging infrastructure in finland than there is here.
the us uses 20million barrels of petroleum a day.
ultimately, ownership of the batteries would be part of the dealer/recharge system, so that the car owner would not care so much about the condition of the new pack he was getting each swap, as long as it had enough charge to get where he needs to go.
think about it: if you can keep torque and increase rpm in same time you are generating more power, which means more energy.
you'll reach thermal limits and the controller will reduce power.
117wh/kg 16/53 = 0,301 40/244 = 0,163 weaker energy density, and much weaker range probably because car itself has aerodynamically poor design and it has to drag along excess weight from internal combustion engine.
such overhead feed lanes could be built for both passenger vehicles and separate ev semi-trucks like the new ones at long beach harbor.
engine is very efficient 97%+ at best, 85% at minimum, so losses come mainly from drivetrain electronics and mechanical friction of gearing and shafts.
easier would be build inductive coils under pavement and get power from there, but that also has problems one and two, and i think problem two is the main concern here.
one power costs to charge it per mile, two cost of parts to repair one including bat.... cost and disposal fee etc. .
presented data about drivetrain losses make it possible to compute overall battery to wheel energy efficiensy.
the lift equation can be used to calculate blade size to offset the permanent magnet alternator/generator weight.
if you are wanting to drive very long road trip, then you just need larger operating radius.
they have a deep intuition that if they're just clever enough they can cheat physics and arithmetic.
remember if you have battery to battery charging one battery needs to be charged which means the once the station has used all of it batteries for charging it will close for the day limiting the number of cars that can be charged.
see http://www.flytheroad.comtimo 10:25am | mrt 5, 2009 mark melocco, i think that was the "car", or some model of that car, they drove in that top gear episode.
if it is round trip, then 600 mile range would be quite sufficient.
i think cabin heat beyond electrical waste heat should be via liquid fuel, not battery.
the point this misses is that power consumption is far greater during the daytime hours than at night.
so one way of lowering that is to make the cars smaller.
now, attach a normal transmission which increases torque and drops rpm back to what it was by normal gearing and use that to run 20w generator.
if there was a danger from electrical radiation i hope your home is insulated there is more power running through your home and down your block than produced by the batteries in the tesla roadster.
cars are also otherwise safe too, there has been real life accidents already with roadster and those have shown that they are safe cars to drive.
brian h 5:55pm | okt 16, 2009 cm; i think i first read that 700 delivered a couple of months ago.
that leads to the major problem with the electric cars.
the other motor and its fuel make a mass and volume trade-off.
if you did not try to spread misinformation and you are just curious if bev is greener than conventional car then i urge you to read some more or just believe that bev is greener than conventional car.
note that because there is friction which increases as speed increases that would not mean that you could accelerate from 60-120 as fast as you could go from 0-60.
a lot of talk about batters and what could be done, but i have not read where someone has tried it first before writting about what the company could or should do, i am very intrested in ev, so what i have done, to add a plus to my story is i went and brought an electric 1500w hub motor scooter as a test bed with 4 x 50ah lead batteries with a top speed of 46kph and a full charge range of 55-60km.
because of my family, we are very knowledgeable about "green tech", and currently i live in thailand.
the other option is quick charging stations, pull up to the quick charge at a location and plug in.
coolant is pumped continuously through the ess both when the car is running and when the car is turned off if the pack retains more than a 90% charge.
and as the number of cars increases the tradeoff becomes even more favorable.
there are battery techs that can give several thousand cycles with over 90% capacity so 410 is reasonable.
no gasoline engine,no motor oil, no transmission, no gas tank, no emission-what is there not to like.
let us embrace new technology -those who don't evolve end up extinct .
three hour drive there and back is six times...lets make 70mph average speed so there is some margin... 6*70 = 420 miles.
actually, all things considered, i imagine the efficiency of manufacturing for this car surpasses the big three.
co2 pollution today has zero associated cost for polluter.
you definitely want to avoid "fully drained", just like avoiding an empty tank in a gasser.
just too tiny surface area.
if you can prove your impossible claim, you''ll be a serious contender for a nobel prize in physics.
and if you double it again to 60kw you will accelerate to about 107 mph using 4 times as much power as you did at 60mph, yet you’d only travel about 1.8 times as fast.
the straight freeway must be going uphill from home however gradual in order to go downhill to go back home.
the capacitors bank could slow charge from the grid and quick charge to the battery rapidly speeding the recharge time.
future will tellroseland67 1:06pm | feb 25, 2009 timo, correct on the kwh = energy kw = power not really sure what the kw/h designates, maybe just a typo.
although tesla surely maintains tight tolerances in the manufacture of critical parts, even very slight changes in areas such as the magnetic gap inside the motor and mating of the gears will create some significant differences between two otherwise identical cars.
ralph a. davis i wonder what your monster would do if it had a turbine engine fueled by instant steam to drive an electric generator?timo 8:13am | sep 14, 2009 antonio, you forgot in your calc that you won't have all those panels facing sun.
unfortunately, no one makes them and tend to ruin the design as soon as backseats are added.
and also for every 1h of recharge you get 30kw/h or another 150 miles.
matt holm 3:49pm | sep 6, 2009 speaking to reliability and wear and tear, what is the projected warranty time/mileage proposed for the model s?xavier 4:55am | sep 7, 2009 is tesla previewing to give a solution which permit the car to be charged with solar energy.
i’ve talked with many people who intuitively think that minimizing time to the destination will also minimize the energy usage, but just the opposite it true!
driving like a top gear presenter clearly does put you near the 55 miles range, as it happened!
we have a magnetic gear box drawn on cad and so far the static tests look good.
you could gain slightly more by adding hub-motors to front wheels too, but not much more.
i question this since the more charge that is depleted from a capacitor the lower the voltage becomes making its use limited.
finally a new car projects that is incredibly interesting and stands out!
it causes the rocket propelled wheel to rotate at an accelerating rate increasing its kinetic energy.
they should be more responsible and i shall probably write to them again if i fail to get a response.
" i'd say it takes slightly cheaper car with higher range.
those cause air drag which negates the electricity generating effect entirely and then some.
for those who can afford it, this would offer a 31% increase in range.
this ivt can be ratiod down slowly for light braking or quickly for fast braking.
battery to battery recharging model is cheaper (basically same components, only a lot cheaper because you need only one big cheap stationary battery instead of multitude of expensive car batteries), can be used with any battery tech that will ever be invented, and can be used without any standard battery model, only recharging connection would require standardization.
when i get there this is no garage, just a grassy area where the cars get parked.
the result is that tesla and gm are using radically different approaches for plug-in cars, and that requires different batteries.
yet the tesla make and roadster model aren't listed at either, even if you choose the "electric vehicles" category.
one may find them in sky harbor airport in phoenix where they fast charge evs for service work on the airport.
i really really want to see this car and your company succeed .
the design work for making a hybrid is at least several million dollars.
the major power grid fuel comes from: 49% coal, 20% natural gas and 19% nuclear, 7% hydro and 3 % from wind/solar (solar being the smaller).
100a 2000v would be nearly same cable thickness except that you need better insulation.
there is always energy loss due to heat.
11mph average speed is obviously artifact of sitting in traffic jam most of the time and driving very low speeds at city centrals.
this will require imaginative car designs that significantly reduce aerodynamic drag, and provide sufficient performance & best economy at low & high speed.
i have seen and try to keep up with the chemical and electrical battery side of leading science but find it could be awhile.
they would pay services for swapping batteries and they are allowed to trickle charge batteries without swapping as many times as they like.
at the roof of garage that thin-film solar cell would serve better purpose.
they do not have any vision.
thanks, jacob some serious competition to tesla roadster: http://www.ewolf-car.com/index_en.html#/e2 doesn't say price, and based on what it claims that is more a race-car than sport-car.
since then i have seen information on "pancake" permanent magnet generator/motors that might be suitable for in wheel use.
to timo - energy here is an article about the energy requirement to refine petrol from crude oil approx.
this is also a useful recent study into the price of lithium batteries and their competitiveness when build into er-ev's like the chevy volt: http://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/handle/10161/1007 btw i am a great fan of er-ev's
i bet you wouldn't find all the buttons right away.
you wouldn't get very far with that power though.
volumetric are normally about twice as high, so 2kwh/l or 200kwh for 100 liters which would give you range over 600miles (about 705miles with type s efficiency) and is about size of large gas tank.
you are painfully right in suggesting that many americans use cars for short distances, where infrastructure like caltrans, bart or bicycles would be more efficient.
the #1 problem i would see with an electric vehicle in a cold-weather climate like minnesota would be significantly reduced driving range... both from trying to keep the cab warm and from the issues of having a decreased charge in the batteries.
if your engineers and technicians can not figure out how to accomplish this from the concept that i have presented in my previous posts, i would be more than willing to demonstrate this solution in person, for a price.
anyway, the fact is i can show(prove) how it is possible to apply a low rpm torque(motor) to a higher rpm system(wheels) with approximately the same torque (some losses due to friction,etc).
i would be interested to see the wh/mile and range/speed graphs on 2%, 5% and 7% grades.
it would cost $30,000 purchased new now.
tesla has optomized the power to peak around 75 mph.
for all four wheels the suspension is only independent.
i have driven one car that was horrendous to drive in slippery road.
seems to me i have to win the lottery to drive on of these....whateverdavid e. manwell 8:15am | aug 13, 2009 imagine an electric car freed of heavy, space-consuming mechanical components which only gasoline cars need, such as: clutches (including engine-to-wheels fluid couplings, i.e. ”automatic” transmissions), drive shafts, or differentials.
in terms of business model we could assume that all the battery packs are the property of some big business company.
the volt is laughable at best, and this blog provides the data to make even the most rigorous skeptic a believer...
the range vs speed chart is dramatically improved, with a range of 277 to 320 miles driving at 70mph to 65mph, respectively.
can you imagine scientists that are to stupid to think.
by the way, i am in anchorage alaska.
you don't get far in 20 minutes driving that style.
the model s is bigger in every way compared to the roadster, so the abs brakes and traction control systems would have to be, at the very least, recalibrated and run through the full round of testing.
that one is power used that just can't be removed by improving efficiency.
spin that windmill blade with your hand to get initial boost to electric engine and see yourself how far your car goes.
that's 4 hours each way with a little to spare.
tesla is (i think) going to make a big jump with the model s but the typical family is always on about range, range, range.
the ideal energy source would contain characteristics of both batteries and caps: energy density of a battery, life span of a capacitor, ability to be repeatedly and quickly charged like a capacitor.
you'd be using more electricity to generate less.
teg 5:29pm | mrt 26, 2009 bravo to everyone who worked on model s - it looks spectacular.
fyi - now we just found out that there is a direct link between the demise of bees and wide spread of cellular signals - i bet people saw that coming when they started using cell phones.
timo 11:37am | dec 29, 2008 patrick, generating hydrogen requires enormous amount of electricity,about factor of two more than what battery electric vehicles would use.
not that it would be feasible currently for price, safety or energy cost, i'm just curious.
you will get used to certain algorithms of movement.
i assume that if the model s gets a much superior technologhy battery, that this will also be retro-fitted to new roadsters.
it still needs no differential, transmission, or front-to-rear drive shaft.
about electric race-cars they do exist, one used about 6000 cells wired in panels that could be quickly yanked out and replaced.
second, it would devastate the oil industry (not that anyone i know would care) and might have adverse effect on stock markets.
wouldn't the inability to risk long trips, due to a lengthy recharge required only partly through a 500 mile daily drive be likely to turn people off?roy 6:34pm | dec 21, 2009 david, while it is true that higher acceleration requires more amps, the higher amperage is for a shorter time.
just a side note if anyone at tesla is interested: i also have a concept for a true "positively driven" ivt (infinitely variable transmission) that i thought of prior to the ast concept when i was still thinking in terms of gears (ratios).
i'd like to see video clips of their traction control tests like they have for the roadster.
also, because of the low energy density, the cost per kwh stored would be much higher.
now you only need to loop that and you get perpetual machine that gives out 5w power.
reducing top speed has a bigger effect on range due to aerodynamic drag, but the model s wouldn't sell if it was limited to a maximum speed of 50 mphdavid e. manwell 2:27pm | dec 21, 2009 roy: electric drive is wonderful, but high acceleration still takes more work than lower levels of it.
the gears never touch each other.
electricity is even much less expensive at night, because the companies want to keep their equipment running.
not at all useful at nights, early morning and late evening, cloudy day or shadow of trees/buildings.
this configuration gives better than 3 cop coefficiency of performance when the outside ambient is above 38 degreesf.. the double fuse per cell is over kill on a liquid cooled batt pack.
it also helps to keep the tesla highly independent of petroleum based products, and fuel could be obtained at any supermarket.
as well, it seems significant advances in magnetic and bonding materials, not to speak of dc to ac control systems may have opened the door to use of this technology for transportation purposes.
after a while, you'll need more charging stations or ones that can support several cars at once.
and that doesn't count necessary air caps between units.
:-)brian covault 7:01pm | aug 6, 2009 timo, then again there are messages in the blog speculating on future infrastructure in or above roadways to allow charging on demand as you drive which tells me at least some people would prefer not to stop and charge at all.
there is no room for sarcastic adlibs, and commentary, in any serious negotiation or decision making process.
this also means that type s assumed 300 mile range with 85kwh pack could actually be larger than that in steady highway speed.
all it would take is just a little bit of everyone's time to get this done.
comparing worst case electric case with 40 % overall efficiensy we get 240 g of co2 per 1 mj of wheels energy versus about the same mass of co2 of regular gasoline car per same wheels energy.
no household connection to grid can handle that, so how has it been made?
i do not believe any of these battery options are "old technology".
only practical way to radically increase range is to get higher energy density cheap energy storage system.
that is a very old idea, darn near every schoolboy thinks of that when they first learn of motors and generators.
governments are at last seeing the light and creating an environment where the gas guzzlers are taxed out of existence.
high end cells like http://industrial.panasonic.com/www-cgi/jvcr13pz.cgi?e+ba+3+aca4001+ncr1... are 2.9ah.
timo 11:21pm | mei 11, 2009 apparently mathematical part of my brain is on vacation.
but it is worse than that, no motor or alternator is perfect, there is always some friction and electrical resistance wasting a small amount of power as heat.
car batteries cost something like five times as much as stationary cheap battery where battery to battery charging could be made.
make these beautiful cars go further (without charge) and you will have a winner.
your astm isn't just keeping torque it is mystically generating energy from nowhere.
may be even more economical.
in extreme cold steering will stiffen, brakes will be stiff and slower to respond and the battery will consume energy keeping itself regulated.
not for sale yet but like the tesla roadster it is a very cool car!
fukushima, could you post link to english page, please.
even bright backlight of ordinary speedometer gets annoying when you are driving in dark roads, not to mention something that is many times bigger and needs backlight to show you what you are doing.
electrical power generation from natural gas is relatively clean other than the co2.
if i can get that i will have sufficient range to do all but my longest trips without recharging (i don't see charging stations in algonquin park or the gov't dock near my relative's cottage appearing any time soon).
their technical specs on the batteries are thus: cell type cylindrical type 18650 size diameter 18mm, height 65mm capacity (0.2ita)
you can't get much smaller than roadster for frontal area but you might be able to lower the drag coefficient quite a bit.
i do have an idea if usable have you though about scaveging what from the moter and using it to help heat the car.
not with single tech, but with multitude of different techs seem to get to same range of capability.
to charge it in five minutes you would need 2040kw connection.
short car with weight in the center means agile car.
so, at best you could get absolutely nothing, but in practice you would end up losing energy.
we had a great conversation, and i think he was surprised that i was aware of tesla.......
brian h: wile the display screen is nice, and like most electronics is reliable, it doesn't control essential functions and the car can operate without it.
also eu people like small cars because of chronic lack of parking space and presence of narrow streets.
perfect city-car and fun in longer trips too (but only for one or max two passengers).
there is another article talking about using high voltage spinel cathode which also mention 100-126+mah/g capacity with 3-4.9 voltage range (300-588wh/kg depending of how much current we draw out of it) for full batteries with over 95% capacity retention over 50 cycles.
they are grand masters of marketing.
2400v @ 1000a. roadster uses internally something like 500a connections between engine and battery (375v connection to 185kw engine).timo 12:09pm | aug 6, 2009 xcraft: hyperion’s g3 vx line batteries are not especially high energy density batteries.
that is the source of the power output.
my underframe has a major center-sill, to which are attached light lateral members extending to light side-rails, which hold the body.
it is interesting to see what can be done if you optimize for an all electric vehicle as is the case of the roadster.
i live in london and i feel that it would sell well here.
a power plant capable of pulling large tractor-trailers.
i did get an email from gm's supervisor of plant engineering dept(romulus engine operations), oscar sosa in response to a blog i put on gm's "voltage" blogs" about my astm concept and he said he was interested in finding out more about it
i have little concerns about the technical aspects since most manufacturers come with great technical capacities and features to new products.
it doesn't make sense to remove the engine but leave the cooling system and fuel tanks in the car - you would have to disconnect fuel lines and coolant lines (unless air cooled), with the potential of spills and leaks, and as you pointed out, they are small, so why not keep them together as one unit.
of course that wolf e2 is quite a bit lighter than roadster (because of those batteries) so it probably is also more efficient, which in turn means that range calculation i used needs some correcting factor.
your transmission idea would be good for very fast speeds (rpms) where emotor torque starts to decline, but for roadster-type torque range it doesn't matter much.
there are some on the market rated with more ah but do so by discharging to a lower voltage.
toshiba may be trying to flog these batteries to auto companies but no one is buying because they are much lower energy density.
from pictures it doesn't look even as slippery as roadster, too many sharp angles and scoops and stuff.
metals seem much more likely to break, and any lubricants you have significantly start to change their characteristics, along with coolants and refrigerants.
for rear wheels roadster already does that, and i believe type s in 4wd
energy loss distribution: to understand why these curves have the shapes that they do it is helpful to examine where the energy actually goes.
other than some people might try and run a long extension cord to the charger and burn the unit up.
getting different ev companies to choose same battery design would prove to be impossibility.
a tesla pack has a heater to keep the packs warm.
i have a couple of good ideas that would basically make so much energy, you might be able to have a surplus.
this probably looks more intuitive since it is always increasing as speed increases.
assuming a 4 wheeled vehicle, that would allow both non-leading wheels to track directly behind the wheel ahead, giving each the same turning radius.
the fisker karma is going to offer solar cells on the car as an option.
so he's blowing smoke thru his hat out his posterior orifice.
if you have ever ridden a 10 speed bicycle down the feather river canyon in the sierra's, you are shocked that you can go almost all the way by coasting.
the bottom line is that producing mechanical energy from electricity will always (for the distant foreseeable future) entail a high cost battery from cutting edge technology.
this will have an effect on distance travelled as any kinetic energy is tranferred to the battery with associated losses.
and there is no evidence that even radio-frequency (except microwave) em radiation could cause any cellular changes unless it is extremely intense.
just ordinary emotor runs about 95+ efficiency, which is about best efficiency percent that humans have ever made in any energy conversions.
if the power system in the roadster is anything like the battery power systems i have worked on in the past, then it is not possible to discharge the batteries (driving, using electronics, etc) and charge them at the same time.
i live and work in areas that are mountainous, so roads can be slippery and cars can start to slide regardless of how slow you drive.
if you are going on a long trip you can pick up a tow-able.
also, tesla motors did do a run up to lake tahoe in the nearby sierra nevada mountains, climbing up through donner pass.
power 3--extended range...sunday driving---30-60 mph smooth terrain.
payment could be automated, a club method or credit card deductible etc.
if an alternator was connected to the driveshaft, the drive motor would have to work harder to mechanically power the alternator and the motor would require more electrical power, thus draining the batteries faster.
and you can start every day with full charge.
when integrated with an electric motor as one unit i call it an astm (all speed transmission motor).
the result is that tesla and gm are using radically different approaches for plug-in cars, and that requires different batteries."
even if it could give only one kw of power you could get few miles out of it during a day.
fortum in here has already build some chargers in sweden and finland and there is some kind of europe-wide standardization going on for high-voltage chargers.
bev is cheaper, but not that much cheaper.
suspension, tires, wear and tear are still same, there is no miracle tech to remove those.
i can understand the accumulation of kinetic energy depending on how much mass is involved which would mean how long it would take the rockets constant 10 ft. lb. torque to get the system to 1000 rpms, however, what momentum(kinetic energy) you would have at 1000 rpms only comes into play when you are trying increase or decrease the systems rpms.
the tesla proves electric autos are not dull and boring.
the tesla is rated at 244 miles but practical range is about 190 so for this factor, 800 -> 622 miles.
so they try to improve transmissions with cvts, ivts, better aerodynamics, increase engine efficiency(electric motors) and then say, "the only way we can get more range out of our vehicles is to carry more fuel (bigger or better batteries) , but just like the breakthrough for "constant thrust" there is a breakthrough for "constant torque".
'if we can get just to the 600 mile range while the electric car is still a niche market, beyond 500 miles, many people would just fly anyway.
g = 151wh/kg so no revolutionary batteries there.
it has a 1 l. 3-cylinder engine "range extender".
what is the different characteristics required of a battery in a gas electric verses an all electric other than smaller kwh storage for gas electric.
for first 0-300mph you would need to limit power output in order to prevent tire burning, so it could last longer than just calculating 67kwh/22.5mw.
i need a bit more practicality, slightly bigger ground clearance etc.
you need energy storage in some form, energy is not free.
the reev (range extended electric vehicle) like the volt and the pml mini http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/08/the_hybrid_mini.php offer a viable alternative to the ev for reducing dependence on foreign oil without the “absolute range limitations”.
.the painterman-claus heuer to all "mystical range improvement device" - suggestions: you can figure out your range simply by measuring losses at any given speed and divide your power supply with that figure.
this solution will allow a person to drive an electric vehicle across the nation without having to stop and recharge the battery pack or switch over to a gas powered generator.
i assume tesla are aware of such concerns, and are using a frequency that is not detrimental to human health.
i would just need to drive slowly to get to my destination.
once i get on the autobahn, i ll have it do a constant 110 kph (quite slow for german average, i d say).
by doing so, i can not only improve my study related in my majors but also approach to my dream.
see the white paper about batterieshttp://www.teslamotors.com/blog4/?p=59 two fuses does seem extravagant, but they are different types and one comes built into the battery.
that would be perfect platform for lightweight city ev.
you would simply be turning some of the mechanicle power of the car into electricity.
the dollie would then continue on by itself to the next exit in need of dollies at the next freeway on ramp automatically, leaving you and your ev on battery power to proceed where you will.
using any rotating part as a generator will produce a drag, proportional to the electrical energy producedm slowing it down.
is there anyway that you can make it go faster than that.
you can expect about a +/- 10wh/mile variation with a +/- 20% variation in tire pressure.
in practice you would get way less than that.
i believe that i would be able to prove how you can regenerate your own electrical powere without the use of plug ins.
this is just the range data divided by mph: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3231/3121261608_ce97d37f5d_o.jpg slightly zoomed in: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3095/3120433823_f87a1ffa40_o.jpg about clarkson's 55 miles, i'm not defending him, but these graphs are from steady-speed data points.
think of all the taxis in the u.s. having no emissions.
the gear ratio is meant to blast the roadster out of the gate to hit 60mph, without blowing the transmission up---(2 gear old tranny).
ordinary phev has emotor in parallel of ice and when you need more power they both are used to transfer energy to tires.
it would still be a selling point.
in other words, regardless of, and independent of, the wheels rotational speed (rpm) as in the "rocket's thrust" example.
roadster with hard top.
with future techs you get easily 400-500 hundred mile worth lifetime (battery pack size increases which means range increases for single cycle _and_ cycle capability improves).timo 12:27pm | aug 28, 2009 jeremy lansman, so you awd (all wheel drive) is not for safety but for rough terrain.
it can only change forms.
it could be useful for having at work to charge 1 or 2 tesla's during the daytime.
they look vary promisingroy 4:48pm | mei 22, 2009 all this talk about charge stations needing to store power is just not reasonable.
it's also why gasoline cars have to refuel.
ordinary cables would melt in milliseconds with that amount of current.
they generate some, but to keep things simple, i'd prefer reliable and cheap ordinary shocks.
if it is very new, then maybe it just isn't translated yet.
i can see that if obama accomplishes this, re-election would be a surety.
one with slightly higher energy density (bmod0058 e015 b1) has energy density of 2.67wh/kg and weight 680g. that has price of $247 / unit.
of course the vehicle i drove most didn't have wheels but tracks.
if the screen fails, e.g., the car is unusable.
this would give you great range and make re-charge time meaningless.
existing cruise control devises can be put in place on your downward direction to control your speed, as so you don't have to ride the breaks all the time.
would that ever be able to take on battery weight (without losing strength – even compromising some body weight savings for more strength than similarly dimensioned steel body without reaching a steel version’s weight).
the model s will be much heavier, and have worse aerodynamics probably than the roadster, so these numbers are definitely off.
i think 600 mile radius is enough for that.
i bet there are better solutions than that engine that are tuned for generator use only.
that would cost quite a lot, but could be useful to get your car charged "on road".
i also commented that type s is a bit too much "pimp my ride" -car with its 17" touchscreens and stuff.
engineering /elektrisch / roadster / 605 opmerkingen with more than 100 roadsters delivered to customers so far and more on the road each week, it’s natural for some customers to run “experiments” on them.
one idea that could be implemented on the hard top version would be a flexible solar cell lamination, also on the drive train cover, at least the trial to find out how much more range it might bring on sunny days might be worth to spend the effort to implement it.
if you charge system is 95% efficient you are heating things up at 107kw power.
as far as i know small superconductive coil can hold a huge amount of electricity.
another nice point we can mention, in an other part, is the heat pump installed by audi on the e-tron instead of a classic cooling system.
in the configuration above, 1% equals about 30 lbs.
for fri-su that is two 10 hour nights and five hours daytime from fri and sa.
also earth gets a lot more than 10gw / day form sun.
the downs are that it may not be graceful to think about a model s towing a battery behind it.
based on the video they demonstrate that mode of operation is the only thing they care.
200a 1000v makes that same thing but cable needs twice the copper.
softtop is quite nice).
no headlights or cabin air blower (large 12v loads)
while you are discussing range, duration, power, effectiveness of the tesla car on a high technical level,i would be interested in just everyday consumer experiences, although the roadster is not comparable to an avarage family car.
for $85 000 you can buy huge of battery-based storage unit.
of course then we have slight problem with 60kwh.
maybe the technology of transparent solar panels for windows is already advanced enough as well and could even replace all windows with solar technology, which can be added as a film, like window tinting.
you guys have made my dreams & others become a reallity.
weight is also not a issue here, transmission + shafts don’t weight much."
i believe any roadside restaurant can charge cars with several kw connection (just 380v three phase @ 100a would be 38kw which would charge 300 mile worth in about two and a half hour).
that an ev can drive faster than 80 mph, or longer than 2 hours!
http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2347873,00.asp if any owners could shed some light on this issue it would be help to hear about tesla's customer service.
it is possible that, when the entire energy generation and manufacturing chain is considered, the electric car consumes more oil than a conventional car in the same class, and pollutes more.
the only, pending other developments, constant supply of electricity is hydro and nuclear.; solar and wind are not constant suppliers across the country.
tesla approach is not using actual brakes for regenerative braking, but "engine brake", so if you lift your foot from the gas-pedal you switch on regenerative braking.
if a human body is an electromagnetic field, it for sure would have some level of interaction with the em radiation from the car.
there is no need to run the motor as fast as the wheel as in a direct drive transmission and no gearing up to reach the wheels' speed.
it is debatable whether "fast charging" is better or cheaper than "swapping", swapping is likely to be quicker, fast charging stands would take less space and could be more widely distributed.
the received ' wisdom' they will have taken away from the programme is that cars which store their energy of propulsion in highly compressed explosive are the vehicle of the future whilst tried and tested accumulator storage is a dead end.
energy conversion efficiensy for electricity generation by stationary power plant is at least 50 % for most horrible coal plants and is 60 % in general.
the power would be transfered by a dropdown induction coil or drag unit that would induce energy by the movement of the car from the center cable / or copper grid, to the vehicle for charging as it traveled.
a particular problem for competition here is the lack of in-house expertise.
this will mean that you wont be able to recharge more than 30kw/h or 15kw/30 min.
yes we all know that regenerating power from a power source has been a school boy's fantasy, then again so was this laptop i type from.
no doubt that tesla is trying to address cold-weather issues here, but there certainly is an issue here that can be addressed, and it will be interesting to see how the roadster and other tesla vehicles will behave when they finally do make it up to the north star state.
it is also confirmed by everything humanity observed so far about 13 billion years of universe existence.
for example toyota camry has 28 mpg epa but toyota hybrid has about 40 mpg epa.
unfortunately most fundamental law of physics is law of energy conservation.
this is basically the only reason why hybrid cars has betetr mileage.
better place has just that business model.
(for instance using the port batteries while the starboard batteries are being charged by the small generator, and vice versa.)
there is no "fast charging" for roadster (unless you count that 3.5 hours fast charging).
for fc it isn't that bad because they already are fc/bev hybrids.
this doesn't include any allowance for replacing the battery after 7-10 years.
charging time doesn't really matter if you charge your car duringnnight while you sleep.
using blue-tooth in your laptop in your lap is probably more "harmful" than those are.
realized energy density 50,000mah/g where refferred mass g is not a total weight of the battery but the mass of the definite air anode .
i agre with your calculation but some high efficient photovoltaic thin moduls can reach about 80 w per square meter.
ultracaps are heavy, so if you use them to capture energy you might actually lose range because of increased rolling resistance.
i just read about solar cells with nano antennae that can convert *80%* of the sunlight to electiricy and it would theoretically even be cheap (can be produced using printing tech like newspapers are made).fukushima 11:26pm | mei 16, 2009 mr. timo
bravo for all the hard work you've done thus far.
they have lousy energy density of about 67wh/kg which is little bit over half of what tesla is using now.
-configuration does that with front wheels as well.
the energy loss to that drag is about twice the energy the wind turbine can produce.
since the power grid derives only 1% of its power from petroleum products the reev greatly reduces consumption of petroleum products.
there are also *huge* capacities mentioned in other techs (up to 2-3kwh/kg), but those are not tested with full battery and are more theoretical than practical.
as for the 3 1/2 hours to fully charge the pack , this is for disneyland world, and not the "i want it now" mentality world of 2009 drivers........
now, with two wheels sharing that duty, both inside-track wheels carrying the same load, and only the outside track's wheels coasting, only half as much torque per wheel is needed, allowing smaller motors.
roy 6:41pm | dec 3, 2009 bill, big car companies can make evs, but they are generally just more interested in making gas cars.
the ramp-up would hold always hold a battery pack or more.
bshumberger 3:50pm | jul 7, 2009 very well, you win.
unfortunately i am still waiting for really solid data on cold-weather behavior.
i am also very excited about all electric cars.
i ignored efficiencies differences thinking they would be a wash.
the control is all in the digital electronics and inverter.
i think the worst affect of the chevy volt ads about getting 230 mpg is the perception that if they would make misleading claims about the perfomance characteriztics, what else will you be unpleasantly surprised with after purchasing one.
geometry of battery pack may be standardized too including mechanical and electrical sockets.
us is notorious about that there people use cars to get everywhere, even very short distances.
5) bio-diesel ruin environment and lower biodiversity in areas where it is produced.
you will need 3 to 5 battery packs so that while one of them is in the car others are under charging.
tesla's challenge is to persuasively nudge those habits into more efficient modes for us.
i rather like the design of the roadster (except with the hardtop, in that part you are quite correct.
i have read that it has 54kwh capacity now.
make the recharge connection compatable with existing tech such as sumething as simple as a 440 plug for your home if you do not have that now .
so with all accessories running at full power you would be using about 17-19 kw /h instead.
speed curve, which is equivalent to vehicle efficiency vs. speed.
of torque but when the rockets same energy output was at 100 rpms it was still 10 ft. lbs.
it would be interesting to see what the prediction would be comparing the prius with a gas-efficient conventional car in the same weight class.
i beleive we shouldnt be wasting things energy included, i have some bad news for people in that area because things have been changing on this planet long before man got oil and coal out of the ground.
sorry, generators and motors are not 100% efficient, so having your drive motor fighting to accelerate the car against the regenerative brakes would only reduce the range - and make for really lousy performance!
a quick way to swap out battery packs would have service stations selling charged packs for $10 if you left your drained one behind.
but i agree, the 55 mile range is understandable given a "track day".
the fact that they help environment and kill polluting gas guzzlers is just bonus to their attractiveness.
few car buyers will want two specialty cars, each.
power 2--med power ... everyday cruising at 55-80 mph give you good range and still high speed.
tesla would have a good size market if it used its technology to develop such a product.
energy capability of one of those is 101.7wh.
you could make that portable enough for carrying it in type s, but i think that takes too much space for roadster.r4 thanx for the valuable information.
our life has been subsidised by oil for generations -without oil this planet could not sustain the current population.
tesla roadster engine can convert energy at about 200kw power, which, if utilized fully, would cause wheels to lose grip.
john: how much energy it takes to recharge depends on how much was used, charging after a short drive takes much less energy than charging from "fully drained".
an underframe designed around a center-sill, leading, through several side bolsters, to lighter body-supporting side-members (like a railroad car's frame) could support the concept.
it's not magic, or windmills on the roof stuff.
at least pem is smaller (fox news report), which intuitively would mean better efficiency, weight and thus range.justin smith i may know of a way to increase range!
cheaper models will follow that even treehuggers can afford, but it still is business, not charity.
i think a battery for a car would have to be rated at 800 miles, before a driver would go 600 without anxiety
there is a far superior method of applying available torque to a system that is rotating at a much higher rpm and i call it an ast (all speed transmission).
a car powered by batteries and an electric motor has a "plug to wheel" efficiency of about 76%, making bevs 5x more efficient than gassers.
calvin jones; yes you are right, you get a bigger range with solar panel roof...about 1% bigger range for very good case.
with that kind of range they wouldn't even notice that it takes time to recharge car (or at least 99% of people wouldn't).
however the motor remains connected to the transmission.
since, the graph shows an air resistance as the biggest enemy to ev's durability i would like you to think little bite how to reduce it.
you don't need to find a gas station, just drive up to a hotel, restaraunt, even someone's house and ask if you can plug in for an hour or so!
aerodynamic losses especially are my interest.
people could probably get used to charging if they could try it before they buy it.
about 46% of the petroleum goes into gasoline after refining.
to protect users from potentially lethal shock, on the above, permantly connected, retractable charging cord, a diode be connected between the car’s recharger and the tracton battery, which restricting current flow to an inward direction only.
so that should be 7142 * 3.6 * 2.9 = 74.5kwh which is about 38% better.
i just said that to show that the design was strong enough to handle full braking(locked-up wheels at speed).
with online and offline batteries and multiple recharging technologies and computer controlled continuous recharge technology the electric car coold go 10,000 miles at 80 miles an hour without stopping.
the ice motor can also run at a single rpm for optimum performance while generating electricity.
there isn't enough sunlight even in the desert at noon hitting the paint to power the car.
even 50 kw/h in 10 mins is so hard to do, imagine bigger battery packs (when new batteries are developed).
for comparison energy efficiensy of regular gasoline car engine is 20 % worst case and less than 30 % average.
if we assume 50kg for casing we have 400kg for battery: 400kg*232wh/kg = 92.8kwh battery pack.
of course 200kwh is slightly overkill.
the faster it goes, the more energy it gains.
i only wish telsa great success.
and i don't have space or time to tinker with that sort of things right now but my vision was to build tiny cheap runabout, maybe based on atv: something like this:http://www.ecoeatv.com/products/e-force-atv/ but less off-road (smaller and less friction tires for example) and more like a car to make grocery shopping.
top gear bbc1 did an electric car special with the tesla and and honda fcx hydrogen car.
gm's answer to a "clean" car is an undersized, underpowered, underwhelming ev called the "volt", unable to operate effectively at highway speeds with a range of 40 miles.
i don't believe that people would complain about "slow charging" with 2000 mile range.
nuclear, hydro, wind, geothermal and solar are all clean sources of electricity.
the result is, adding an alternator the way you propose would actually waste power and energy, reducing driving range and performance.
its power train can still be all-electric, with only one control system for all 4 motors together.
the back is fairly ok but could do with some remodeling too.
however, the burden of proof is on the engineers, manufacturers, electric power companies and battery recyclers, that electric cars will significantly reduce greenhouse gasses globally.
tesla have a lot of advance looking the other manufacturer.
so batteries definitely can be used for boats.
this would be less efficient than the standard arrangement as there are energy losses in charging and discharging the battery.
it would be better just to put better batteries in car.
i think the wind idea is better because you divert energy from the force of air against the front of the car and direct it downward through the squirel cage, and out below the vehicle.
maybe part of that can be in the advancment of solar cell technology or generators around the rear axles that could provide charging while driving...
btw nanotech is again showing interesting development in this field as well as batteries.
thank you..gc submitted 05-04-09timo 1:48am | mei 5, 2009 ronald wose, what you describe is basically regenerative braking which tesla already has.
i can't believe i'm pissing away such a good idea on a blog, and if tesla doesn't do it in a few years i will.
i would like to hear from someone who already knows motors and is working/thinking about this.
materials of such batteries are not consumed by its aging.
heat rises draw the heat off the top of the battery is one suggestion .
another way you could do it, is to hook it to a wheel using a small drive shaft that would spin the alternator.
best voltage for car would be its battery pack native voltage + some for charging so that onboard pem can handle that voltage.
just ordinary regen braking is quite enough.
can't say that i follow it that well myself, but looks like nano-scale inductors can efficiently store and return large amounts of electricity.
anyway, absolute limit is set by car-side of the batteries, not charger side.
tesla roadster has a charger compatible with regular residential electricity sockets.
one concern about the model s, though: i hope that tesla is sharp enough not to just put the exact same system into the model s without the same battery (ooh, bad pun) of tests.
the torque available is the torque applied regardless of the wheel's rotational speed (rpm).
capacitors do not have internal resistance and are there for more efficient.
i really hope your predictions about 400wh/kg or more in a couple of years pan out, especially if the price where brought down to 1$/kwh or something.
540 miles is close to breakpoint, but it would be better if you wouldn't need to charge at all before 600 miles.
tesla motors has already figured out how to switch the motor to be a generator, the car does that only when the driver wants to slow down.
i've thought of a weakness it has: to move the car through the inside of curves/corners, only one wheel powers the car.
80% out of 85kwh in 1.5 hours needs 45kw connection.
you also make funny claim that renewable energy sources might not be enough for bev:s. that is just plain silly.
the prime idea and genius of tesla`s electromotors is the simplicity, one rotor one stator and miracle, energy, my idea is to make a rotor of almost every moving part on the car ex. tires and transmission that until now had only a passive (spending) role.
there are few materials that are superconductive in liquid nitrogen (boiling point 77k) which isn't very hard thing to obtain.
eemc is developing a standardized blueprint for converting every type of vehicle to the efficiency of all electric operation with the convenience of never having to wait while recharging.
in car that manifests itself in increased kinetic energy of the car itself.
both type s and roadster utilize touch-screens for multitude of functions (including typing pin-code to start it).
updates for type s progression would be nice.
similarly, by reducing vehicle mass you see a proportional reduction in rolling loss.
also you need to consider that these "charging stations" will not really be "charging stations" because it just isn't profitable.
in case if topgear raced with acceleration/deseleration between 60 mph and 120 mph every about 300 meters (5 to 6 times per mile) based on 50% regeneration efficiensy and steady state range close to 110 miles (102 mph) resulted range would be close to 55 miles.
efficiency increase is, of course, welcome, but it just wouldn't increase range much because current systems are already quite energy efficient.
i'm not sure it would be a good idea to use it for regular braking, as locking up the wheels would trigger a skid.
that is not too much, i bet any pizzeria with electric ovens has that kind connection to grid.
edmund, it is possible to use thin film solar panels in car, but energy gain from those is minimal and cost is high.
by reducing our usage of petroleum to 40% of our current use allows us to only use our domestic petroleum production eliminating oil imports.
3-4 cells carry rather limited juice that never could damage adjacent tubes/cell packs shorts in the dc-dc powers/diodes is the only real issue i see with the battery system which would blow out the fuse for a whole module, hopefully that can be replaced easy ?
most evs and hybrids can use the motor as a generator to partially recharge the batteries, but the electrodynamic drag it produces slows the car down - it is called "regenerative braking".
even a direct crosswind will slightly increase forward moving aerodynamic losses due to its interaction with the body shape.
from what i have read li ion batteries have a life span of 5 years or so; capacitors have a life span of 15 years.
answer back brian h: with the increase in battery energy density from nanowire or air-carbon (or other technologies) allows one to use smaller lighter possibly cheaper batteries to get 300miles or even 600 miles per charge.
in my transmission concept(ast) the torque(rotational force) applied to the wheels is independent of the wheel's rotational speed (rpm).
of course you get _something_ from solar panels fitted in the car.
how much energy would you be able to collect back if you max that capability (which roadster doesn't).
of course if you could use that 175kw/kg battery tech for 60mah/g (180wh/kg) batteries, power would not be a problem.
most of this stuff would have to have been known long before the details of the plant could be completed.
with that you should be using approx 185kw power all of time (engine max) which would render car battery empty in roughly 20 minutes.
i'm also not certain what the terms of the swappable battery lease will be, but i presume it would call for free replacment of any battery pack that fails or falls below a certain performance level.
as the cto explains, such efficiencies fall off drastically at low and high speeds because of nonlinear effects, such as parasitic losses, and high order functions of aerodynamics & tire drag.
everybody already has electricity coming in their houses and generating electricity can be done in about billion different ways including in house solar cells.
in near future you can get batteries that give 1000 mile range with reasonable price, but not quite yet.
time will tell, although it looks like there are some people with some deep pockets to get this technology built if the theory holds true when scaled on a commercial basis.
i just read nature article about 60mah/g 400c batteries.
the advantage of this serial concept over the ice direct drive parallel concept is the elimination of gearboxes and dual drive mechanisms.
tesla could be involved in meeting the 60 mpg requirement for vehicles in the next two years.
they are expensive and generally not worth the trouble.
reading these comments and ideas i got one my one, regarding better consumption of accumulated energy.
this would be like peddling a bicycle at 40 miles per hour and every time you peddle you could apply the same torque that you had in 1st gear (by the way that can and will be done but that's another application).
probably the most successful is use of bio diesel in brazil, alcohol in cuba and primitive models of ev buses in india.
the real world has wind, variations in road surface, hills, occasional stops and starts and other conditions.
and if you double it again to 60kw you will accelerate to about 107 mph using 4 times as much power as you did at 60mph, yet you’d only travel about 1.8 times as fast.
i approached ford and chrysler with this idea and the response ( from a technician) suggested that it was not possible.
it made sense given the protection the battery has against thermal runaway for the cells.
the us consumes 390million (per eia) gallons of gasoline a day.
air displacement from car movement, which in other words is air drag.
i guess the whole topgear evaluation was badly focused from the car use model point of view expected for tesla roadster most of the time.
thats the correct way all ev's should orient by my opinion.
the same would be possibly true for finding a charging station right when one needed it.
your second question is for type s. roadster battery pack is charged from empty to full in 3.5 hours.
tesla motors have some arrangement made with solar cityhttp://www.solarcity.com/. check that out.
about my "rocket wheel" analogy where you said, "since the “reaction mass” isn’t accelerated like it is for a rocket, neither wheel motor nor car can maintain constant torque or thrust the way a rocket can.
for everyday local driving it would be more convenient and cheaper to just plug-in to recharge at home or any "park and charge" lot, rather than have to drive out of your way the nearest battery swap station.
thing is that for 600 miles you need to use about 170kwh battery.
consumption would have to be reduced by 50%, which would cost the federal government and state governments hundreds of billions of dollars (a $10 a pack tax on cigarettes would not fly).
i imagine ac magnetic field from emotor is like strobe-light going on and back off in very rapid succession for some homing pigeon.
leoronald wose how about powering the pge grid to a special lane on the freeways, that would transfer electricity by direct contact or induction as the car travels in the lane.
i like your powertrain set up.
i'm hoping that lots of public recharging outlets will be available soon along major highways.
there is an exception, if the wheels are spinning then energy is lost to burning the tires.
and so on and so on... i know all of you are busy doing something else but visit here every now and then would be nice.xavier 2:10am | sep 23, 2009 timo, effectively, peak power is 2700 w/c not kw (misstyped).
although you say weight and efficiency gains would not be significant, i have not found support for your claim that in-wheel motors are weaker and less efficient anywhere on this site.
i imagine situation for those slow charger points is worse in there than it is here in finland.
4wd (awd?) is mandatory for me.
there is chart that says that roadster mileage efficiency is 110wh/km.
after a week of sitting the power range would go (for example) from 176 to 170 or so on a nice week.
i understand that the heating/cooling components will have a variable duty cycle, but it has often been stated that using the seat heaters is "far" more efficient than heating the cabin.
this probably looks more intuitive since it is always increasing as speed increases.
the guys that run the mammoth mountain ski resort are interested in building a very basic overhead umbilical dollie run that can power electric mountain bikes going up their ski runs in the summer months.
(223 lb) so the actual engine is 65kg!!!!!!!!
tesla is correct in stating that the return on investment for solar cells on the car is almost zero.
now, if everyone had electric cars, it would be an interesting exercise to see if the night time power requirements outstrip the daytime.
that would give 300/84 x 135 = 482 miles.
calculating from that you get 1 mile in 48 secs.
or you could use battery to battery charging, but then you couldn't "recharge" quite that fast.
(you probably could get *much* higher top speed with same rpm range without losing incredible acceleration with that concept.
besides the objection you raised to handling, the vibration a hub motor would be subject to would, very likely, not take long to destroy it.
attaching solar cells to the car would add thousands to the cost, but would add less than 5 miles of driving range per day.
timo 3:12pm | apr 27, 2009 lets explain a bit further why windmill in car can't work.
the thing is , how cheap/small they can make such device and how hard is to make it mountable/portable
so, lets get those 2kwh/kg batteries at $1000.
thus, any individual can be an an access point.
the california air resources board has already expressed an interest in checking out the basic subscale system if and when it gets built at mammoth mountain for uphill electric powered mountain bike runs on a designated course.
likewise, the impact of ancillary losses is extremely small at high speeds because the primary propulsion power is very high and these small power draws make a relatively tiny contribution.
very thoughtful and elegant engineering work - you've designed a beautiful product.
joe simone: tesla is currently using a 54 kwh liion battery pack with a cobalt oxide cathode with higher energy density and a lower cost per kwh stored.
gasoline is mainly use for automobile travel.
if you put generators around the axles you could generate some electricity when you accelerate.
ancillary losses are caused by all “other” electrical loads in the vehicle, particularly the 12v cooling blowers and pumps, the 12v radio, internal and external lighting, etc.
you could hire this from tesla when you wanted to go touring and place your roadster into a 4'th mode reev.
and because the astm's low rpm output torque can be applied to the vehicle wheels when at speed(with no gearing up) you will save the energy that is now needed(wasted) just to get the motor up to the wheel's speed even before it can begin to apply torque to the moving wheels.
best regards, jon mooring san diego, ca played around a bit with that excel sheet which you can download here.
so instead of thinking how to make global recharging stations (which is unbeliavably expensive) we better start thinking out of the box and use every idea we have.
there *is* coming way better batteries (one prototype with 540wh/kg already tested last year), so improvements are in horizon.
drivers have little choice about their driving speeds, so this efficiency is fortuitous.
if my idea works i think it will advance electric cars dramatically.
justin smith: tesla engineers are aware of capacitors and their limitations.
now, if both motor and alternator were perfect and 100% efficient, that alternator would produce exactly the same amount of extra power the motor needed, there would be no gain and no benefit at all!
based on that she would save about 12000$ in fuels in five year period.
an all-electric power train, centered on a mechanically independent electric motor for each wheel, would do this.
joshua maxwell 9:48am | mei 22, 2009 i think the battery tech that daimler has that tesla whats to test is the new scib battery from toshiba i read in an article a week ago that i cant find now that toshiba had given some of these batteries to major car makers in the us and europe to test for use in evs.
well, only really rare material is lithium itself, and that is recycleable and there are way more than enough of it for world battery need, also batteries develop so where now you need to use x amount of materials you soon need x/5 amount of material.
since only the wheel is below the suspension, unsprung weight is not increased.
next wednesday is arriving the first tesla roadster for a test in belgium.
you might actually start to *gain* some money after a while, because not all cars charge that much during a day.
thanks for the information.
timo 1:09pm | apr 8, 2009 dave johnson, while it is true that you get quite a acceleration, speed and extremely fast deacceleration dropping roadster from a crane, it isn't quite feasible method of transporting people from place a to place b. care to elaborate what do you mean by "free energy"?rad timo, we currently manufacture 100hp magnetic couplers for diesel generators...mostly to eliminate torsional and harmonic vibrations.
fast charging batteries can be done nearly everywhere with negligible change in current grid infrastructure.
since four-wheeled steering is an already developed concept, would it cost more than four separate control systems-- more than motors with twice the torque?ann 2:33pm | okt 3, 2009 finally a new car projects that is incredibly interesting and stands out!
so likely it would beat gasoline cars in racing even with battery swapping time losses.
compressed air engines might be suitable for short range slow speed vehicles, but a long range "air car" would be mostly air tank!
i hate to mention the prius but, even todays “3rd generation” model sells well with around 10.
you gain no advantage of capacitor fast recharge capability when grid can't deliver you that power.
the air pressure in the tires has a large effect on this rolling resistance, grip and the overall tire loss.
but it could make a good parking brake, though.
i haven't seen "cost of maintenance".
that ewolf looks a bit esoteric, much more than the roadster turned out to be.
those forces see "burns no gas" as an affront.
i believe carb's primary interest in this umbilical dollie system is for powering electric semi-trucks in the two righthand slow lanes on california freeways.
in one of the media pages someone (forgot who) says that model s has 85 kwh battery pack.
so tesla roadster is hardly a good race track car.
we might need some other method of storing energy if we want to use ev:s. fuel cell cars maybe if non-polluting cheap method of generating hydrogen is invented, or ultracapacitors if they ever get near batteries in capacity.
solution: design math that you will put on the floor in the garage, drive car over it (park) and wirelessly transfer energy for battery charging.
here's a good idea to generate more power on the road: http://blog.wired.com/cars/2009/02/students-at-the.html http://www.physorg.com/news153505357.html energy-harvesting shock absorbers.
the power feed cable coming down off the dollie would retract onto a reel on the dollie in the event of an emergency disconnect, be it tension related or signal related.
much better to put the wind turbine on a tower at a windy site where "wind drag" doesn't matter.
of course, storing 10x the energy means feeding in 10x the energy, so the demand for hi-power charging facilities would mushroom.
if daimler is doing this well in inventing new tech, i wonder what other not-dinosaur-infested-companies like vw is doing.
maybe you could get roof with solar panels if you pay enough, but don't expect it to affect much.
my perception of the current issues related to your type of products is the use time is quicker than the charge time.
i too require about 700-800 km range, or charging stations, before i seriously consider getting ev.
defroster data should work for that if the a/c is used to remove moisture from the cabin.
batteries in very close future should give about 1.5-2kwh/kg energy density and power density of over 100kw/kg, maybe over 200kw/kg.
imagine a 4 seater small car, which have only 30kw/h battery pack, but weight 800kg.
it might be that standard "cheapest battery you can find" solution would be better than flywheels, at least for now.
ancillary losses (12v loads, cooling fans and pumps, lights, etc.)
initial car range makes a big difference.
the power grid of this country is not going to get fixed by auto makers nor battery technology matter if you can't charge it.
i was aiming for energy density, not range.
runs quiet yet torque is there.
i thought that easily accessed lithium reserve is very limited, but if you can get it from seawater with just $30/kg, then we have way more than enough lithium for those batteries.
for practicality type s is way better than roadster.
at first, you could run the hose at a high flow, but when you got near the top you'd want to reduce the flow to avoid overfilling and spillage, that last little bit would take the longest.
they might use excess oil for energy generation from well directly, but that does still count in the polluting factor.
this is correct since everything is old.
we should be persuaded that compact cockpit volume, light weight and some discomfort are attendent to more necessary economy.
if that was freeway and there was another bigger car next to that roadster that could cause that tether to hit that car, maybe with catastrophic results.
for that i agree that awd is the way to go.
i write this today because i have had ideas that i can not afford to pursue myself.
heater is (if i recall correctly) 3000w unit, but it wouldn't need to run with full power very long to heat air in small cabine, seat heaters less than 100w and headlights on would consume another less than 100w so you would have reduced range, less than that promised 200 miles, but it should still be sufficient for 125 miles: battery pack is 53kwh battery, so car uses about 53000*60/200 = approx 16kw / h
this will also make it more attractive for homeowners to opt for larger solar systems that would reduce or eliminate the use of commercial electricity in their home.
to our customers, happy driving.
i would guess that with proper voltage modulation and phase control, polyphase, low rpm, pancake shaped permanent magnet motors can result in efficient (>85%) traction motors, even under conditions of near zero rpm and high torque.
for instance the shack skin concepts seems interesting idea.
if you have a sub contractor on the motors, they would love the extra sales generated with the success.
i'm talking free energy storage (really).
sounds promising, otoh i can't find any specifics about their batteries.
the motor on each wheel sounds like it has a lot of advantages.
their cto has built such things before.
for safety sake, it would need to properly vent the engine exhaust, have reliable electrical connections to the car, avoid overheating the fuel tank, and safely contain the fuel in case of an accident.
if you then add to that calculation that electricity can be produced entirely free from fossil fuels then bev pollution isn't even close to traditional gasoline engine.
mark tebbutt 9:25am | mrt 12, 2009 new battery tech to reduced charge times by 18 times with no loss of capacity.
costs will have to drop.
since you are starting relatively freshly, why not use this platform under the entire tesla fleet, so that all models can benefit from its mass-production savings (with fewer components to build separately)?
fuel cell cars need hydrogen distribution network and generatin hydrogen needs a lot of energy.
this ivt is a breakthrough concept and when i get a number of companies seriously interested i plan on obtaining a provisional application for patents on them (only takes a couple weeks) and then show them to the most promising company.
hey---remember all the "slop" you have with a "normal" car's shifts---depress the clutch, drop rpms, clutch---throwout bearing--flywheel---shift the gear--let out the clutch--all this is "easy" on a transmission.
jube: tesla motors winter tested their roadster in sweden, and it performed very well on ice, even when very cold.
please follow this up tesla, because it would be a huge selling point.
again it is logical for them to think there can be no improvement in that area because directly driven electric motors are very efficient through their entire working range and any tweaking in efficiency can be done by the use of a cvt (continuously variable transmission).
that would also mean that there might be some high speed treshold where type s has actually more range than roadster (rolling resistances stay relatively constant, while air resistance is exponential).
you can't just call aaa for a tank of gas.
also, i have read about worries that lithium might run out if electric vehicles become popular.
that explains lack of electric cars mass scale presence so far.
you would just get some significant driving distance increase but far from unlimited.
energy flows from high potential source to low potential sink.
if you have some university access sciencedirect journal of power sources is great place to read what is happenng in battery tech.
half that (15kw = 380v @ 40a: no problem for charging) and you can drive nearly four days with no need to fast charge your car.
the graph shows clearly why the top gear presenter only gets 55 miles or so that seems to match pretty good with the hard accelleration and max constant speed which will surely burn tons of juice.
even if we eliminate all drivetrain losses you would still have air resistance, rolling and ancillary losses, and with roadster at 80 mph you would still use about 250wh/mile which translates to about 220 mile range.
that is 500 times capacity of current batteries.
the li-tec battery is a lithium-polymer design similar to volt's.
roadster uses 15kw at 60mph, so you would give it less than 10% increase in expense of high price paint job.
wayne p. bishop 7:21am | aug 11, 2009 cm, as far as my ivt concept goes, i do not have a prototype but the principle or method is pretty straight forward and anyone(engineer) that looked at it could see how it would work.
energy has no free lunch.
sorry, no way around that, it applies to any sort of mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic or electrical transmission design.
as for me specially i need car only for long-distance driving, and then average speed is closer to 50mph than 40mph.
in fact i believe it to be anything but practical.
i guess it could be solved although would be a challenge.
since 1 watt is also just 1 joule/second you can easily convert wh into joules by multiplying by (60 [seconds])*(60 [minutes]).
however, it is puzzling why the ev concepts never get life in japan, eu or even israel (even these countries have more reasons for ev development than we are, at still all aspiration to do so were immediately stopped in begging of development).
for some reason i enjoy that even that i know it is futile and pointless.
it is far easier to work on plant smokestacks and burners.
roadsters and model ses will end up so light that they'll blow off the road in a stiff breeze!
this is proportional to speed due to spinning losses in the gearbox and motor and also proportional to power output due to conversion losses in the various subsystems.
as for the car side of the high power charge the power systems designers could look in the a second recharge power loop to handle high power recharge applications.
what happens between those doesn't count because you use that mostly at home at night and in longer road trips when you are taking a break anyway.
cost of batteries is the only remaining big issue.
if these people selling it are so into beleiving it they wouldnt be (jet setting) all over the planet and using more energy then the average person does ( pretty (hypocratic) in my opinion) .
what i am trying to say is that we need oil but lets give other technologies the investment that has been given to the i.c.e( internal combustion engined ) car manufacturers.
mika asked me have i already ordered my car, and commented about our weird car taxes and our leading status as ev manufacturer (sarcastic comment).
no warning of slide, one second you were driving nicely and next you were driving backwards or spinning uncontrollably.
also, if you want a test site, we are retired and will volenteer to ues your car and drive all over minnesota and test it out.
you then subscribe to their service.
no more pollution there, less would be my guess.
from experience a can say that europeans are concerned for environment more than americans.
with 540wh/kg prototype battery already tested in labs, that would make 600 miles (in type s size car of 200kwh) roughly 370kg battery.
by the way, last year , toyota announced that they will develop metal air rechargeable battery as a battey to be adopted in future toyota car.
that would manage i guess ~15 min of racing with average ~120 kw and speed between 100 to 200 mph.
driving into the wind for 1 mile and then turning around to drive downwind for the same 1 mile (all at the same speed) will use more energy than driving the same speed with no wind over 2 miles.
all owners will be glad to simply drive out of “hopelessly” miring snowbanks, or mud.
much of that is due to copy-catting styling cues, as opposed to aerodynamic optimization, but aerodynamic optimization is, bar far, the most style limiting parameter, which is driven by efficiency / mileage targets.
and because there are no 100% efficient generators/gears/wires etc.
you seem to be offering as absolute fact that the electric pollutes far less than the conventional car.
brian h 12:31am | jun 9, 2009 joe; with either the air-carbon or nanowire silicon anodes, and perhaps this lithium-manganese cathode [ http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl8024328 ] it will be possible to get a very potent battery indeed!
can't think what an earth that person that made this law had been smoking.
the future is electric cars, yes we can.
you can do that same for batteries or flywheels.
awd would be useful only for getting somewhere in deep snow.
i could only assume that investors were wanting a very quick turn around from investment time to production time.
so, between the higher efficiency of generation, the higher efficiency of the electrical grid (compared to truck and railroad shipped gasoline) and the much higher efficiency of bevs mean that the electric option is still cleaner than gassers even when powered by coal, and the increasing use of renewables will make bevs ever cleaner.
by placing in-wheel motors you get rid of both extra weight and gear mechanical transmission power loss, thus increasing efficiency.
like cup holders in the car or the passenger seats could be the lithium polymer batteries.
http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/research/4252623.html tesla power system conversion for 1960 mga i have a 1960 mga that is begging for an electric conversion.
roadster uses only about 15kw in highway speeds (much more in accelerations)
38% increase in to roadster range is 336.72 miles.
if you open a factory here, you will drastically reduce your costs, allowing for a broader consumer range.
this could be an extremely efficient engine (or gas turbine).
thanks for published graphs, its absolute clean way of advertisment.
that would be very fun concept for next project after model s. a motorcycle-car -something.
there would be some loss in range due to cold weather, mostly due to the requirement to heat the car and not because of efficiency loss in the battery itself.
likewise, the impact of ancillary losses is extremely small at high speeds because the primary propulsion power is very high and these small power draws make a relatively tiny contribution.
90kg total would be 6kg of packaging and battery management electronics.
unless a competitor can get hold of a much better proprietary (to him) gadget, he has no particular advantage.
those show 100000mile useful life.
model s reveal is expected to be live streamed march 26th at 12:30pm here: http://www.leftlanenews.com/tesla-model-s-live.html fukushima: unfortunately i don't understand japanese, and could not find the article listed in the english section.
lab testing or even simulated road testing does not represent the real world of driving the ev, until the batteries fail to deliver the published 300 mpc or the 240 mpc.
all over a cleaner world while oil be dedicated to nobler causes like fertilizers and other necesary products!
steven zimmerman: unless your electrical rates are excessively high or low, an ev would use about 2 to 3 cents of electricity per mile.
dear mr. straubel: thank you thank you for providing real, actionable graphs showing real world performance of the tesla roadster.
(like that power/torque curve chart) giving "fuzzy" data is not so bad, but giving out plain wrong information is bad.
also, the lithium-titanate battery would drastically speed up the re-charge process.
tesla could even build them.
if you receive an apology from them will you please publish it on the website.
generating electricity **might** burn oil, and manufacturing some parts might, but car itself doesn't.
i do, but halibut that's boring.
this would be great in combination with a power source like solar since less weight means less power loss.
even if the capacitors with regulators are not purchased from overstock they could be manufactured since the tech is there.
a cvt would add unnecessary weight and cost.
what comes to "manufacturing process" pollution, ev engine is less complex and batteries can be recycled.
you cant have such cable recharging your car, not to mention voltages and amperage needed to achieve that and it will not be safe.
you might lose something like 20% of max range in worst case.
this would allow evs to easily traverse the usa.
sciencedirect journal of power sources.
improvements in efficiency are always welcome, but in machine that already has nearly lossless system any improvement in efficiency wont generate much more range.
roy, 900 kg is directly from ewolf website.
this will allow stations to have a longer life of service between replacement time.
it is possible within the laws of physics as seen in the rocket example and if it is "possible" it can be done but only if one can imagine how.
the only item that will change significantly is the drivetrain power consumption.
as you can see we can't increase rpm without increasing p unless we also decrease t.
further, has it been proven that enough hydroelectric dams, windmills, nuclear power plants, and other sources of "renewable energy", will ever satisfy demand for electricity to power the new world of electric cars?
i live in toronto canada and a car like this will need to perform well in the cold.
in california, 60% is generated by natural gas, which contributes to atmospheric carbon dioxide at a higher rate than coal.
it just feels like towing a car with brakes on, but some powerful truck wouldn't notice roadster behind it.
if threatened, they might try to tear apart such a statement, and could easily do so.
they are pretty efficient, in fact they are 99.9% efficient in transmitting power, that is 22% more efficient than gears.
you could using cameras and screens instead obviously this would be matched by a small electrical cost.
when the battery technology becomes economically feasible, toyota, and honda will beat your pants off!bl hayes 12:54pm | jan 12, 2010 electric cars are nice however if they are to be truly affordable and feasible, then our electric power suppliers must be upgraded to handle the new load and the electric users in this country must convert to hyper efficiencies.
however, solar panels might be able to provide parallel current, thus reducing the energy demand from the batteries and effectively increasing range.
you want to charge it from home where you have a regular 220v 35a limit.
iow this behavior you suggest is automatic in tesla configuration.
you have only 24 hours a day, so i would be looking for nights sleep at that time.
in fact i've never gotten more than 45 mpg. the vw golf gets 38 mpg, not too far behind.
oh, and the top speed is limited by the maximum rpm of the motor, but is electronically limited under that (around 80-90% iirc) to prevent issues of wear on the motor and drivetrain.twojarandka nice to see so good informations.
david noland 9:49am | jul 31, 2009 i got a chance to test-drive a roadster recently, and was very impressed.
some italian designer removed all screen wipers and used a glass that is repelling water so the water just slides during raining.
if we estimate that you go to change oils, spark plugs etc.
batteries also are developing fast.
american's would dominate the world in automotive manufacturing, thousands would go back to work and we would end our oil dependency and over usage.
alan, that 206 wh/mi should give you 250+ mile range at highway speeds (assuming 52kwh battery).
also weaker as in breaks more easily.
that means you need about 850 of those to get one type s 85kwh 300 mile battery charged.
it is like reading a script of new star trek movie where "particle of a day saves the day".
but the model s seems to become a very useful car, it is affordabe (for european standards) and nevertheless the design is stunning!
this is the electricity that is being produced regardless of demand when most people are asleep.
mike gillette: currently, superconductivity require ultracold temperatures below -182 c or -297 f, that requires specialized cryogenic refrigeration.
measured energy losses using whatever drivetrain prototypes use (i assume it is same as roadster).
the only risk of low frequency electromagnetic radiation is if the intensity is sufficient to cause heating it can cause burns.
the electric car is limited by how far it can go on a charge.
that should reduce customer base in about 90% of current gas station customers.
but it is better to refill at a gas station rather than call a tow truck.
the 2 seaters will also greatly help with the parking problem all europe and i am sure all the world is suffering.
consider reality!timo 10:37am | mei 30, 2009 barry a. simkins; i agree that tesla is tailor-made for average us citizen, but i don't think that low speed estimate applies to all of us.
to cruise at 60 mph takes about 15kw. however, if you double that to 30kw you will only accelerate to about 80mph -- far less than twice as fast.
roadster does actually have quite a bit drag coefficient, it is far from perfect for that.
it would kind of be like taking and exchanging your empty propane tank for a full tank, you pay more than having yours refilled but it saves time.
the tesla strategy is to not be dumping the money into the battery technology.
jerry psimer: the cost of solar cells is high, and the power produced is low, especially if shaded or angled away from the sun.
lifepo4 - silicon battery would be consisted from lithium (relatively rare, but more than enough is around, as it can be recycled and doesn't disappear anywhere in batteries), iron (very common), phosporous (is used as fertilizer, common), oxygen (most common element in the crust) and silicon (second most common element in the crust).
altogether assuming set of standards is maintained and some significant number of bev hit the road it appears that we have a model in which we could put any battery pack into any bev making logistics of battery swapping no so bad as you described.
that was also better in cycling capability and because it replaced graphite with silicon it wasn't flammable.
that changes soon: making 180kwh battery pack from that prototype 540wh/kg battery would weight 333kg which makes it about 100kg smaller than roadster battery pack (90kwh should give 300 mile range to type s -size
i understand that braking is routed back into the battery, extending distance, but would it be possible or feasible to include a small turbine to harness the wind when driving to recharge the battery?
that sounds more like ordinary battery to me, but i can't find any info about e2 battery weight (only figure i do find is 84kg which sounds astounding)roy 5:00am | nov 19, 2009 timo, e1 battery weight http://www.ewolf-car.com/assets_de/presse/auto-portale/www.evworld.com.pdf synopsis: the e.1 weighs a mere 990 lbs, 594 of which are battery and it could point the way to the future of racing.
no headlights or cabin air blower (large 12v loads) • tires inflated to recommended efficiency setting 30/40 front/rear psi
your design easily would take on wind scoop to venturi portion of the system.
it sound like it would reduce the drive train losses which are second to the aerodynamic losses.
it doesn't just lock-up the wheels.
until then i think they are waste of time and effort.
if they can make some low rpm high power electric motors that would be ideal.
temperature is another important factor, both tesla and gm use water cooling.
in the term, this to be done, ev should be much cheaper than it is today.
that way you can drive around on your trip and not have to wait every 200 miles while your batt.
but unless telsa can provide more real world performance testing on their battery packs, then down the road they will find plenty of room in the proverbial ev graveyard.
join the community with more than 100 roadsters delivered to customers so far and more on the road each week, it’s natural for some customers to run “experiments” on them.
i hope there is enough insulation mechanism in the right places for protection purposes.
so they tried to improve on propeller design, improve aerodynamics, increase engine efficiency and then said, "the only way we will get more speed is with more power and more range out of our aircrafts is to carry more fuel.(sound familiar?)
but i looked at the weather report and news for shampaign usa when the tesla car was there and the weather reports said that the wind chill was dangerous, and there were photos of people having to skii out of their neighbourhoods to get around and there were trucks swept off the interstate into the ditch by the weather and yet it was 'just another day tor the roadster' a bit windy
i really think that is possible with current technology.
it is also important to note that we are discussing dc wh/mile or energy coming out of the battery pack inside the vehicle.
i am displeased about the automobile industry, because they failed to develop innovative engines.
i know that there will be people saying that this is ramped down at night tomatch demand but the generators are still running!
so if you reduce total mass by 1% then you would reduce rolling loss by about 1%.
they will find out how it behaves in the cold and in winter storms.
les schwab because they are are a full service repair shop and handle heavy equipment tires, also they are all over the west coast now.
on my blog am also comparing and contrasting electric cars with fuel cell cars.
if the average commute is 40 miles than all energy comes from the power grid.
it is cheaper and more environmental friendly than diesel and gasoline.
i want to travel to munich, let's say the main station there to pick up a friend.
also the thing that seems appealing is that after 5 years, better batteries have come out and you can actually upgrade your roadster, giving it more range.
on the other hand, if they are better than ordinary suspension _as a suspension_ then it might be worth using them.
look at "more" tab in top of the page and there "white papers" which has pdf of battery pack.
as far as i know tesla plans to be bev only and stay away from anything gas powered.
the arguments are not purely "green" - they should be about conservation of a precious resource.
they allow the vehicle to maintain the clean architecture of an electronically controlled electric motor power train.
if it radiates directly up you have only roof to collect radiation, if it is low in horizon only one side is collecting radiation assuming you car is faced 90 decree angle to sun.
the people need to get the electric supply figured out.
and that's not all, also power densities are improving, one of them allows 175kw/kg power density (meaning 200kg battery could give out 35mw meaning power to outrun nitrodragsters).
with the generator producing electricity sending it to the battery,can the motor in turn be used to produce its own power for a time or receive power from the generator.
big truck can be over four meters high, while tesla roadster is hardly one meter.
owners of evs would have to limit their trips to 200 to 300 miles round trip so they can recharge at home.
the speed of the rocket doesn't affect the thrust, as the exhaust velocity is measured in relation to the rocket itself, not anything outside the rocket.
batteries are water cooled.
while this graph shows that driving range greater than 300 miles should be possible, the conditions to do this are quite rare: steady-state driving at 30 mph (no stops or starts) for more than 10 hours!
for that low ground-clearance type s of roadster are pretty bad choices even if they could have awd.
ken: tesla motors decided not to make a "plug-in" hybrid, as their battery only design achieves a fairly good range, and with "less than one hour" charging could be practical even for long trips.
backseats doesn't have to mean making the car look like its meant for old people.
i would very much like to see ev beating nitrodragster.
so, for example, a broken cup has less order (more entropy) than an intact one, and it is more difficult to repair a broken cup (reducing its entropy) than to break an intact one (increasing its entropy).
40kwh / 84kg is 476wh/kg energy density.
to dave fisher about ev efficiensy : you are correct noticing that battery electric car still use electric energy mostly generated from fossil fuel.
jon mooring 1:29pm | jul 30, 2009 thanks for the positive feedback cm.
disregared if you already have a cool battery technology .
that means 7kw/h , which means you will need about 30h to recharge it.
most auto manufacturing in the usa is assembly, not engineering/ ip which is being offshored, outsourced.
now, that's the sort of confidence-inspiring test drive that i'd iike to see here in germany (or, for that matter, similar trips in the us).
if you used a flat 4 (subaru?) motor you could even have extra luggage space on top.
as i pointed out, rockets are self-contained, their "reaction mass" is accelerated along with the rocket, enabling a constant thrust regardless of speed (but as the rocket fires, the mass it carries decreases so acceleration increases).
for 1kwh/kg energy density that 600 miles means something like 180-200kwh battery for ordinary sedan assuming ~300wh/mile with 60mph average speed.
you don't need to test entire pack for that.
if the expense of building and maintaining they system isn't excessive, it could be economically successful, but the main drawback would be getting political support and loud complaints about "ugly wires blocking the view".
about 50kg smaller than roadster battery.
i would like to know why this type of system would not work, and extend the driving time for the tesla owners.
i am surprised to see just how high the range could possibly be, espically at speeds at 55-70 miles per hour.
http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2005/03/66833 http://www.autoblog.com/2008/06/10/bmw-gina-light-visionary-model-revealed/ fabricate the roof of the a solar panle, while it is being driven in sunny states, your range is greater, and while it is setting in the sun all day while you’re working, you are not using power from the grid, only at night and if it rains you would need to plugging.
i also don't think touchscreen is eye-friendly in dark roads.
if you are correct then that combination should cause electric engine to accelerate.
whoever sees it will see how that works.
i kind of don't trust on touch-screens in cold weathers.
i live in miami and just got back from l.a. where i had the opportunity to test drive the roadster.
tesla is doing what other auto engineers should have done long ago.
we then take about 15 steps down to the level of the cottage deck.
if a cell opens and fails you will lose a whole tube anyway and if the cells burn up in the tube it will hardly have any safety issues i see.
billb 8:15am | okt 5, 2009 gr, you highlight the situation for which evs are not (yet) well suited.
in automotive use higher efficiency is nullified by increased weight.
the real world has wind, variations in road surface, hills, occasional stops and starts and other conditions.
now that your moving to a more stable and heaver car with a better center mass, maybe the hub motors would not make handling that big of an issue.
by the way, tesla plans to install high powered "45 minute max" charging outlets for the model s, perfect for the traveller - just stop at a hiway diner with a "fast park and charge" lot, take a break, have lunch or a snack, and when you're ready to go again, so is the car!
i just wish to give to the society in which i live.
you can make them profitable only by attaching other services to them.
i have also seen types of motor that are nearly 100% efficient using fixed magnets, and even heard some rather out there claims of motors that are up to 400% efficient using fixed magnets that move in and out of shielded positions, greatly increasing efficiency...
frankly, i wanna see and ride your electric car that would greatly impact on my life.
i just wanted to make sure you have seen the electricity generating suspension component from a group of students at mit.
make the ev's consume less energy for mile.
given that you will need that ice probably 1-2 times a year it can be made even rentable.
when it needs to slow down, it transforms the motor into an alternator, slowing the car and partially recharging the batteries.
maybe all four wheels are hub-motors.
the typical full capacity of a new battery pack when charged to 100% in maximum range mode and discharged steadily over 3 hours is about 55kwh.
most taxis could run all day without a charge, but if not industrial chargers can recharge in 45 minutes.
once the large charging capacitor can be developed, and the batteries could be charged quickly, you could use only the wind on a downhill run, to charge the vehicle quickly, and could increase efficency greatly.
which means about 180miles with current battery pack.
presently the us consumes (per eia) about 10.5 billion kilowatts hours per day of electrical energy.
with that power you hardly move at all with practical car in everyday conditions.
david m. i would like to see an infrastructure of (480v, 45min) charging stations about every 150mi along the major interstates.
electricity could be generated from solar power or wind power which are practical and even business profitable technologies of electric generation today making no co2 generation while operating.
for li-ion battery it includes carbon, lithium and cobalt oxide.
your suggestion of putting solar panel instead of glass roof in type s would give you approx 200w charging in midday in very sunny day.
when the electric car is running, it's overcoming the friction from its mechanism and that from the air it displaces.
whatever ratio the transmission is varied too, the wheels will go there.
tire losses are mainly determined by the weight of the vehicle and the rolling drag of the tires themselves.
i guess it should be also a history of recharges stored in the microcontrollers of the battery pack and readable by some standard protocol.
flywheels do not have any capacity degradation over time, are relatively cheap / wh and very easy to maintain which is their main benefit over pretty much any other energy storage method.
as for completely filling battery from another battery, you don't need twice the capacitance.
installing a small wind turbined and a generator in the front bumper.
while tesla's achievements are laudable, there is a better solution than bigger and more expensive batteries.
you do have losses, but they are not big ones.
nuclear powered big ships are all electric.
on the other hand, tesla motors cars do indeed use regenerative braking, by using the motor as a generator they take advantage of that "generator drag" to both slow the car down and partially recharge the battery!
you cannot generate electricity to charge the batteries by putting a generator on the axle, or a wind turbine underneath.
you simply did have pretty much all your "facts" or claims wrong so badly that it felt like trolling.
this is not an example of free energizing, but of using the inertia of the weight of the vehicle to run a charging system to increase your distance between charge.
in the hybrid case you have a (low-ball estimate) of $1000 per car for the design plus $2000 for the parts.
of course, you could always practice the teachings of toyota, and gemba research, and steal the ideas from your sources, and demonstrate a fundament lack of respect for the principle of diversity.
in order for tesla to use the full power capability of the motor, they must use a transmission (about 8.2:1).
car companies have historically responded with accomodation, not leadership; this is the moral equivalent of a drug dealer dispensing heroin.
that is more than two days of 16 hour driving if you sleep 8 hours in between, _and_ you don't charge your car (even slowly) at night.
the vehicles could enter and leave these lanes as needed along the freeways.
@cm: tow trucks could be equipped with ac generators, allowing them to directly charge the car.
perforance, top speed 92kph, range 200-230km on one charge.
gm and some others also use weaker energy density batteries than tesla.
eight hour sleep charging with low 25kw (normal three-phase with 65a fuses) and you have full battery pack at the morning.
it is a solid, physically feasible, unique method of applying torque that has never been done before but can accomplish what i have described.
this one is harder to evaluate since i don't believe they are actually in production yet, but promise twice the range of limn polymer!arrakeen 4:14pm | feb 2, 2009 the led-daydriving-lights of the brabus teslaroadster should be standard - especially for the european version with some countries which permits to turn on lights also in bright daylight.
jon mooring 12:55pm | jul 21, 2009 i have what i believe is a symbiotic add on technology that will help solve one of your most pressing battery engineering needs of substantially increased range.
gc galactic cannibal; tesla has driven its roadster prototypes hundreds thousand miles and no correction has been made to promises, so i'm guessing that battery pack delivers what it promises (which is 100k miles or five years of useful life).
same way i just found out that electric motorcycles here in finland have ridiculous 12.5mph speed limit.
minimum work for maximum pay is not compatible with the mentality of a world-challenging startup.
again it is a car with all the comforts of a high-end luxury car.
the sunshine is free, and the panels are already paid for.
current realistic "fast charge" is about 5 min charge.
there's an all electric battery powered semi-truck being tested right now at long beach harbor cargo terminals here in ca.
tesla motors will be opening many more stores as fast as finances permit, so eventually there will be tesla stores in italy.
guys this is gold mine for me, i like all the technical stuff and all the calculations that can be made.
this could happen soon here in the us if the politicians could uncover their eyes and become less greedy.
don't get me wrong, i do hope that something like eestor system could be viable, but as it is now they lack necessary energy density to be useful.
it definitely will not be like gas-stations where people might actually need to queue to get gas.
(even 100 kw/h battery pack could be recharged in about 8-12 h at home).
so you end up with 3% energy loss instead of 5%.
jet engines draw air into the intake.
for the roadster we have chosen tires that offer a great combination of low rolling resistance and traction or grip.
joe simone 10:04am | mei 28, 2009 i read that mit is looking at nanotubes applications for ultracapacitors.
we everytime hear about "it's too short", we can answer "no more!"david e. manwell 6:07am | okt 7, 2009 how about combining the 4-motored electric car’s platform with a carbon fiber body.
regenerative "braking" is actually engine brake, and engages when you lift your feet from accelerator, not when you press the brakes.
and roadster is smaller vehicle than typical sedan.
it has usual extremely low efficiency gas engine, so it doesn't surprise me that you get bad result from that.
tesla does make the best motor in my opinion, but there are several that come close including raser (licensed to hyundai), kaisei and tm4 (only prototypes, i think), and pml flightlink.
"if we can get just to the 600 mile range while the electric car is still a niche market, beyond 500 miles, many people would just fly anyway.
i agree that if prices go down and efficiency goes up they are more that just curiosity (there is nanoantennae invention that can convert up to 80% of sun radiation to electricity which means 800w / m^2 in perfect condition).
it is interesting to see all this technology evolving for evs and its ability to get rid of all the ice baggage of gearboxes, differentials, drive shafts etc.
you're talking about increasing the mass/weight of a car by at least 50% (battery is close to half a model s's total weight, plus you'd need the trailer to lug it around).
i am guessing this energy is going for the battery pack cooling and on board computers, dashboard etc.
the "long tailpipe" argument is bogus.
a ret-telsa could replace 2/3rd of its battery volume/weight and achieve superior performance (its lighter), as well be fueled at any station, thus have unlimited range.
you wouldn't need a prototype to see that it was feasible and would work.
they also spoke of being able to extract more of the energy from capacitors in hybrid cars than from batteries.
we need a bit more affordable models with at least 400-500 mile ranges to make real breakthrough.
my question to the engineers is this; is there a way to connect a generator to the main motor so when the battery charge reads (a) certain volt(s), the circut to the generator closes starting the generator and opens the circut between the battery and the motor closing the circut between the generator and the battery?
i would not take it seriously but for the fact that most tv viewers sit on their brains and will not have subjected the statements to critical thought.
i think merging both technologies would make the electric car a clear winner in alternative fuels.
timo 12:31pm | feb 11, 2009 cablechewer wrote: ## for me i want to see an electric car that can do 600km in the depths of winter and the hieghts of summer.
however i think in some ( all be it very very few) cases if a bright idea can shown with clear drawings and a clear explanation it could be excepted by engineers as workable and they would be willing to move forward with it.
fact is that conventional car engine is very bad in turning combustion to kinetic energy.
this is probably not blog material.
same with grill -scope mounted wind generators.
regards, antonio pardon the chiche :but a chain's strength is its weakest link.
that means for 24 85kwh cars 85kw connection, which is way beyond ordinary grid connection.
it is possible to modularize the standard so that by using say 1 to 4 modules all the differences in total energy capacity requirement between cars could be covered.
you would probably also have overheated engine, broken brakes, and some gray hairs.
bottom line is that there is no alternative but to move to renewable energy sources.
electric motor is much smaller than similar power ice, so engine size is not the limiting factor.
that would mean you have to reach destination before battery depleted 2.
there will be about one billion cars out there soon (china and india are fast growing in this).
same with the touch screen.
joe; coal plant output is far lower than equivalent auto pollution per unit energy.
it's perfectly safe, but the certification regulations are written assuming you have one motor and a drivetrain, so there are some certifications (such as the one for anti-lock braking) you can't pass in a car with no drivetrain.
for more information on various "dual mode" proposals, see: http://faculty.washington.edu/jbs/itrans/dualmode.htm brian covault: tesla motors is considering a "swappable battery" for their upcoming model s, as it would certainly be a fast and convenient "refill" when on a long trip.
:-/ tesla seriously needs to put out a *lot* more information about cold weather behavior.george 7:12am | jan 6, 2010 in canada its cold.
that would weight then about that 180-200kg and take space about same as 100liter gas tank or less.
roadster uses about 250wh/mile so 100,000 miles you have used 25000 kwh.
assuming same or similar efficiency as roadster we get 244 compared to 187 = 76.5% range which would mean 54kwh
and maybe they could get one of those shows on discovery where they convert a couple cars to high performance electric and then people would see that they don't need to buy a whole new car to get the 12 -20 cents full charge or full tank price.
but who cares if you can drive 600 miles with single charge (tech to that is very near finished), and while having your lunch break you get charged to 200-400 miles more.
i answered that i haven't yet because there is no info about type s batteries, and roadster 70% after 50000 miles is way too little to me or my sister who also drives a lot.
heat can cause cellular changes pretty easily.
then the circuites would allow the solar cells to charge the battery enough to offset the drain that the cooling systems are having on the battery.
by the way, the us spends many hundreds of billions of dollars each year importing foreign oil.
for the modeling above, we assumed that there was not heating or air conditioning load, but if there were it would show up here.
that 200a @1700v is for volts too high for car to handle.
im an oilfield worker by trade but love the idea of useing less gas and oil for fuel.
roadster engine magnetic field is way too low power to cause anything.xavier 2:22am | sep 15, 2009 hi timo, for me, 4.2 miles charge a day is not so bad even if it appear "nothing".
that can mean anything between 200wh/kg and 700wh/kg, so not much use for that info.
however to generate full power from this underutilized equipment during off peak hours we will need to burn additional coal and natural gas.
well to my surprise it didn't happen the way the thought it would.
the obvious choice would be tesla locations, you could also franchise out.
after world war ii, developing your clean beautifull cars and repost stations all over.
it just doesn't make any sense when you can fast recharge your car using electricity.
anyone knows that by throttling off when driving down a hill declutching and rolling saves petrol.
would be handy to hook up with truck in the road out of nowhere.....
of course battery technology is moving forward in leaps and bounds, and this type of vehicle will drive that technology to advance at a much greater rate due to demand and supply.
we do use petroleum for other products such as plastics etc.
brian h 9:12am | jan 27, 2010 mika; glad to see you took the plunge and ordered an s! 2013 is a year after the first models are due, so you have a fair chance of getting it then, i'd say.
if the battery was removable like a heafty suit case (or as 3 or 4 smaller modular suitcases) that you could stop after 200+ miles at a location (set up agreements with a chain of service stations of truck stops) and pay a nominal fee to have the ess swapped out for a fresh one and continue on down the road.
the battery is being drained to provide this potential energy as well as surmounting the friction and wind resistance of the travel.
i liked the comment by nubo on 24th dec. about the hamster-wheel.
it is as though the tesla was intentionally designed for our real world driving.
4 wheel drive was mandatory as design criteria, as safety is reduced with two wheel drive.
billcm 8:02pm | okt 30, 2009 rawsteel, your idea of a removable "range extender" engine and generator is technically possible, but it does have some formidable engineering challenges and might not be practical.
just extend it a bit and allow backseats - and you immediately open the market to twice as many buyers.
think of something akin to a convertible rising out of the trunk and unfolding over the top of of the car during the day to gather power.txjak robert llewellyn has a new series of videos called "fully charged" and his pilot episode handles the top gear sham review of the tesla roadster pretty well.http://fullycharged.blip.tv/file/3776407/txjak
or we could just use more battery capacity for greater driving range, and quick charging during rest stops for those long trips.
re-ev has them in serial so that all the power to the tires comes from the ev and ice is used as generator to charge batteries / transfer energy directly to emotor.
next good think for tesla in eu is 220-240w power supply system (hopefully one day us will switch on this system too).
aerodynamic losses are almost entirely determined by driving speed.
while going down hill, because of the inertia of the car going down, by energizing two dc generators, one in each wheel, you would be using the inertia of the car going down hill to charge the batteries.
this is very relevant to range but does not consider the losses associated with the onboard battery charger or some of the slight round-trip energy losses in the battery itself.
cm thanks for your explanation of battery charging.
great for recovering energy while slowing down, but of no use when cruising or speeding up, and it won't give "unlimited range".
before we started burning fossil fuels in large quantities, the earth was on a slow cooling trend that would have put us into another ice age in about 20,000 years.
aleksandar 12:45am | jun 18, 2009 perfection, i think that nikola tesla would bee proud that a factory and a car like this has his name.
it might be viable *now* when batteries have still too low energy density to give 600+ mile range with reasonable price.
timo 2:53am | jul 21, 2009 to engineering: i'm curious about similar data for type s. you don't need to include range, because batteries will develop still, but base losses are my interest.
but seriously cm you at least showed an open mind enough to say you would like to see proof before you would believe it.
your b w trans. has a (8.2752:1) ratio, you also have rear wheel drive, indicating a differential.
450wh/kg prototype battery has been already made (lifepo4 cathode, si anode battery), and that isn't best potential battery
of course the us petroleum reserve is finite and have to think of the future.
has anyone considered if by declutching and rolling down the hill it might be possible to travel further (obviously without recharging battery).
your office building becomes a power plant.
from some webpage i got an impression that 300 mile version has 85kwh battery pack.

unfortunately battery ev are not race cars from a range point of view.
dave fischer 12:30pm | dec 27, 2008 as chief technology officer, maybe you could influence your marketing dept. to remove the misleading statement that the tesla roadster "burns no oil".
all i can think of is france's ariane 5 rocket that self-destructed because one of the onboard flight control modules was never updated/calibated for the ariane 5 (taken right from the much smaller, weaker ariane 4).
no question the electric car gets better mileage.
for price of one supercapacitor you get 10-100 or more high enough energy density batteries / flywheels, so capacity timeout is not battery/flywheel problem, it is capacitor problem.
it is true that it is possible to increase rpm without increasing use of force, emotor does that for wide range of rpm.
eestor wouldn't be extremely good for energy density (not anymore) but it would be a lot cheaper making car a lot cheaper to produce.
yes, power on four wheels does not help the vehicle stop.
that could solve pretty much all problems for abundance, but i haven't seen realistic aluminum battery concept.
fyird2 i just took the excel data that was provided so kindly by jb, and i changed the kwh to 90000 for the model s, as was recently claimed by elon musk, instead of the 55000 for the roadster.
the half-axle is attached to its motor through a universal joint, with the half-axle's other end joining its wheel through another universal joint (to keep the wheel vertical throughout its travel below the suspension this prevents it from tucking under in hard cornering, as the early vw beetles sometimes did, which often rolled them over).
(that is one thing why i am against battery swapping, you simply don't need it).
you can walk to a restaurant for lunch or do a bit of shopping and come back about an hour later to most of a charge.

i would want to attempt design of a tire supporting wheel motor that does not significantly increase wheel mass.
we have extensive collaborative access, and have been invited to discuss with a powerful, well funded government, engineering center.
though its wheels are each directly driven by their individual motors, they are mounted above (not "below") the suspension.
kg battery with casing is about 10% of e2 weight while 450 kg is from 1200+kg 37%, aerodynamics other affect some which doesn't count here...) guessing 10% loss, which makes that 135 miles for roadster.
looking more slippery could mean that aerodynamic doesn't increase as much, but being heavier would mean rolling resistances do increase.
regards gcjeremy lansman 5:17pm | aug 27, 2009 timo: i will answer regarding motors later, as that takes more thought, is more interesting, and is more important.
the latest solar technology is already equivalent to fossil fuels, so maybe it is even possible to make the car almost 100% power independent.
i'm all for creation of genuinely renewable energy sources, as long as that goes hand in hand with creation of a carbon neutral atmosphere, following a massive reduction of atmospheric carbon.
car makes work in order to overcome that air displacement.
therefore the wall plug he was using was 13a, 240v (50hz).
dc-dc/ac converters could charge from pretty much any electric source even solar panels if you have plenty of them.
the batteries will be many and computer controlled so when they are depleted, charged groups will supply the power while depleted batteries will go offline to be recharged in 10 seconds to superconductor levels.
after this crossover point the horsepower remains almost constant as torque * speed stays the same.
the 3 phase ac induction motor tesla developed is particularly well suited for that, it gives precise control of torque during acceleration and during regenerative braking.
timo 9:36pm | okt 21, 2009 battery changing: just made some calculations based on my sisters yearly driving (thinking i could buy her a roadster).
you can argue that smaller motors/controllers would cost less than a larger version, but not much, each would be over 1/2 the price of the single larger version.
the people who come up with those ideas, over and over, don't realize that generators and wind turbines produce drag, a resistance that is proportional to the power they produce, and on an electric car that drag would cause the motor to use more electrical power than they could produce in electricity.
using two different systems increases complexity of the system as well as weight quite a bit which affects car performance.
that's a lot of heat to dissipate.
the e1 is probably configurable with different number of batteries depending on the length of the race.
the only source of mechanical energy in the tesla roadster comes from the movement of the car itself, tapping that would slow the car down - and that is precisely what the regenerative braking is.
the gears can be used to re-generate power when braking.
that's pretty much all info i could find.
build a toy car with electric engine and windmill in top of it.
but i don't see how i can afford to live in the bay area... unless you let me sleep in the office (and have showers in the office.)
changing batteries is worse.
raize the inner wheels, somehow connect them, give the control to one of the 2 seaters and voila, you get 4 seater saloon.
roadster is like "hmmm... nice looking car".
that will also allow having much smaller battery pack and recharge more frequently, but the total price of the car will be much cheaper.
3:40pm | dec 19, 2008 sean, i think your test regime is beyond the capabilities of the car.
if customers are willing to pay a premium for these batteries, then the roadster and sedan could have almost 50% increase in range.
another thing: the tesla roadster has regenerative braking - very much so.
in that way you could get better regenerative braking energy recovery and add some power to car.
we have to give thanks to early adopters, willing to pay premium prices, so we can benefit later.
there have been huge amount of scientific research going how to make roads better and traffic more safe, but most of them just aren't viable because it just costs too much.
you can get to be representative in argentina, in any way to salute you, very carefully gabriel quirogawayne p. bishop 5:07pm | jul 19, 2009 cm, check this out: as you read this, think of my transmission concept as the "mechanical" version of a rocket engine.
aside from the safety and legal aspects of having a helicopter roter (actually, an "autogiro") on the roof of the car, it still creates more losses due to drag than the electricity it could generate.
since 1 watt is also just 1 joule/second you can easily convert wh into joules by multiplying by (60 [seconds])*(60 [minutes]).
the ice is pretty reliable these days and would only get used for long trips.
add some weight and measure again (one passenger, four passengers, five passengers and trunk full of stuff).
that's enough cash to purchase an awful lot of clean energy generation and modernized electric grid.مركز تحميل i can’t wait to own my tesla - i am planning on the family sedan model :)
imagine roadster with 800 mile range, or over 200 kg lighter battery pack and still 400mile range.
fyi this looks like a possible breakthrough in battery technology and likey to a have major impact in the next few years.
losing no battery energy for snappier aceleration would violate laws of physics.
so when the customer comes to the car a week later, the charge of the battery is still half full, justy like when they left the car sitting a week ago, even if the temperature all week had been extremely hot.
do more than just figure out how to sell an electric car to the conventional consumer interested in protecting the environment.
the amount of power available.
i see your car on tv, that was perfect and beautiful car that i ever have seen in my life.
electric motor already does this in very wide rpm range.
when you increase rpm with transmission you lower torque output that input power source is giving you.
the existing batteries are 18650 form factor 2.2ah and although much more expensive, there are better batteries available such as http://industrial.panasonic.com/www-cgi/jvcr13pz.cgi?e+ba+3+aca4001+ncr1... which are panasonic's nrc18650 rated at 2.9ah.
efficiency can't go over 100%, and roadster already is about as close to 100% as you can get.
the electric car will be truly tempting once it offers not only great driving performance, but also a battery that lasts at least 10 years and costs less than $10k to replace.
even just 110v@10a is 1.1kw. with that is takes you about 31 hours to charge that missing 120 miles worth of 300 mile range (40% of 85kwh type s battery = 34kwh).
what you are using in ev is electricity, not batteries.
anyway, 3 hours there and 3 hours back on the same day is a lot of driving for not much time at destination.
it seems that the wind pushing against the vehicle could be put to good use.
also, coal fired power plants can use efficiency boosting devices too large for automotive use, their efficiency is arount 45%.
with a 30m cord i can reach the spot where the cars park.
if not, then i suppose the motor would have to be mounted near the wheel itself, power transferred via a cv joint.

wind mills could also charge the batteries with free electricity would be neat to have a charger adjustable for any voltage 12 volts or more although the 200+ amps would be a challenge on the parts
another near 580 and 5 intersection, then south, fresno, bakersfield... just place them at strategic locations that are easily accesable from the interstates.
by utilizing a 240 or 480 volt generator, you would recharge the batteries quicker than using a 120 volt system.
this solution also makes it possible to build a generator system for your home that will completely eliminate your monthly electric bill.
crude but it worked and had its own form of raw beauty.
for about 1000v system you would still need over 2000amps to do that 5 min charging.
they are basically ice engines hooked to a generator to create electricity.
but i did see the one with the ford gt that clockson actually bought, i think that had a range of about 75 miles on the test track, surely 55 miles (73% of the fords range) from the tesla is outstanding and only helps to confirm its viability as a performance electric car.
like i wrote earlier geothermal alone has potential for several thousand times world current use of electricity.
it does not matter at what rate the fuel is being burnt.
we cant make a global electric power stations in just few years, that's not very hard to figure out.
you will normally charge up at home, but if on a trip, you will change out the batt.
a curious remark by elon a while back was that the model s batteries would be much superior to the current roadster batteries.
so what would be interesting to see is a worst-case range figure achieved by flooring it to max speed, then braking as hard as possible to stop, and repeating until the battery is depleted (preferably on a wind-free day.)
if it is really cold, or really hot as in california the power drain while sitting may be greater.
the services would be tracked electrically, i expect the cells each have serial #s and each cell is entered into the database when they are installed, and since you are paying for a 5yrs of battery life it doesn't matter which ess you have at the end of the time.
recharge station doesn't have space- or weight-problem like cars do.
only a nefarious, modern day, pirate could create the label of thermo-dynamics, and then claim that nobody can understand the principles of yin and yang as well as he does.
couldn't find battery portion of e2 with 900kg total weight.
tunnels and parking halls won't need so much ventilation.
for flywheels i found several articles, example this one: http://www.itpower.co.uk/investire/pdfs/flywheelrep.pdf that shows that flywheels aren't exactly cheap either (initial cost around $1000/kwh) but their maintenance costs are very low and usable lifetime decades long.
by opening a small port in the front of the tesla, and inserting a small squirel cage air driven divise, you can divert some of the kinetic energy that blows against the car and direct it to run a small alternator that would feed current back into the battery system, thus easily recharge the and extend the daily life of the batteries as you go.
these overhead umbilical dollies can even be designed to change lanes in much the same manner that trains can change tracks.
probably also $1m price-tag.
timo 3:56am | nov 4, 2009 another bit of ewolf -car: "each flat cell (the battery has a total of 84) weighs just 1 kg and measures 23 x 18 cm.
the asian market is the one that is expanding very rapidly and welcomes current and new car makers into the market, with promise of profits (i.e. india, china, japan being a car lover country, etc.).
## the ice would then turn on at a pre-determined battery level and top-you-up as you drive giving almost a whole day of highway cruising.
once carb is convinced the system works and could be applied to our interstates, it becomes a symbiotic relationship between the state, private ev owners and commercial trucking companies going green.
so a 70kw battery pack with 1h additional stop during a long travel will top you out at 500 miles.
looking at new peugeot's diesel engines they achieve astonishing 70 mpg (probably driven at 55) that is about 15kw power needed to push the car so the ice must be able to produce at least 15kw for 70mpg at 55 = about 19 kwh/galon given the 54 kwh battery at the tesla this means recharging it in 3h (including the losses probably) now take note that the diesel engine i am quoting is 2liter.
if a car traveled 100 miles, it took 24 kwh of electricity to recharge, and electricity were 10 cents per kilowatt hour (kwh), it would cost $2.40 to go 100 miles and its mpd would be 42.
in fact you might easily get lower drag coefficient with larger car, which in turn makes that difference even smaller.
this is very informative, though i must admit, i'm still a little lost on some of this stuff.
you are transferring energy from those rockets to that wheel that accelerates.
each of these "wheel motors" is rigidly attached only to the frame (at its center sill) not the hub, placing it above (not "below") the suspension, so "unsprung weight" is not increased.
i think future electric cars will be small, minimalistic oriented, every inch will be used as much as possible.
you could draw from the wheels power as well as the battery delivering the necessary power at the relative speed.
despite the listing, it is only 12.5kva, at pf 0.8, so only 10kw avail.
this prevents that wheel/ha assembly from tucking under in hard cornering, as the early vw beetles sometimes did, which often rolled them over.
this battery type is also available from http://www.electrovaya.com/ .
can you imagine how much power can be generated on that down hill ride, that could get you farther on your way when you get to the bottom.
for example it would be a fixed charge for single battery module swap.
and i believe that 300 miles makes that price-tag a bit higher (somewhere in $65k i would guess).
the article even references the roadster.
heating and cooling of battery pack is also already implemented as part of existing tesla roadster design.
gas guzzlers both use oxygen and emit toxic gases, but not ev:s. that means serious savings in closed space ventilation costs, and also increased safety in accidents in tunnels.
but yes, the real solution will come when affordable, and especially cheap, batteries are developed that are truly practical in filling all the needs of a typical driver.
the fact that most of the power in the usa comes from either coal or nuclear technology is insane.
timo 6:26am | mei 25, 2009 joshua maxwell; i found online store for those maxwell ultracapasitors.
range achieved, battery chemistry used etc.
many customers, potential customers and curious observers want the details behind this average and how results may change depending on conditions.
best batteries today already offer that range if used like batteries in roadster battery pack are used (but they cost more).
similarly, by reducing vehicle mass you see a proportional reduction in rolling loss.
indeed, electrical to mechanical conversion efficiency is not a simple matter, but my impression reading about wind generators using three phase pm energy generators is that they can be very efficient at low rpm.
in the 20's and 30's you could buy it in hardware stores.
full weight of the system could be somewhere around 100 kg (maybe 50kg engine, tiny gearbox for that for getting right steady rpm for generator, fuel and generator itself).
underground high voltage induction cable that charged the vehicle as the car moved could be installed as well.
the other thing you could do is to use the downward force of inertia when you are going down hill to generate power back to the batteries, instead of having to break as much, kind of like regenerative brakeing, but it would be on all the time the car is coasting on its own inertia.
however, this is just one data point; real-world range can vary substantially depending on driving style, environmental conditions, and usage of accessories such as the electric cabin air conditioning system and the electric cabin heating system.
normal household three-phase 100a connection cable is way smaller than that, and gives you about 40kw connection.
one drawback is that the nearest tesla stores are in munich and monaco, a long ways to go for service.
likewise, i would assume that a123 and altair nano's nanosafe technology would be better as well.
ice range is still bigger, but about 700 miles is over breakpoint (10 hours of driving at 60mph average speed), which means that you need to rarely recharge even in longer road trips and when you do you can choose which "recharge station" you would like to use to get where you are going and are not forced to use always same one (these recharge stations obviously don't exist yet).timo 2:54am | mei 25, 2009 joshua maxwell; flywheels have very high efficiency: about 95-98% (basically electric engine/generator efficiency).
i also envision an electro magnetic coupling system allowing for automatic connect and disconnect to or from the dollie.
you are correct that if they were in a tube, series wired, one failure would make the whole tube useless.
“each flat cell (the battery has a total of 84) weighs just 1 kg and measures 23 x 18 cm.
mika; one thing that concerns me is that if there is a display or software problem the car becomes unusable.
(californians developed strong environmentalist movement, but rest of us is really ecological "retarded";-( ).
talking about solar panles, my house is already packed with 36 cis module, delivering a peak 2700kw.
which is more efficient, generating electricity in power plant and then run that electricity in ~80% efficiently in ev or burn fossil fuel in gasoline car with very low efficiency + refining process losses?
power is the rate of flow of energy, higher power means more energy transferred in a given amount of time, meaning faster charging (assuming the batteries can handle the higher charging rate).
having enough packs charging in parallel would match changing time under 15 min so that battery packs could be swapped without delays.
so,yes, their prices will go down.
about that five minute charging: it is not the battery that is limiting that in future, it is capability to safely transfer that much energy at that little time.
what should be looked at are energy density, safety and price of the batteries.
if the oil disappears we will use our food resources to create more oil so we can burn it as gasoline and pollute the earth more.
it seems that my info about lithium shortage was simply wrong.
if we apply this same increase in type s 300 mile battery we get 414 miles which would be enough for me :-) :-).
you are subject to magnetic and electric fields in ev, yes, but those have no effect on human beings.
actually i think many just use steam from the reactor to run steam turbines.
now i can make the trip in my corvette with only 2 stops for fuel.
just the extra weigh alone will cut your range back so far that your two batteries will take you no further than you'd go without the trailer battery connected.
longer than that and there's already a better alternative to driving, most of the time (train or plane for big destinations, atv or snowmobile for the middle of nowhere :-) ), or you can arrange charging facilities at the far end.
i literally cannot tell the difference between some american, european and japanese sedans.
ronald wose: good idea, but it needs to be cooridnated with the government as they own the roads, and with several auto makers as no one company would have sufficient market share to make "powered roads" practical by themselves.
for most typical driving trips, a 5kw (or so) generator would probably be adequate.
that is over 1.7 times roadster battery pack.
also, i thought this was interesting: a novel approach to "storing"electricity in aluminum.
these are thoughts and don't diminish the accomplishment of this vehicle.
by my calculations, having battery packs more than 50-100 kw/h is not going to help a lot (even if better battery technology is developed later), and i think that way because imagine you have a car with 200 kw/h battery pack.
so, i'm going to need a $45k electric for commutes plus a $20k+ gas model for the longer hauls.
i found few german pdf with mention that e1 has 180 kg battery.
has anyone does this analysis for the model s?al hook """if a car traveled 100 miles, it took 24 kwh of electricity to recharge, and electricity were 10 cents per kilowatt hour (kwh), it would cost $2.40 to go 100 miles and its mpd would be 42.
note that those efficiency differences are the same regardless of size, whether it is a truck, a big suv, a sports car, or a tiny sub-compact.
i expect that it would impact general public much more than anything else done this far.
but if the engineering team at tesla turns around and takes the precautionary position, this could be a huge selling point for you - just a simple cost-benefit analysis.
i bet we could create ev that gets similar result as some porsche using battery to battery charging.
not hugely useful for automotive use (unless you are building a dragster), but for phones and laptops with low energy batteries, yes.
having an actual working model will prove that it works and the idea is sound and you hadn't overlooked some obscure point.
tksbrian h 8:44pm | jan 28, 2010 olda; the car is heated electrically, including direct seat heating.
solar is even greater source.
electric car has ability of regenerative braking.
smaller size generally means less efficiency in electric motors.
tesla battery (not entire pack, but batteries) is only about 300kg so that would be 300/84 x 187 = 667 miles.
i believe the astm propulsion system is the answer to the "all electric" vehicle's range problem.
and by the way: did you see the "lightning car" that uses a123 batteries and claims it can recharge for 300km in 10 minutes.
it is at night when there is a great deal of excess capacity, so, charging your electric car at night is an ideal situation for everyone, including the utilities.
the nanotube coating also allows twice the voltage over current technology.
timo 5:25pm | mrt 23, 2009 kevin cardinale: in-wheel motors may reduce transmission losses about 30% of less than 5% what it is now.
a trailer is cumbersome, large enough to make all driving maneuvers more protracted (try parking with a trailer sometime, see how much effort it takes), hinders vehicle movements, and utterly kills speed, acceleration, and range.
that is a lot of batteries or flywheels.
if the electric motor can eventually spin the wheels at 13,000 rpm, then (wow!).
not an experiment i would want to try with a car that costs upwards of $110k (base price; delivery, options selected and a charging station or two add to it fast).timo 6:04am | jan 19, 2010 mika; that's entirely possible.
but it's cool/ http://hydrogen.ecn.purdue.edu/2005.10.28-woodall/ range extension: it seems to me that if the maximum changing rate is 16.8 kwh, and if the maximum discharge rate of a new 100% charge battery is 55 kwh, that the maximum mathematical range extended device would only add ~30% to the range given all variables are equal and the load minus converter losses is greater than 55 kwh draw from the new battery.
they feel that coating the ion collecting area with nanotubes can increase the surface area by 5 to one.
poor helpless gas guzzler.
is it money and power of a gasoline lobby or the oil companies that is keeping that from happening?!?!roy 6:20pm | sep 28, 2009 gr, hydrogen fuel cell cars are electric.
those charging stations would be used only by long-range road trips so if you wait for half a hour every eight hours to get your car charged it isn't that bad.
with 100% efficiency in energy conversions you end up +- zero gain, but because there is always losses in energy conversions you end up losing more than you gain.
ideally you wouldn't need to carry the generator on journeys when you didn't need it, but it would require some sort of exhaust and air intake modifications to wherever you fit it in the car.
right now our electrical power is supplied from 50% coal burning, 20% natural gas and 20% nuclear and the rest from hydro, oil, wind solar.
these nono batteries will be able to absorb energy directly from the environment and there will never be any need to plug the car in to recharge the battery.
whoever is taking promotional pictures about tesla cars could use some advices from him.

we have started a green car initiative realizing our ret-genset can be sized to provide, green, light power (mechanical and/or electric) for autos.
it is a 1000 mile trip, which is just about the maximum distance a heathy person can drive in a day.
in-wheel motors are weaker and less efficient than tesla one motor solution so you would actually lose some efficiency.
from you pushing the car to the re-charge station, to cooking out of there at 140mph in under 5 minutes.
heck, los angeles to las vegas and back would be impressive enough.
i myself live in about 1m people city and not all of us own a car because we simply don't need one.
because so much of the charging will be slow opportunity charging in places like workplace parking lot and home there is not much demand of those chargers except to draw people in.
it might be more practical (though less elegant) to mount the range extender in a trailer towed behind the car, or just have it permenantly mounted in the car.
if you are about to get stranded you can go pick up a tow-able.
(this is one thing ev's make possible which simply can't be done feasibly with combustion engines.)
as you can see from the graph, this can have a huge impact on overall wh/mile with even very small changes in wind.
the time to do this could not be better and may be critical not just economically but also to national security.

these charging lanes can be installed very cheaply on the special lane, and could extend throughout the state.
it seems to me, that a simple test to yield the best real world figures is to install a recording device on as many cars as possible including those already delivered.
then you only need manufacturing plants.
electricity is cheap and people charge their cars at their homes, so getting those stations profitable is a challenge.
it is also important to note that we are discussing dc wh/mile or energy coming out of the battery pack inside the vehicle.

i guess if it weights 200 pounds its not mountable/portable.
licensing would be easy as they could be licensed as trailers.
tesla motors provides a 3 year/36,000 mile warranty on the roadster with an optional 4 year/50,000 mile extended warranty available at an "additional cost" (2008 roadster buyers received the 4/50 extension at no cost while later purchasers need to pay).
2.second law of thermodynamics the entropy of an isolated system not in equilibrium will tend to increase over time, approaching a maximum value at equilibrium.
ron w/ronald wose electricity can be produced by wind energy by the installation of large wind mills as seen on the altamont pass, operated by pge, and would be cleaner than using coal plants, and the power delived to the special charging lanes on the freeways.
if not for driving and charging then smart charger + that kind of generator and stop for charging.
"what most don’t know is a lituim battery causes more pollution to the environment then gasoline."

with same design as roadster it should have nearly 80 mile range.
there is no real efficiency advantage to a "high torque low rpm only" design, except perhaps for a fraction less friction, and that advantage would be lost to friction in any variable speed transmission.

for all the would be engineers out there who devise ways to recharge batteries while in transit.
you essentially have four generators producing energy at all times.
that would impress a whole lot of people.
a somewhat better 'countryside' train network would reduce the breakpoint to about 250 miles, which tesla is already promising to be able to do reliably on the model s. western europe already has a dense train network and the breakpoint there is probably more like 120 miles, which can already be achieved routinely; as soon as europe gets mass-production electric cars the gas cars will just go away.
since the average commuter distance is about 40 miles the reev could on average get almost all of it energy from the power grid.
after all, recharging does take about "45 minutes".
if battery packs could be swapped in 10-20 sec that would manage decent racing periods.
the key is as you say of ultra capacitors having low density.
electrocution danger is probably less than burning in gasoline fire.
i love what your company is doing and how i believe you will lead the field in our cars on our roads.
if you have a wheel with say two small rocket jets located at opposite sides so as when they thrust they put say a 10 ft-lb torque on the wheel.
everybody is charging their cars in their homes, and charging stations are needed _only_ for long road trips.
type s looks much more slippery than roadster, so i guess it might have same or less aerodynamic resistance even that it is bigger car.
there is no magic here that get over 5 times the range with a similar lithium ion technology.
you cannot just hook these directly to the wheels and maintain performance without a transmission.
the only reason for that is probably to have a conversion ration for the rpms for the electric motor.
for mass circulation of ev for the consumer is determing if he or she can drive to work an back, shopping or lunch in between maybe, in city and on highway and country road as well without charging.
car).scott 5:34pm | jul 16, 2009 note to engineers: think outside the box a little more, this is a cool car but americans will not buy it enmasse.
you just have to settle on results from simulations and assumptions made from road testing.
it really isn't a good idea to drive around with the brakes on, even if they are regenerative, no matter where they are located.
i will not bother you wiyh this , again.
a capacitor bank big enough to store the same 53 kwh that the roadster battery holds would weigh about 6 tons and be the size of a semi truck trailer.
i would guess the power grid probably has at about 50% extra capacity during off peak hours for charging ev batteries.
for thelatest powertrain configuration (powertrain 1.5), we have demonstrated dynamometer test results of 244 miles range in a complicated combination of highway and city drive cycles defined by the epa.
under these conditions electric cars could not get any significant market penetration any time soon.
i guess the reason why ferrari (the new california, gorgeous; every curve is a masterpiece), bmw, mb (2 seater amg), bentley, aston martin, etc are some of the few brands that keep on top year after year; they finetune their designs.
we’ve validated the model by testing at a reduced number of points -- enough to give us good confidence in the results.
also with simple helicopter blading (i.e. maintain blades attached to the generator in autorotative condition and constant rpm via pitch control ) you can have an onboard charging system that would at the very least extend your range further.
for 4wd range rover -kind of car hub-motors would be _very_ nice, but for normal family car they are not that good.
conventional car causes several times more pollution than bev including manufacturing and supply process.
no fuel cost, no maintenance costs associated with gas engines (oil changes, filters, tune-ups, etc.).
timo 11:52am | mrt 25, 2009 i just got my latest nature volume and it had quite interesting article about magnetism that makes possible to build "spin batteries" that convert magnetic energy directly to electric energy.
cvt's were introduced years ago, and are not in several different vehicles such as the nissan maxima.
gm volt doesn’t exist yet, so it might be that it doesn’t get any miles per charge before gm goes bankrupt.
swapping doesn't make any sense for plug-in hybrids, or slow speed "neighborhood electrics", and if "thousand mile" batteries become practical they wouldn't use it, either.
big saloon cars are probably not going to work.
three of these capacitors per charge bay would be enough to charge a car http://www.maxwell.com/ultracapacitors/products/modules/bmod0063-125v.asp.
i believe that in fact well-behaving rear-wheel or front-wheel drive car is safer than 4wd car in speed-induced slide.
the horizon is really looking good.
its storage capacity is large, though, so it might see the light of day.
driving into the wind for 1 mile and then turning around to drive downwind for the same 1 mile (all at the same speed) will use more energy than driving the same speed with no wind over 2 miles.
on the other hand, that kind of thrilling acceleration and power makes it easier to sell that $50k luxury car.
it is as agile as porsche gt3 which costs a bit more than roadster and loses to aston martin db9 only teeny weeny bit in performance.
they are also investigating techs that allow very rapid charging (10 min charging was mentioned, but not how big battery pack could be recharged that fast).
if you need to drive longer you need charging station, but i think for that half hour or even one hour charging for additional 200+ miles is fast enough (you take one hour brake in driving while car is charging).
type s is, like you said, a bit overkill for commuting, but not quite enough for longer road trips.
can you provide some consumption data for the headlights, radio, seat heaters, cabin heater, air conditioner, etc.?
type s will be bargain in performance/luxury -scale.
are there certified repair shops in nyc?alessandro 10:25pm | mrt 29, 2009 anke, tesla has started a cooperation with smart car, 1000 cars will be sold.
we could have big ev and big wind& solar.
one of the reasons i picked these panasonic batteries is because they have the same nominal voltage.
they could also make money by providing power back to the grid when not charging cars.
adding capacitors would add weight without adding much range.
no? first let the way open then see how people react to them.
say the vessel is large enough to carry two sets of batteries, (50 ft in length, with hydrofoil capacity,) and has a small generator on board to recharge the batteries not in use at the time.
lithium battery price comes from something else than materials.
gas is only in a station, electricity is everywhere, or close enough.
with a front to back ratio of 35/65, the cornering forces will tend to make the car over steer and that might explain why the car didn't do as well as i thought it would on the video timed lap.
so i'm planning to visit north america to experience some of real knowledge such as hybrid car and the product made of lithuim ion cells.
kg power density 1800w/kg max.
however, i have no illusions that i'm rescuing the planet, except to the extent that driving a lighter, medium power car can help.
larry troutman: any wind turbines in front generate more wind resistance than they generate electricity, so those would be worse than useless.
i'd like to take modest little babysteps with my smart dollie overhead rail system by building a small subscale example course on mammoth mountain that powers electric mountain bikes up ski runs.
very good at checking if your real speed and measured speeds are same).brian h 4:39am | sep 20, 2009 alan; not tea bags!
that would be a natural range extender for the tesla cars could get more tac breaks for the customer whne buying and savings when using.
nuclear plants probably have constant energy output.
a working demonstration is much better than saying "i've got this great idea" (which they've already heard waaay too many times).
dan, capacitors, even ultracapacitors, have a much lower energy density than even lead acid batteries.
the system positions the car, deploys some mechanical means of removing the depleted battery pack and installing a fresh pack.
1.1ah nominal voltage 3.2v energy density 95wh/
while the capacitors banks could be charged in a matter of 30 after recharging a car and would only need close for regular business hours.
i don't believe in battery swapping either, that is just too costly in long term for swap stations.
lewis chandler and mike olsen: energy from car movement comes from electric engine, it is not free energy.
they said, "you can't have constant thrust without more power because the air you are pushing against moves away faster and faster as the speed increases."
they might not be using best batteries tech-wise but they are using a very good compromise.
first, electromagnetic leakage would represent loss of energy thus lower efficiency.
however if you make it smaller (as 15kw is not much power - about 20 hp) probably under 1l very compact engine can produce such power at similar rates.
so for high end cars because cost is no issue i believe we would see more and more fully electric car models coming in next few years.
a portion of this potential energy will also have to be used in surmounting the friction and wind resistance of the downhill run.
maybe it's too soon to discuss the pricing of options, but at least it would be neat to have the model s, as well as the roadster, under the various tabs, such as the "design" tab, where there are detailed pictures of the exterior and interior, as well as the ability to see what the car looks like in the various colors available.
randy reynolds: "power" is just the flow rate of energy, and there are no unlimited energy sources available.
while not ideal for home use it is great for recharge stations which could use a combo of wind and solar technologies to slow charge the capacitors.
since that was shortest, not fastest route that means speed limits are mainly 62.5 and 50 mph with some pretty slow parts (37.5 mph or slower) here and there.
but when i emailed back to him asking if it would be ok to call him i didn't here any more back.
basically such dependence on driving pattern makes it harder to compare just mpg numbers introducing wide variety of opinions about prius efficiensy.
you get more em radiation from sun every sunny day.
also, i would like to see a couple of major hotel chains have 220v charging capability for overnight recharging along the major highways.
another important aspect of the li-tec battery with cerio® flat cells is its cycle stability and unrivalled service life (10 years) and range (over 300 km).
for the roadster we have chosen tires that offer a great combination of low rolling resistance and traction or grip.
that's why i assumed that the new lipo technology would provide better energy density and power output.
as i described above i believe these are 3 batteries of 90 kg each.
it is true that you lose a lot if you use big suv to transport one person, but for energy usage it would be most efficient to use train or a bus full of people.
in some applications, such as boat transmissions, they can transmit power through the hull.
battery break through s are happening almost daily now and is leaving the fuel cell camp in the dust.
those alone make it impossible to hugely improve car range without getting better power supply.
i don't think they researched their material very well before scripting the prog.
tesla does not have very good pictures about roadster.
that would require 2000v 200a charging system.
## this would be a trailer with a small engine and fuel tank attached to a generator with a special trailer plug that talks directly to the pem.
e-wolf e1 is open wheel single seater that weights only about 500kg.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_naval_reactor quote: "u.s. naval reactors are pressurized water reactors, which differ from commercial reactors producing electricity..." "the russian, us and british navies rely on steam turbine propulsion, the french and chinese use the turbine to generate electricity for propulsion.
nor would it prevent battery improvements, the leasing company could, over time, replace older batteries with new improved versions, a data chip on each battery pack would enable programmable controllers on the cars to work with any new type of battery!
the pack is designed to prevent catastrophic cell failures from propagating to adjacent cells, even when the cooling system is off.
hint: gravity can be your friend.
so here's my plea for you model s engineers: pedal-actuated regen brakes, plus a driver-adjustable built-in "auto" regen to simulate the feel of engine braking when you back off the throttle.
roadster does not have real gearbox.
we can't create energy any more than we can destroy it.
of course that was not full engine it had many parts stripped out (cooling, exhaust, etc.), but it also was _old_
stopping for an hour for lunch (with the generator still running) would add back 10kwh to the battery (another 2 hours of driving).
sign me up, i want to join your teamsusan 11:19am | sep 25, 2009 very interesting and informative.
the power to recharge my roadster costs about $6 for a standard charge and i get about 200 miles, so that's about 3 cents per mile.
i wouldn't worry about electro-magnetic radiation from the car, for two reasons.
that mean more transmision lines (oh people will be happy about that ) and more power generating capacity.
i would like to see what kind of experiences people are having using them.
whoever sees it will say "oh, i see, that's how to do it" another amazing feature inherent in it's design is that torque(from wheels) is transferred to the transmission as the transmission is down ratiod but not from the transmission to the motor.
and use that 250 billion for geothermal and solar power plant development and production, get everybody their own roadster or type s or electric porsche and your entire country would be free from foreign oil in no time.
even that tesla will be first in business, there are others that follow, and i would be very surprised if they had same configuration as tesla for their batteries.
brian 6:29pm | aug 16, 2009 http://www.sony.net/sonyinfo/news/press/200908/09-083e/index.html i wonder if these new sony lithium ion batteries would be an improvement to the ones that tesla is using.
i don't know how long lithium-titanate battery have been around, i suspect they've been around for some time, seeing as the company that makes them is 50 years old.
i have awd, and sometimes need it to get where i need to go.
that is quite a lot of energy to transfer wirelessly.
just like you might rent a flatbed truck from home depot once a year to haul a big load of lawn mulch, rent a car for the 1000 mile drive and enjoy the benefits of electrics doing what they're good at the rest of the year.
richardmichaeled jb straubel, i have an idea that would work to increase the range of electric vehicles.
there are a few tricks we could use too, these are still on the "hand sketches" stage but the way things are going i wouldn't be surprised if they would actually work.
battery swaps are technically feasable, but i'm not certain whether it will be used enough to be successful as an ongoing business.
and now a word from journal of power sources: a recent article (accepted 12 june 2009) discussing about silicon-carbon composite anodes lists full battery capacity of 400+wh/kg with 0.13% loss in cycle capability.
timo and michael you mentioned gyros for the charging station i don't see who they would work efficiently for electrical power transfer or storage.
the maximum recharge would take about 60 kwh, at 12 cents a kw it would come to $7.20, just as timo said.
i hope they can hold the lead by learning from other presentation in the world.
i suspect childhood trauma, probably causing lesions in the left temporal lobe.
bshumberger 5:10pm | jun 25, 2009 something too simple for intellectuals to understand?cm 8:57pm | jun 26, 2009 bshumberger, an alternator is just a device to turn mechanical energy into electrical energy.
tesla cars are already set up with with an interlock to prevent driving while plugged in for charging.
solar radiation is about 1kw/m^2 at a good sunny day.
same volume with 30-40% increase in range.
let me know if tesla is interested in learning more about the astm propulsion technology.
the last thing the oil companies want is to see customers charging their cars at home.
i haven't read anywhere that i could find where a cvt transmission was tried.
sorry, it would actually reduce range.
dunno about roy, but i think the range is actually a mere 500 miles.
same 408kg battery would have about 39kwh energy, and used in full acceleration it would last 39*3600/736 = 190 seconds.
the car should not be operable without unplugging.
the more passenger weight you have in the car, the more electricity generated on your down hill quest.
this would also extend the range of your vehicle tremendously.
permenent magnet motors are no more efficient than the induction motor tesla is using, but they are more expensive.
timo: possibly this link will help in understanding magnetic storage http://www.physorg.com/news156011642.html .
youtube is awash with videos, just not the ones i'm on about.
all you would need is slow charging pole in the place you usually park your car to eliminate need of charging stations.
i think that cold batteries wouldn't even be able to recharge.
if the car could travel 60 miles on a gallon of gasoline, its mpd would be 20.
may be in 20-50 years we can have power roads, swapping batteries is totally not viable so stop proposing it almost every day.
the fact remains that the average driving distance is about 40 miles per day and having more range will not put a bigger burden on the power grid.
much better to simply be towed to the nearest available charging outlet.
battery swap stations more widely seperated, and regular charging plugs placed at parking spots.
it is disappointing to hear that that because your factory is the leader in electric vehicles.
with 600 mile range over 90% of cars don't use those charging stations at all.
i'll admit i haven't read all of the posts so you may have covered this already.
this high torque at the wheels makes it possible for tesla to achieve their 4 second 0-60mph time.
may be this would be the way to go to get rid of oil but still keep conveniences of personal transportation.
i do agree that if you are driving three hours to a destination, you are probably going to be there long enough to recharge.
instead of or in addition to charging stations, have swap stations where one drives a car into a station similar to an automated car wash.
given that ceramic engines are viable nowadays, and can be run with a synthetic or bio-derived lubricant, this would likely keep the green footprint that you've aimed for.
though i share my name with the company i am not affiliated with them in any way its just a happy coincidence.
one question, dave: which gas company gives you money for distributing these plain wrong informations?anatoly moskalev 6:30pm | jan 2, 2009 to timo : sure if somebody figures out how to swap heavy battery pack in ev such cars could be managed as nice race cars.
there is no point of changing those battery techs all of time (logistics, etc.), just do it when there is clearly better battery available.
with the ast (all speed transmission) i can "apply" an available torque (motor) directly to a higher rpm system (wheels) without gearing up to do so, which would decrease torque.
also: read that maxwell ultracapacitor data sheet.
i believe that porsche are trialling an electric 911 but the batteries and weight are enormous.
i'd bet my bottom dollar that the type of people who have or will buy this type of car are of the the right mind to participate with a minimum of incentive.
so maybe advancements in the charging technology alone could solve the 'problem'.
i think you meant 30 to 40 cubic inch engine.
in cities with excellent light traffic ways using bicycles gets you in your destination faster than with car.
which is about the same as the cost of one charging station with installation.
i am still waiting for mb to just extend their sl 63 amg and add backseats to it.
for example, it takes x amount of hours at 80 miles per hour to travel 500 miles because the are 3 charges required, vs x amount of hours at 55 miles per hour because there are 2 charges required.
however, all of those kinds of 'add-ons' will disappear anyway, once the batteries themselves are up to the task.
todd stiers to answer my own question about mpg vs gpm is this site, which states the case for measuring gallons/fuel per x miles to compare vehicles http://www.mpgillusion.com/ apparently, stating consumption this way makes it clear that removing inefficient vehicles is much more effective than improving efficiency in overall energy usage (hence the illusion).
liam mullen: for point five: tesla has fully crash-tested their cars, and their ess cuts all power off in case of accident.
so if you are driving into a 10 mph headwind, it is nearly the same as driving 10 mph faster from an aerodynamic loss point of view.
for now let us ignore the efficiency of converting “gasoline energy” to miles traveled and the efficiency of charging ev batteries and transferring the stored energy to miles traveled.
which works out just fine, since that also allows for picking up a bag of burgers a couple of times as well as nature breaks.
the range extender weight is offset by reducing the battery to better optimize it for the average commute distance.
the other issue to keep in mind is that these losses are determined by relative wind speed over the vehicle -- not necessarily the speed over the ground.
you would need that same amount of power to charge those swap-batteries / car served, and those car batteries cost a lot.
btw 65kg isn't that small for engine less than one liter.
this could affect your europe sales quite a bit.
tesla roadster is quite cheap for its performance.
the model s seems to be heavy enough to safely tow a trailer of at least 1500kg.
this would reduce the delay in charging the vehicles.
performed well but reliability issues and loss of charge versus time to recharge were badly slated by jermey clarkson.
no gas-tanks to blow up or ice to use valuable oxygen.
rob haven't been many posts here for awhile so just wanted to say that this info, jb, is part of why i love tesla so much!
you time in the road is extended by two hours.
first freeze can happen early september, especially at higher elevations.jeremy lansman timo: understanding, and designing motors is a field of its own, and not being paid to do this, i just don't have time or understanding to make definitive statements.
they do not convert as much energy into electricity, but therefore you don't even know it is there.
now that i saw it i realized that i remembered wrong, it had one wheel in front and two in back.
it can be done quite easily with current technology, becoming a new x-treme game sport that's all electric.
the commericial station version will be more sophisticated with rfid technology allowing you to charge your credit card at the same time.
in fact if the car has higher acceleration, that means it also has higher regenerative braking and that leads to slightly more milage.
there is no protection from the weather, and it would just be a standard 3 prong ext.
i would think it would be far less then the cost of filing up a car with gas.tomthemd 3:03am | jul 27, 2009 i figure that all necessary lights are already in led technology.
soon you might get 1000km range with half the price if battery tech advances like it seems to do.
for example all ww2 submarines used batteries when submerged and some of them were faster submerged than surfaced.
i say 84+kg because the 84kg is just for the cells and there has to be packaging and at least minimal bms included in the total battery.
i have been fascinated with tesla for several years and have read literally every word on this web site.
the physics law mentioned was established since year 1842 by direct experience of the whole humanity.
best i could find was this: http://www.zsw-bw.de/info/current/365orte/barenschee.pdf that shows that they have 200wh/kg battery that has excellent cycling capability (over 2000 cycles with 90% capacity which equals about 400000 miles running in roadster).
now with the partnering of daimler, tesla will be able to match anyone in any category.
if there is obviously incorrect information think what kind of signal it sends to people.
another thing i noticed is that auxiliary takes about 200wh energy (even with no lights no ac, no blowers etc).
it would be fantastic if the 3600mah cells could boost the car's epa range to around 400 miles, but i'm sure it isn't a simple swap.
given the complexity involved, i would be happy if a real-world test fell within about 10% of the modeled result for energy usage and range.
there is also another company building a plant in kentucky called zap that will build a comparable vehicle to the chevy equinox or nissan rogue for about the same money.
only way to extend range over battery capacity is to bring energy to car from outside of the car using something like solar panels.
the 200-300 mile range of the tesla vehicles is very impressive, especially compared to the 50 mile ranges the other car companies are bragging about.
any consumer and also any commercial station.
breakpoint for bev to really become common car is about 600mile range with reasonable price.
also ev is just simply superior in efficiency and performance.
current tesla is using about 300w/h per mile with 70mph.
you gain more with just watching your power usage "driving easy".
tire losses are mainly determined by the weight of the vehicle and the rolling drag of the tires themselves.
at the neutral point, the electric motor freewheels and produces no drag and no thrust, just like declutching an ice (internal combustion engine).
timo standard household current here in the us is 15 amps / 110 volts i believe.
in this case it would extend your range, to almost unlimited or atleast daytime hours if you can't find 24hr locations that can perform the service, once a full network of locations is established (as long as the proceedure can be done by most service techs).
having battery swapping stations based on described common standards arranged together with car rental services near airports would expose many people to bev driving without forcing them to spend a lot of money for "scary new technology".
basically world do not have enough economic insentive either for fossil fuel economy or co2 pollution reduction.
but they could still brag, "we could have developed that!".
a small, 5 volt, portable generator system can be built for use with your cell phone.
the thing made me write now are the charts and the data provided by tesla.
anatoly, you said that battery ev:s are not race cars.
so, switching from a transportation system using 14 billion kwh worth of gasoline per day to all electric transports that uses 1/5 as much energy means it would use only 2.8 billion kwh per day - a much smaller increase in electrical energy demand.
it may have intellectual property value.
my experiments were consistently getting 6-10% worse results than expected and i was beginning to think there might be a problem with my car.
now i'm not a big fan of wheel motors, but if you are creative, you might be able to use one in the position where your ice is, or maybe with the axis vertical and a 90 deg drive.
use that power to those cars and you have much better kw for charging.
until rockets came along the propeller propelled aircraft community(aero engineers) felt the same way about thrust.
to get one 85kwh battery charged you need 85000wh/2.67wh/kg = 31835kg of those.
if you run a motor by itself, not mechanically connected to any outside mass, it won't budge at all.
nathanael, cold weather testing has been done, at temperatures far below 0.
although fc range is a little better than batteries (max about 400 miles) it is still limited compared to gasoline.
we (or at least i) would like to hear progress information about type s like we had for roadster.
i doubt it, based on the fact that industry still is not using anywhere near the same amount of power at night that it does during the day - many business turn off a large number of lights - computers are either shutdown or go into hibernate mode, etc.
which is where the electricity cost comes in, because that's a very power-intensive step.
there is a way out of this: to begin with, the vehicle could be built with four-wheel steering, as gm pickup trucks had, a few years ago, with their so-called "quadratrack".
some are trailers, an extra small engine, etc.
evonic are lithium manganese polymer as are chevy volts, tata's indica ev, kia, hyundai.
the parking lots have had plugs for block heaters for the gasoline cars so the blocks dont freeze in winter for many years.
it is also polluting tech, many times worse than ice -engine, at least until we have all power plants transformed to green energy sources.
it really would be nice if you could pull up to a ess swap station, go inside and pay for a battery swapout and come back out and drive away that would give the marketability a huge boost, range is always the complaint that people give as to why ev aren't feasible.
but looking at it more closely the roadster consumes 199wh per km or 5 meters /wh.
panosonic has 2.9ah batteries and just announced 3.1ah version.
one clear driving “tip” to take away from this is if you are ever nervous about making it to a given destination: you will do much better to slow down instead of speeding up.
okay, i'm no engineer, or electrical whiz.
that only brings down the drag by 5%.
the air pressure in the tires has a large effect on this rolling resistance, grip and the overall tire loss.
so for drivers in new jersey nothing would change since all the gas stations are still full service.
i think if engineers looked at the astm they could probably tell if it would work as i claim it would or they could point out the flaw in the concept.
so if you reduce total mass by 1% then you would reduce rolling loss by about 1%.
electronics mainly i believe.
i would also consider it wise for tesla not to brag too early and loudly about future batteries, and potential suppliers - not because these may not become avaiable, but simply to not alert competitors needlessly.
now if they somehow work to lower that to 200w/h per mile with 70mph that will mean increasing range to 270-280miles.
rachel; detroit auto workers have been rooned by gen'rashuns of union membership.
it is hard to see how extraction of all these elements would generate any dramatic amount of extra co2 pollution.
so, real energy density is significantly reduced.
ben ryan; 400% efficiency is just impossibility, it would make perpetual machine reality.
most customers of expensive sedans expect high performance, even if they don't use it.
as much as i'd like to see custom kits and other suggestions such as range extention that i've seen in various comment threads, there are other companies doing those things, most are not very good, and it would divert too many resources and focus away from tesla's critical success in getting real-world, ground-up, pure evs on the road.
the battery pack weighs almost 1000 lbs, and is designed to maintain performance for at least 160,000 miles.
and, in order to generate as much energy as car uses you would have to capture *entire airflow* car causes when it moves thru air and then some, because you wouldn't be capturing energy used to overcome rolling resistances and ancillary losses.
as you said nuclear is pretty clean environmentally, but solar and geothermal where it is available would be much better because those are clean and renewable (well geothermal isn't really renewable, but it has nearly unlimited supply, much like sun).brano andric have you guys thought of running the ac and radio of the solar panel that could be a part of the hood.
it could be good advertising for ev:s in general, mercedes-benz and tesla.
that is small enough that combined weight of battery + engine + transmission + controlling units + cooling takes less space and weights less than ice + transmission + gas tank.
while it won't provide 100% of the energy needed, it is a step in the right direction.
power consumption of an electric motor is determined by the power output, t*r, not just the torque only.
it might be that main benefit from this co-operation is that tesla is getting those batteries in discount prices.
one example they gave from their testing was generating 1kw average per shock on a 6-shock heavy truck.
under that conditions it is hard to see how prius could make better mileage.
so, some people may get a false sense of security when they notice improved forward traction due to 4 wheel power, and think they can stop more quickly.
in an 'ideal' world, the 'real' solution would be a 1000 battery range at highway speeds, eliminating the recharging part of the equation.
soon you can get battery packs with 500-700wh/kg energy densities, which means type s 300 mile 85kw battery pack times two (600 miles) would weight only 340-240 kg and take space about same as your current gas tank, and it is not stopping there.
you at least lost me right away as a buyer.
will be visiting back soon.
maybe litium-ion batteries win this race too.
i think lithium air cell is the best way to be adopted in future tesla car.
i guess they edited out the part of the clarity segment where they obtained hydrogen via hamster wheel-powered hydrolysis.
there's a draft white paper showing the most efficient method for building a full series hybrid vehicle of any type; check with me at the e-mail address that i used to register for the tesla web site.
gasoline cars in such a mode do not suffer that much because they have higher range in general and could be refueled rapidly.
no need to tow the car to charge it.
the increased drag would drain away more power than the wind turbine could produce, reducing the driving range.
workers at the station would be need and would ask the driver and passengers to wait in the store front of the station until there number is called or name or what ever system the station would use.
if you do that you also cut down money flow to middle-east and by side-effect cut down terrorist money sources.
in near future bettery energy density will be far raised resulting unnecessity of additional complex structure of engine generator.
roadster has 54 kwh battery so that means typical daily commute takes about 9kwh, lets say 10kwh.
to cruise at 60 mph takes about 15kw. however, if you double that to 30kw you will only accelerate to about 80mph -- far less than twice as fast.
i get 1.67 billion kwh.
however when the car is sitting on the road, if there were new solar cells on the roof say.
also applying constant torque does not mean that you get any further, it only means that force that accelerates tires and fights losses is constant, and you get maxed acceleration which still slows down when aerodynamic drag and rolling resistances start to climb up.
it does have one "gear" with very low energy consumption.
this generates 12.5 kw and weighs 24kg, which is not a huge amount of extra weight: http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/lucas-aerospace-generator-200v-400hz-12-5kw-gas-tu...
yet, if i want to take the family for a weekend get away to a major city three hours away, i'm not going to make it there and back on one charge.
because we have such an entrepreneurial and highly technical customer base, many of these experiments are quite detailed and attempt to answer questions that we have in some cases never discussed publicly.
sandie does paperwork even better then i do.
i have no use for two-seater toy car, no matter how "cool" it is.
worst case it will cool down in minutes no way a short can do serious damage unless a whole module is shorted out.
oh here don't have a good understanding of physics.
hello gentlemen; i love your work, i hope for a day i can afford your product.
a company called "project better place" is also designing an ev battery swap system, though i don't know if tesla is cooperating with pbp on it.
wayne p. bishop you wrote: "doesn’t that mean that, within the laws of physics, you can apply(not “change to” by gearing) the same torque at any rpm without needing more power" and answer is "yes".
because of this, they cause the energy usage per mile to start becoming high again at very low speeds.
that is at least my experience with cars (and i have driven a lot of different vehicles, including military ones).
but of course, most days you'd be driving less than 244 miles, so the cost would be less.
in our righteous zeal to save the world, we should avoid creating illusions.
gas equiv.)/5,119,100,000(barrels)=29.5 kwh/bbl, not 140kwh
also, how about forward motion or the engine's rotation rotating a generator head to keep a charge continuously.
since there isn't a gas tank on an electric car, miles per gallon is rather meaningless.
i browsed the internet, and found this interesting article on pm motors as used in wind turbines:http://people.clarkson.edu/~pillayp/c12.pdf.
when a low cost battery can take a car 800 miles on a charge, the whole world will go electric.
even that us electric grid is somewhat outdated it can handle increased load from ev:s. there was a conversation about that not so long ago here in tesla blogs.
that is whole day worth driving.
for more range you need bigger energy density, not power density.
like many here, i'd love to see a real-time moving bar of the total sales and/or deliveries on this site.
each individual motor would really need enough power for the whole vehicle, as i had described the system, not 1/3 that power, as i originally said.
we should prove that batteries can be made cheaply.
btw, there are already tow trucks being retro-fitted to carry generators to give a stranded motorist a charge wherever they get stuck.
so, the masses of the lithium metal cathode and other structure is not clarified in the news contents.
also steve was very knowledgeable about the car, and i do thank him for answering my questions and the whole fun filled experience.
tesla's battery charge is programmable so you can select maximum charge typically 85% to 95%.
if at any point the processes would become unsafe then the charger would stop power.
electricity is available pretty much everywhere, and if you have that kind of range you just plug it in when you are home and leave your garage every single day with full battery pack.
http://gas2.org/2008/10/13/lithium-counterpoint-no-shortage-for-electric... sounds like the silicon shortage for pv: not really a problem.
another idea is to use "powered guideways" that would isolate the vehicles from pedestrians and regular traffic, and fully automated to provide convenient, safe, rapid and efficient transportation between cities.
some of this is based on the chemistry of the batteries being used, and some battery types might survive better at colder temperatures than others.
leo of stuttgart: tesla motors is located near the coast range in california, and many of their test runs were running through those mountains.
one thing that tg didn't mention was that honda fcx costs several **milion** dollars just to produce (you can't buy one), so compared to that roadster is cheap car.
at home, you send back the battery pak to the stores, you receive your money back for the warranty.
for seven years savings would be 12000€. looking good this far.
hydrogen transport/storage infrastructure doesn't exist.
too low power and too low frequency to be even close to even mildly dangerous levels.
to increase that by 25% to 300 miles would mean driving about 45 mph.
second, the connection between low frequency electromagnetic radiation (ac waves, radio, microwaves, infrared) and cancer was based on a single study finding slightly higher leukemia rates in residents living under power lines, but it did not measure actual exposure to electromagnetic radiation.
may be more efficient solution will be to have hub motors in each wheel or in 2 of the wheels.
when the car leveled out, those generators would be electronicly turned off, and they would be in free spin mode, creating little or no drag on the battery system, other than the actual weight difference of the casing of the aluminum generators, and windings.
you just have to use your brain a bit and get your brain off off hydrocarbons (gasoline).timo 1:26pm | jul 7, 2009 ken, 10000 miles without stopping at 80mph is just impossibility.
i feel that with my pdivt ( positive drive infinitely variable transmission ) concept i could probably get away without needing a prototype for the engineers, when they see it to say "i see, i think you've got something here!".
same with those wind turbines, they increase wind resistance equal amount of the electricity generated and then some, which means *you both* are suggesting lesser range.
i would imagine the higher the speed the lower the draw on the battery.
there also is no hydrogen stations, while you can recharhge your roadster at home or from any outlet out there.
it had a 600 amp service.
you know that would be worth a billion$ right there.
some batteries can be recharged in just few minutes, so it only depends how high in voltages and amps you can go safely to make battery recharging fast.
problem with your transmission claim is that you are claiming that you can do that with transmission which does not apply any power source like those rockets in your example.
b] you mentioned headlights being a large 12v load.
most people i don't think have a clue where the power they use comes from coal, hydro,nuk,etc., if we were using water to make all our electricity (which is the cheapest energy available) this would be a good thing but more electric cars need more power in the grid and we are right now pretty tight in the wires on the ground.
some mit scientists figured out the 3d simulation for fluids which can bring to new inventions that reduce aerodinamic drag.
for typical office day you can then charge 36kwh in your car (worth maybe 100 miles) and rest of the day you can sell that electricity to the grid.
they initially stated that the plant that is making them could make 250,000 per year.
and if that is not fast enough then there might be higher wattage connection closeby in some restaurant or something like that.
it is an interim crutch till charging station catch on.
because you already have solar panels in your home it would be wiser to plant those panels there instead.
i have change the hub motor for 1000w high performace motor, through out the weight (lead batteries) replace with 1 pack of 16 = 48 x 3 of lifepo4 batteries = half the weight of the lead batteries.
that is such a small price to pay that it is hardly even a factor in my decision making process.
however we can see a lot of new ev vehicles released in the next 2-5 years (may be hundreds).
i think that every 200 miles of driving you pull over and re-charge for 5 minutes is faster then we are now with gas engines.
yes and no, because charging stations are not even needed ever for 90+% of people driving bev.
they couldn't imagine constant thrust at any speed - jets.
in only 200 years, we have completely reversed that gradual climate change and put the world on a sharply increasing temperature trend by greatly increasing the co2 and other greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere.
about healing diseases using electric fields, those are just placebo-effects, nothing real is happening.
i'm assuming the motors can be manufactured to run both clock-wise and counter clock-wise directions.
it is small and can move a heavy load.
most of the braking energy is consumed by the front wheels, so the energy recovered can be higher in a front wheel drive electric vehicle.
also, if the powers that be could include leaders of magnetic motor technology in their development, we might see ranges of more than 3000 miles without charging.
also because car is using quite a bit energy while driven it might be that those coils might not be viable source of energy.
another says 'the worst winter storm in the midwest in 25 years; another says ' it hasnt stopped snowing since december 29' and has a picture of snowfall burrying a gas guzzler.
ed 1:03pm | mrt 27, 2009 i have to admit, the model s is a stunning 4 door vehicle.
if not, then you would need to charge one time during your trip and once at back home (and for both cases once at destination).
takes 1h to recharge at power station, and costs $30 000.
of course in simulations charge-discharge cycles needed for 100000 miles have already been made.
engineers are often bombarded by folks who have a bright idea, but then they find it doesn't really work because they've overlooked some minor point - maybe too much friction, or a part that collides with another part, or the kinematics is wrong, or some other subtle error.
david e. manwell electric motors have a very high efficiency over a very wide speed range and power output.
http://www.eetimes.eu/germany/212500315 - alfred personally im gonna buy a tesla or at least a model s as soon as i can, but i was wondering if tesla is ever going to just sell parts, so that people could convert their old cars to be electric.
actually, after 8 month of exploitation i'am at a very good (better than previewed) 2400kw produced.
hub-motors otoh could save space and allow more interesting designs.
i know most people talk about 20 to 40, but i think it will happen much faster.
the theoretical energy density is 3.6 kwh / kg (while the practical estimations are 25% of this ).
getting get even more mileage would be made impossible by using that extra battery energy for extra acceleration.
electric energy is not free, and generator is just engine working another direction, so all electricity it generates slows car down until it does not move.
after all i believe this is the main point where people find out information about your cars.
one unit has dimensions of 762 x 425 x 265 mm (~0.085 m^3) so 850 of those is about 73 m^3 or about 2m*6m*6*m.
probably that cannot be done, but it would be very elegant.
even with batteries current prices you win compared to gas during car life cycle.
they don't have capacity loss over time, can release their energy more quickly, can be charged more quickly and so on...
i am concerned about the high rpms for the motor, most gas or diesel motors max out about 5-6000 rpms, would not 13.000 rpms wear out the motor parts faster what is the epected lifespan for a motor ?
however, composite may cost more, than current estimates using steel and plastics.
some of that is diesel fuel, heating oil, lubricants and other products.
i don't know tesla's price on the existing 2.2ah versions but guess at more than $2, so an upgrade would cost 6831 * $3 = $20498.
i think worst case would be to drive full throttle to the 125mph and then brake as hard as you can until car stops and repeat.
for safety reasons, i'm sure such technology would not be suitable for use on side or rear windows nor windshields, but the model s prototype features a sunroof that has a fair bit of real estate.
125 miles is about 70% of full battery capacity, so with home recharging unit that would be approx two and half hour to recharge, or 37kw with about 90% efficiency from just about any outlet (depends of voltages and amps you can get out from it).susan morrill i can't wait to own my tesla - i am planning on the family sedan model :)
it's with all the small things together that we can achieve big one.
on a typical drive with normal stops, 5kw would give you well over a 400 mile range.
i'd expect it is about what usual car would be, except that you will never have to repair or maintain your engine, and your brakes are saved quite a bit by regen braking.
basically what i mean is:- does the regen energy produced + distance travelled using this regen energy = distance that could be achieved by just freewheeling down a long hill.
i live in canada and am definitely excited about the developments happening at tesla.
we have developed a magnetic gearing and coupling system that works great.
but just in general i do not see that answers to all these questions are so certain and obvious that anyone could definitely exclude battery swapping as a potentially reasonable option for bev.
only pml has announced that they are making a production line for their hi-pa drives and this link http://www.hipadrive.com/faq.html says about 18 months (been there for almost a year).
timo 2:08am | mei 22, 2009 daimler has acquired 10% of tesla as everybody should now know.
pem is quite big object in roadster.
an electrical engineer can do the math on what the neodymium magnets spinning all the time can do for you.
you just take short (30-60min) break in driving and continue after eating or drinking cup of coffee.
you could stop for food and charge say 50kw connection for a hour at about every 400 miles (6.30 hour drive) and extend you range to 1000 miles, which gives you second hour stop at 800 miles which extends it further to 1200 miles.
that gives you about 190-160 mile range.
oops, i forgot that nobody seems to have the necessary curiosity to ask the right questions.
if the charging stations can be installed for $3000 each (parts and labor) then you can have 2000 of them for the same $6 million.
would love to see your vehicles make it up here.
the tesla roadster already has a way of converting forward motion into electricity by converting the drive motor into an alternator.
come hell or high water, my next car will be all electric.watzabatza wow!
it wouldn't require a large number of locations, it would mostly be for travelers.
the bbc is a public service broadcaster and not tied to sponsors in any way so tends to be trusted more than a commercially funded broadcaster.
solar cars that get good speed and and range need huge flat table-top collectors on the roof, and are designed to run on bicycle wheels with minimal body structure and weight.
it was simply too abundant and cheap until lithium batteries emerged.
from sun, from computer next to you and from monitor in front of you, from your laptop, or your neighbor laptop, cars and metro and trams, aeroplane induction etc. etc.
the battery has enough energy to keep the cabin warm for more than a day, even at -16, and it has been tested at colder temperatures than that.
my guess is that it would be similar to solar panels: not useful amount.
timo 4:21am | mei 22, 2009 joshua maxwell; i would use flywheels for high life span.
it seems that roadster would have faster acceleration than what they are using now, but lower top speed.
in fact i probably get to work faster *walking* than with a car (about 25 min walking distance) if you count time from door to door.
all of our american automotive models could be "all electric" right now with the astm propulsion system.
you need something with little bit more off-road capability.
you have more time to react and get control back.
you have 500+ billion military budged.
there just is no point using fuel cell car when battery tech is showing near future advances of approx 1kwh/kg energy densities.
he sawed off a vw rabbit at the firewall and towed the front wheel drive ice and transmission package behind the 944 as a 'pusher' .
with _average_ 60mph (which will almost never realize) that is 13 hour drive.
it indicates the need for only 2.8 billion kwh per day of additional energy off the present 10.5 billion kwh per day grid.
more torque, less noise and heat.
the charts above shows a speed of about 55 mph for the 244 mile epa rated speed on the roadster (note the official epa range rating was made using a "drive cycle" with varying speeds).
something like typical sedan has somewhere around 10m^2 area facing sun at midday at the equator.
i have messaged and emailed a number of ivt and cvt manufactures recently.
recent news from japanese research organization( aist) is very interesting to me.
the "long tailpipe" is very much true for hydrogen fuel cells.
i eliminates the differential, single speed transmission etc.
you should definitely have compatible system with them for europe models.
so lets start with lets say 15w electric engine that runs with high torque and low rpm.
tesla motors didn't consider it worth the additional cost.
second layer of safety would be the charger it self .
i don't mind having that screen, i just don't like the idea that it replaces all ordinary center console controls.
reaches about 200miles on the highway and about 300miles in the city.
this company is exactly what the america needs.
i do still laugh whenever i see a 40 or 50 mile electric range being mentioned in the specs for the electric hybrids that all the major car companies are announcing and developing now... ha!!!
having a working model that you can show makes a better impression on the engineers you are trying to reach, even if it is a simple plywood and plastic model, or just something cobbled up from cardboard and string.
i long to see all of us working people using electric bikes someday breathing better air.
europositron claims that they have invented one, but that is very likely to be just a scam to collect money.
they have built in regulators and most are shaped like a regular car battery.
if we would switch to alloy holders and stack the discs, we could easily increase the power transmitted.
depleted battery packs could go to a recharging center powered by solar and/or wind energy.
all the marketing hype in the world will not sustain any product when customers discover its short comings.
timo 11:47am | dec 29, 2008 elliot boyle, those toshiba batteries have very poor energy density, so they would be useless to electric cars, but batteries do advance and fast.
i think it is important to prevent spreading myths among consumers that driving an electric car is somehow more righteous than driving a conventional car, simply because it doesn't have a tailpipe.
you can also take advantage of the latest electronics, and use for example ulv processors and parts for the computers.
in going home downhill this potential energy can be tapped to charge the battery to recoup a portion of the energy used to provide the potential energy gotten by going uphill to work.
you wont get much bigger drag with bigger car as long as it is aerodynamically shaped.
that’s why i suggest the all-electric power train to exploit this torque curve.
daniel: aero drag; maybe car skins should take a page from the new swim suits that use fine grooves the length of the body ("shark skin").
it is also important to note that, because the loss is not linear with air speed over the car, you cannot “zero out” the effect of wind by driving in a closed loop course the way you can with elevation changes.
for this point 3 i need to point out that current thinking of "drive to station to fill up/charge cars" is nearly non-existent in bev world.
in fact there is recent invention that allows charging batteries in few seconds (allowing 175kw/kg power density), fully charged battery in about five seconds.
kg power density 1800w/kg ---- not an improvement.
higher pressure gives lower rolling resistance but a harsher ride and degraded handling.
the power grid of this country is not going to get fixed by auto makers nor battery technology matter if you can’t charge it.
alternator you are proposing just turns kinetic energy to electric energy (with losses) , which is exact opposite what emotor is doing.
the tesla ev has a battery chain made with 6381 li-ion cells connected in series and parallel.
microsoft stays the onwer of the software and just lease some installation and use rights to cistomers paying money for that software.
these vehicles run on all electric till the batteries run low and then switch in an ice motor generator to provide electrical energy to drive the motors or recharge the battery.
we need to focus on the fact that oil might run out sooner than we think.
for the endurance racing fans... i thought it would be interesting to see how long you could drive (in hours) at a given constant speed.
you don't need to charge fully during long road trips (over 600 / day trip) if you can get about 200 miles in a hour, ie in your lunch break.
altairnano and a123 batteries have very high power density but not high energy density, so they are not very good for for large operating radius bev.
the safety about the electricity and about airbags or the braking system.
maybe in future we could have long-range fc/bev hybrids and shorter (600mile) range pure bev.timo 10:44pm | okt 1, 2009 i just stumbled upon popular mechanics site where mythbusters show why bev beats ice.
bruce: i imagine the air conditioning works very well.
student 12:50am | mei 12, 2009 this company will do much better in eu (or japan) than in usa because of smaller distances between cities and gasoline price.
current techs allow changing maybe 30% of that to electricity.
compare that with gasoline costs from 7 cents (hybrid) to 25 cents (guzzler) per mile, and the fuel cost savings are clear.
basically there might be a few fanatical tree huggers that would suffer with this piece of work so they can boast how small their footprint is.
buy a production tesla roadster and put your cool little device or mr. fusion machine and demonstrate how you can travel from nyc to la on a single charge.
it so simple i can't believe that smarter mind haven't figured it out.
that way, you will never have to stop for a recharge, and you can use a smaller capacity battery.
i look forward to seeing the exotic vehicles that will appear after we've fully converted to renewable sources of energy.
you could make the car have a 2000 mile range and people will still complain that they cant charge when they want to quickly.
(i like the gm marketing term better than the phev) because it's simply a win-win solution that automatically leads to ev's once batteries/supercaps can be charged quickly and once the infrastructure is in place.
if this were used in tesla roadsters, the roadsters could charge and discharge much faster, weigh incredibly less, and could handle more cycles of charge.
that is capacitor-class power density with battery energy density.
teg 4:11pm | jan 3, 2009 this document: http://www.ferdinand-motor.no/images/tesla/eurospec.pdf says: "motor 3-phase, 4-pole electric motor, 300+ bhp peak (225+kw)...
when you can charge over night and drive all day there will be no more need for gas or diesel vehicles.
in going to work you are gaining potential energy by going uphill.
the battery absorbs and release oxygen from the air during the discharge and charging process.
studs do help traction on ice, but, as you know, not on snow.
more efficient and less costly.
that means it would still have 447 miles left in the battery capacity.
much of the way from the summit down to sacramento you normally use brakes, in the roadster i wonder if you would end up with more of a charge by the time you reached sacramento than when you left the summit with.
the cells are 18 mm (0.71 in) in diameter and 65 mm (2.6 in) long (18650 form-factor); this type of lithium-ion cell is also found in most laptop computer batteries.
roadster has 244 mile range, so that is *still* about twice the roadster current battery tech.
unfortunately it was also pretty noisy which mean that anybody with ears could hear it coming from miles away and it generated lots of heat which made it very visible in heat seeing things even with camouflage, so emotor in that would have been excellent.
i don't know where that speed is but from jb's graphs above, its probably around 90 to 100 mph.
single gear transmission forces limited acceleration in cost of top speed or other way around, if we will ever get true ev racing car we need either huge rpm range for engine, or transmission that can cope with huge torque electric engine generates as well as huge jumps in rpm between gear changes.
jacob: the 16.8 kilowatt rate is the power limit a 240 volt 70 amp electric outlet can provide, it isn't the charge rate limit of the battery pack itself.
that's the cost from the utility, but about half my power comes from the solar panels on my roof.
roadster battery pack consist of roughly 7000 small batteries which combined gives 54kwh of power which gives 244 miles of range.
of course you could get huge range with huge battery, but that would also give you huge price-tag.
a better way to do this would be capacitor to battery charging.
it would mean much smaller motors could be used and still achieve adequate performance resulting in far greater range on far less battery storage.
you would only need pem, transmission and emotor that can handle around 1mw power and you can have 300km/h top speed using 14krpm single gear transmission without sacrificing acceleration.
timo; the nature article basically says that electric resistance and charge result from movement in a magnetic field, and that a way has been found to translate "spin" motion into em motion, hence into charge.
charging page says it can be charged with 480v so that gives roughly 94 amps.
charging 600 mile worth fast is not that simple task because of physical limitations.
you need also around two and a half - three gallons of diesel (if using that engine you linked) for full charge.
at 55 the tesla is going to do 70 mpg using that ice to produce the electricity and you wont have to stop, unless you drive over 65.
i understand that regen is quite effective charger.
we need to use block heaters here in winter, so every other park space has one "slow charger" already installed.
the only lights that would be necessary to have in non-led are the xenon headlights/bixenon.
the efficiency of evs is excelent.
usually in these high-tech products final product is even better, so i wouldn't be surprised if real capability is somewhere in 600-700wh/kg class.
just do 450/84 x 187 = 967 mi. range for equivalent weight of current tesla batteries.
like most hybrids on the road, the a/c is electrically powered and the compressor is completely sealed, making for a very reliable low maintenance system.
but i guess, with a little help, it could be done.
the only limit to a range extender would be set by its fuel supply.
contrary to popular belief - it is not the "battery storage" that needs to be increased to obtain greater range in "all electric" vehicles.
power 1--high power ... lower range for blasting down the road or getting out of a dangerous area.
so an electric car can just plug into the plugs already available in every parking lot.
i we would consume 40% of what we do now we would be energy independent and would not need to import petroleum.
for me it could work out, i live in florida, don't drive too much and my car is always parked outside in the sun.
now, if you do it hard---popping the clutch, etc all the time, well your clutch will probably be the 1st to die---but the tranny isn't far behind.
with a three times the life span this would cover the slightly higher cost of capacitors.
sorry to tell you this, but you've over-estimated the amount of power a small wind turbine can produce, and under-estimated the aerodynamic drag it will produce.
now i know tesla is using gearbox with 1 gear (newest drivetrain).
such owners would have to own or rent an additional internal combustion vehicle to accommodate longer trips.
the details of this model are quite interesting and could be a whole separate blog, but for now let’s just use it as a tool to help us understand roadster efficiency and range.
cm 9:48pm | jan 17, 2009 timo, i'm not the one that is going to set up and run the battery swapping system, i'm just expanding on what others have planned, mainly project better place.
in my country (slovak republic) are evs on zero level.
not for safety, nor getting anywhere (as long as you stay on roads).
then the driver is on their way in a couple of minutes.
batteries would also have a similar loss due to their internal resistance.
with the price of $3 / watt you get $300k for those panels.
if those get price a lot down or energy density a lot up then i agree with you, but as it is now capacitors just aren't useful.
from there, with a universal joint at each end, would be that wheel’s axle.
if you are tripping over the 10,000 mile number then try for a lower number.
tesla motors is not considering compressed air engines, either, the energy density of compressed air is far less than the batteries tesla is using, and the efficiency is lower.
10 hours would give you about 50 miles worth of charge.
mika: while it is possible to use regenerative braking to recharge the battery while being towed, that would be a "last resort" solution due to the strain on equipment and reduction of fuel economy for the tow truck.
no matter how fast a rocket is moving the thrust(force applied) to the rocket is the same.
battery pack depends of how fast they get to mass-produce type s. if it is late, battery tech gets improved, if early then they go with a bit lesser techs.
if lithium air cell remains as a kind of fuel cell by only consuming the lithium metal, it is not practical for ev, it must be realized as a rechargeable battery.
i urge that you and some engineers use few days to go thru all data presented in this website and fix them.
this power supply is 480 x 600 x 1.73 = 498kw. evonic (daimler) batteries are far superior to toshiba's scib.
of the natural gas burned to make electricity, a substantial portion is made from oil, which makes the statement no only misleading, but false.
you would need to have always that latest design in battery swapping station _with_ all older designs too.
almost overnight (before the next primary) the u. s. auto industry would become the global leader in auto mfg., dependence on foreign oil would be a thing of the past, and our environmental "footprint" would be drastically reduced.
also the e1 is 500kg total with 270kg batteries.
that would require that batteries for all cars are similar and no new inventions in battery tech happens, which for now is just opposite.
roadster batteries are laptop cells.
$57k type s is still too expensive for just 300 miles.
if that really is the real energy density of those batteries and they are already in production we can have electric car revolution sooner than even i expected.
battery pack testing for the 230 and 300 options?carl 12:28pm | dec 14, 2009 @ willis, jb has already done this with his 944 pev conversion.
# lad wrote on december 20th, 2008 at 10:51 pm ## i see that your tire pressures are 30/40 front to back; what is the front to back weight ratio i have read that it is 35% front, 65% rear.
however, hydrogen can lose its single electron quite easily which leaves only proton, and that is then a lot smaller than full atom.
aston martin db9 costs nearly twice the roadster price.
in theory (not in real life) it could be possible to build electric engine that does not lose any torque at any rpm which would mean constant acceleration force at any speed.
only some sedans for transporting vip or some generals had two-wheel drive, but those were not really military vehicles.
give me my car now!"xavier 2:54am | okt 6, 2009 billb, gr, one solution may be, and i think many people will find that interresting, the possibiliti to connect an additional battery package for long run.
thanks for the info!ramon123 of course, although reducing speed reduces the effects of drag, etc, it also increases drive time, which increases hvac.
although the main problem of the battery cars is the range achievable, i think the bigger problem is the recharging.
with the car moving along in the special freeway lane, a large induction coil moving along close to the power cable or copper center rail, would charge the car.
it would need to have at least 400wh/kg potential to be realistic replacement.
that would make a huge difference to the heating demand.)
shorts in the dc-dc powers/diodes is the only real issue i see with the battery which would blow out the fuse for a whole module, hopefully that can be repaired easy ?
if tesla does this progressively, americans will adapt by buying their cars.
(at least if it is made clear that that pace car has tesla drivetrain).brian h 1:30am | aug 1, 2009 timo; agree about the touch screens.
i'd say that car is obsolete before it is even born.
gcjoe simone 8:15am | mei 4, 2009 "cm wrote on april 4th, 2009 at 11:56 pm joe simone: tesla is currently using a 54 kwh liion battery pack with a cobalt oxide cathode with higher energy density and a lower cost per kwh stored.
the ev graveyard is filled with high flying ev start ups, including gm's infamous ev1; they produced 1170 ev1's, and leased them.
a gasoline powered auto getting 25 miles per gallon with 37 kwh per gallon of gas yields 1.1 meters/wh.
i really wonder how frequent such trips are.
xavier, solar panels in cars are not very useful.
they could also be used to improve the handling at high speeds (like using adapted bose suspensions).
(and they will probably be able to drive the 120 miles with headlights, air-con, roof down, wrong tire pressure and in rush hour).
the battery pack is regulated when it is cold or hot to keep a specific range temperature.
tesla model s with four people on board would be more energy efficient than roadsters two even with only 75% range.
by adapting your best current vehicles to accept a tracked overhead mobile umbilical power feed cable capable of not only powering your ev, but also charging your batteries while you are attached to this overhead dollie lane built into the national freeway arteries.
honestly, you can plug in anywhere.
the other alternative is to increase the number of poles, which is what most wheel motor designs do.
you have to consider the logistics of how you replenish your charge after you exceed your vehicles range, since there are now no electrical recharging stations available.
my ivt is continually driven and easily infinitely varied while under heavy torque load.
maybe soon we will will start seeing some real world experiences posted in the blog.
some of the videos and non-tesla pictures i have seen show that those cars are in reality very nice.
we have here all kinds of vehicles, front-wheel, rear-wheel and awd.
true, it will not make you rich, but it will give the average working person a huge savings in transportation, stop him from poluting, and keep him healthy.
for simple example during 'stop start driving' there could be secondary charge systems as in super capacitors that recharge in 9 seconds and can recharge millions of times, and these capacitors could play a dual role of being recharged by regenerative braking and actually driving the car in stop start traffic and traffic jams.
supercapasitors you suggest have very poor energy density, so they are poor solution to capture energy, also practical shape car uses about 10-15kw power at 60mph just to fight air resistance, at 80mph that is much worse.
with regen turned off, you get no regen, but on the other hand the car coasts along and doesn't need more engine power to maintain speed.
if battery contains only 70% of its capacity after 50000 miles (based on faq) then that would approximate 40% or less capacity after seven years.
thousands of creative people tried to violate that law by some technical design but nobody get any sligtest success.
i would think using hub generators would be a great way to drive for "free" basically.
300 miles means around 80kwh battery and 10 minutes means 480kw connection.
she drives easily over 25000km / year which is over 15000 miles / year.
h you will need a power station to refill it up on the way.
instead they price them 4 times as much as a new gasoline car....
what most don't know is a lituim battery causes more pollution to the environment then gasoline.
there are no dumb engineers in either camp.
having several thousand recharge cycles would help to keep battery packs alive for decent time under such heavy recharging conditions.
don't know enough about the model s batteries.
as for range during aggressive driving, an ev performs exactly like a gas-powered car: if you rag on it, your mileage is worse.
if we want to get somewhere longer you can always rent a car or use a train.
would it be feasible if such generator is made mountable/portable so you mount it in the trunk or something when you go on a long trip.
-40 is slightly too much for batteries to cope.
the thing that impressed me most about that roadster was its fantastic get up and go.
this might be addessed on the site already, again i apologise if i am repeating information already offered.
rich colwell, one of the frustrating things is reading about all these great new developments, and finding out that non are actually available to individual users.
ford's focus ev will only have half the range of the base model s, and the other cars on the horizon, such as nissan's cube ev, won't have the same range either.
it would also be an international news story as well!!!
that is basically range extender that is in some car designs like volt.
they will only care about styling and utility.
so it is hard to see how this manufacturing difference could manage any game changing pollution or energy use.
this would be much better, and cheaper than battery stations everywhere, and would charge right off the grid as the car moves.
under all described conditions battery swapping appears to become become fairly routine operation and questions of battery pack design, age etc would be solved by the fact that battery pack is not the car driver property.
much more than whole humankind uses in a year.
according to the figures above, it would keep the roadster going at 55mph if the battery was completely dead.
at least, i would hope so, with such a short timeframe as well as the fact that the factory is already being built.
400 miles is only about six and half hour drive which is still desirable.
limn polymer would offer about 50% increase in range, longer life and lower price.
at 70mph air drag take more than half of the total power to drive the car.
even with using **only** coal to produce electricity and then drive ev with it would be cleaner than any gas engine car.
if your mind is going like mine does you already see the ups and downs.
of constant torque from the rockets is still there at any rpm and if you apply a 10 ft. lb. load on it at any rpm it will remain at steady state at that rpm no matter what mass is involved and if that rpm is a steady 1000 rpms with a 10 ft. lb. load you can gear it down with a 10-1 ratio and then you would now have a system at 100 rpm with 100 ft. lbs.
with a unique gearing system you may even be able to generate enough power with the wheel generators at relative speeds to deliver enough power , separate from battery power, to sustain drive indefinitely.
if the cost comes down and performance improves, that might change.
we’ve validated the model by testing at a reduced number of points -- enough to give us good confidence in the results.
transportation or "supply process" as you name it is obviously less polluting (electricity is transported by wire, wires do no pollute).
they are making those batteries for industry and ev:s.http://www.europeanbatteries.com/news tried to dig out _how_ high energy density batteries they will make, but there is no info.
otoh because batteries need _cooling_ when car is driven cool temperature might actually increase range (but that means that passengers would then freeze to death :-p).htof 4:40am | feb 4, 2009 formerly on long trips you used horses and when they were tired you changed them.
you would waste a lot of energy going from electrical to mechanical
no more accidents, 150 miles an hour, no insurance, no traffic lights, no age limit, no vehicle size requirment.
in all cases, no matter which tech you use, you need grid connection that can deliver enough power to charge all used batteries/flywheels/capacitors in a day.
towable batteries would ideally work with all major electric vehicles so theoretically they'd catch on pretty quick.
and no, you can't use the battery to drive the alternator to charge the battery.
typical li-ion batteries are rated at about 500 cycles, lithium manganese polymer 1000 to 2000, a123 claims their nano-phosphate battery lasts 8000 cycles.
on the track, they accelerate hard (which of course uses more energy than gradually accelerating, and far more than steady-speed driving, even at 120 mph.)
this difference characterises energy efficiensy improvement from regenerative braking.
i think it would be a commercially viable means of showing the carb officials the system's potential for interstate applications for both semi-trucks and passenger evs.
a new x-treme biking event utilising clean electric full suspension mountain bikes in california would sure help raise the awareness of ev potential in our younger generation.
i think that mercedes-benz (daimler) with this new contract with tesla would be also making bev instead of fcv.
so many car makers ruin their designs and then wonder why their popularity is short lived.
battery charging speed is really not limited by batteries, you can't fast charge 50+kwh battery pack very fast unless you have nuclear power plant at home.
as soon as point 4 is reached, no one will buy anything else.
because of this, they cause the energy usage per mile to start becoming high again at very low speeds.
this is assuming that speed is held constant (i.e. cruise control) at each point.
tesla cars already have a motor that can be reversed to act as a generator, restoring some charge to the batteries, but it slows the car down, as the energy comes from the momentum of the car.
other variations would hide the power supply in a guardrail alongside the road, or use electromagnet coils buried in the roadway to transfer power by induction, or even use a linear motor drive embedded in the road to propel the cars.
"ionic batteries could multiply battery life by 11" link to article here...
i was wondering if anyone thought of using a air ram to charge the car as it's being driven they are a safety feature in the airbus planes maybe it would be a way to increase the range of the car
- do not underestimate the fine points of power electronics.
mean while battery research continued and great advances have been made.
i imagine the overall package would probably be no better than a conventional gasoline setup, but this is only intended for emergencies or especially long journeys.
as far as the overheating problem with batteries that i have read about real or not , why not devlop a battery cooling technology .
much weight and space is freed up for battery and – well – the rest of the vehicle!
this is way to create a amount of energy that can bee used for peripherals like stereo, car lights, etc. or maybe even more.
make 60kwh battery pack that could deliver something like 80000hp (not a typo, (60kw / 180w)
bshumberger 5:07pm | jun 25, 2009 a gasoline engine drives the alternator through the use of a belt.
the gm volt will be using a smaller 16 kwh liion battery pack with a manganese spinel cathode, the energy density is a little lower and the cost per kwh stored is higher, but since the battery is a lot smaller the total cost is lower, but because it is smaller it must withstand 6 times more charging cycles to go the same distance as the tesla roadster, and it does.
this was just the thing i was looking for, as a racing fan i will use this information well.......
roadster battery system does have "ac" for batteries, so they wont get that cold as long as they have charge, but if you leave your car in that kind of temperature for several weeks without charging they would freeze, and then you would not be able to get anywhere.
also, understand that this system can replace a $12 billion nuclear reactor.
ja 3~ phase (400v / 16a) and there is not any yet, but they also informed me that, and now the important point: there is europe-wide standardisation for those going on, and they think that they get it done by the end of the year.
timo 11:15am | dec 29, 2008 dave fisher, tesla roadster does not burn oil.
it would be a very bad choice for an ev "range extender" generator, the air tank would be larger than the batteries but would hold less energy.
also cornering speed needs to be quite high (that's where difference between ordinary car and f1 car is most obvious).
if i could get some specs from tesla i could look into the feasibility of manufacturing a prototype magnetic gear box.
few years more and those look like relics from stone age.
if we take same 400wh/kg battery we get roughly 475-500 miles left after 100000 miles assuming loss is linear (which it probably isn't, but does it increase or decrease, article doesn't say).
wind and solar if we double it in five years, at >1 percent now on the grid, that will make it 2 percent , still not much on the grid from alts.,and all the political hype is all bs and lots people are making money selling the global warming bs.
if any of that time is spent parked, it could be used for a partial recharge.
i don't think these range worries are going to be all that bothersome once there are plenty of level 3 charging stations enroute.
i am in northern california; i am thinking one station along interstate 80 coming into west sacramento from sf.
high power density though.
therefor there is much more torque at the wheels than there is at the motor.
of course, in 30 years, electrics will be the best choice for everything.
i did write to them and suggest that they read some of the papers which prof ulf bossel has written on the subject of hydrogen as synthetic fuel.
city driving is slow.
so our drinking water is going for getting out oil we will just burn and cause more pollutants.. 3/
attempting to solve these problems with technology is very exciting.
that increases rolling resistance quite a bit and those yokohama low resistance tires would be hazardous to use on icy road.
sure it could be created a market to make different battery packs by different manufacturers according to standards like these.
now this gets a bit confusing: when you apply power to the motor (floor the accelerator or in your case fire the rockets) input power is constant and you get constant torque, but output energy is not constant and is increasing in the rotating wheel.
i also know that you get your batteries (maybe most of them) from the thai market.
also, if you could make the frame (the heaviest part of the care) be the battery, now there's an idea, two birds with one stone.
unfortunately this would also increase road maintenance costs a lot, and it brings up a question how to determine who charges his/her car and how much.
not many of us are willing to drive that long without stopping for food and sleep over.
85 vs 54 kwh is over 150% bigger battery pack and 300 vs 244 miles is only about 120% bigger range.
you can't get same output from car surface as you would from rooftop.
tesla has already put the new solution into production and has delivered over 700 roadsters to happy clients.
but was wondering how the performance would be impacted in the cold and in snow driving conditions.
previously tesla cars would have very slim chance to get there as pace-cars, but if you get tesla components fitted in mercedes as tesla/mercedes hybrid, it is much more possible.
however, despite the real advantages offered by the li-on batteries, what is to come in future battery production; speaking in more readily available materials, that will allow further range, lifespan, use, and development.
it might be that lithium ion -based batteries are not "savior of the future" after all.
on the other hand if it doesn't work it is just another idea for the bin.
presented range is steady state - no acceleration/deseleration cycles.
the replacement period is 7 years.
but with better batteries i believe things will change.
the generator you list is just the generator (mechanical -> electrical), not the gas turbine to drive it, fuel tank etc.
re-engineered battery material could lead to rapid recharging of many devices.
joey simon 3:17pm | okt 14, 2009 everything i have read on the tesla roadster is very impressive except the concept of the two speed transmission that could not stand up to the torque, and had to be locked into 2sd gear.
this could be very very helpfull in many case.
spec sheet says "battery replacement (price based on battery replacement 7 years after delivery of your roadster.
gas turbines are only efficient when run for at least 10x their heat up time.
it is also mentioned in ewolf website in performance - flashgizmo, and there "revolutionary battery technology".
if the government did want to follow through on this and end our dependence on foreign oil, reinstate the u. s. auto industry as the global leader, reduce green house gases and smog to a level of insignificance, and alternative energy a household necessity equaling the inception of personal computers; the technology is here, and the time is right.
electric power companies provide 3phase 480v power to millions of factories world wide and can easily do the same for charge stations.
i had one old 0.9 liter fiat engine that engine block was light enough for me to easily carry alone, much lighter than 60kg.
it is only matter of how fast you can "recharge" your car.
unfortunately cost of electric car batteries in current mareket and industry conditions certainly offset cost of gasoline per overall ifetime of the car as long as gasoline is less than $10 per gallon at least i guess.
then a driver would be swapping out a battery pack that still has some power left and may feel like some of the power they paid for is being wasted.
so topgear folks might actually get the 55 miles range they claim in real life by driving like described with a lot of turns and close to top speed.
the potential of this overhaed umbilical system to substantially reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and promote widescale use of ev cars and semi-trucks here in ca deserves serious consideration in my humble opinion timo.
even 350 mile epa range would be sufficient.
"yet, if i want to take the family for a weekend get away to a major city three hours away, i’m not going to make it there and back on one charge.
it is the car frontal area times cars drag coefficient that matters, and car frontal area doesn't actually get much bigger for aerodynamic five-seater than it does to two-seater.
i am assuming that the graphs posted are all at 0% grade.
in the configuration above, 1% equals about 30 lbs.
with 5kw that would take about 10 hours, with 20kw 2.5 hours.
prototype means anything between 250wh to 500wh batteries, so can't say what that means.
you only need to solve how to make 1000v connection safely.
drivetrain losses include those that the user doesn’t typically control: the efficiency of the motor controller, the motor itself, the gearbox and generally all losses in converting the dc electricity from the battery pack into useful torque at the wheels of the car.
funneling the air that comes though the front bumper would spin a small turbined that spins a generator, which would charge your li-ion cells.
sure as many people noticed if battery cost per capacity would drop say 3 - 4 times everything would change.
if the transmission is ratiod to 0 the wheels will slide.
well behaving then it really doesn't matter if it is 4wd or 2wd.
50 kilos for 11250 hp which is less weight than nitrodragster uses fuel in one 1/4 mile run.
new batteries with increased voltages can bring the distance more than 300 miles at highway speeds.
just read today that toshiba are setting up new plant to produce a new generation battery which seems to answer all the issues and drawbacks of your current set up.
if we cut automobile gasoline consumption by 40 % we do not address the other 54% (100-46) of the 60% imported petroleum products derived from the refining process.
if i buy a high-quality, expensive vehicle today, i have the reasonable expectation that it will last 20 years with basic maintenance - that has been my experience.
honda fcx clarity has only 240mile range before it needs refueling.
a bit further away are techs that can deliver over 1.5kwh/kg.
the only problem once that happens is how the roads would get fixed since there would no longer be people paying taxes for gasoline which is what is used to repair the roads now.
yes i think it is a good idea and should work, since tesla's motors are induction and not permanent magnet.
in all mechanical systems there is friction which converts mechanical energy into heat.
this time is often quoted as the time to bring new technology from lab to market, but in fact can vary widely.
i'd really, *really* like to see a "poor weather range" model.
seriously, a solar panel can also be used to avoid the battery to give power to cabin lights, 12v adaptor or just air blow system non?
iirc roadster got 12s time in 1/4 mile and end speed was somewhere near 120mph.
problem: costs more energy to overcome its addition to drag than it can generate.
you simply drive up the ramp which releases your discharged batteries and replaces it with a fully charged pack.
roy, i have read one article about type s having "prototype batteries".
towable batteries could fix a whole lot of irks people have about making the switch to electric-only.
at summer that would be pretty much same situation, only cooling.
but i think ther must a possibiltiv to bulid low cost cars so every one can drive a car withe elecktric motor
i think best way to "charge while driving" would be using inductive coils under pavement (another mit/intel invention allows wireless energy transfer up to 75% efficiency to one meter distance).
ralphg rd2, my understanding of the aerodynamics for the s will be far superior to that of the roadster.
lower rpms not only saves energy, which extends range, but as an added benefit reduces or even eliminates motor "whine".
i know that driving from reno to sacramento uses much less fuel than going from sacramento to reno because of the elevation difference.
roadster drivetrain is pretty much optimal for a sportcar with single high power engine (hub-motors are worse for high-power car).
however, a 300 mile range is still not adequate for someone, or a family, when on a trip.
that range allows car to be driven nearly all day, and then charging time doesn't matter so much because you charge at night.
are there any articles or trials using some type of cvt for better response, or is the extra loss just that more motion loss within the transmission to drain the batteries.
perhaps exchange it along the way (quicker and cheaper than a gas up).
two wheels and a rope can be used to make a “block and tackle” to lift objects that are too heavy for us to lift by ourselves.
maybe tesla has made tests with entire pack.
60ah/kg * 3.6v is 216wh/kg, so it would be better than roadster current about 170wh/kg battery.
there is no question that batteries are much more efficient, about 95% vs 50% for fuel cells.
car can't accept very huge volts and amps without converter, and with huge amps and volts that converter would be large.
now if we were to convert all gasoline consuming vehicles to battery operated vehicles we would need to draw another 14 billion kilowatt hours per day from the power grid or about 2.3 times more energy than we currently draw.
we might get electric luxury mb:s soon to compete against type s. that isn't necessarily bad thing, but it might be (for tesla, not for general public).
after reading some of the articles on the gm-volt website, it seems that gm is using the inefficient volt as a last-ditch effort to highlight potential failings of the pure bev.
this helps us understand how our cars will work and how to get the most out of driving them on the rare occasions when range is an issue.
only reason to stay in fossil fuels is that those are cheap.
even if we assume that only one tenth of that is lithium it is still 20 billion kg.
if you think in terms of large scale, an inductor, capacitor pair will resonate at a certain frequency and stores power while resonating.
one accuweather news weather report says 'the worst winter storm in 81 years'.
david e. manwell 1:17pm | sep 30, 2009 i'd like to revise an earlier blog of mine: on september 1st, 2009, i mentioned that: "wheels are temporarily turning at differing rates, (with) one wheel (the shorter-radiused, inner, and therefore slowest one) (providing) the power while the (other 3) coast.".
for next generation design, i think gm has it right with lithium manganese polymer batteries from lg chem.
additional juicing in the middle of driving could enhance range so would it be possible to print the film right on the exterior body parts?paul bland 12:41pm | mei 8, 2009 hi, as aerodynamic loses are such a factor at high speeds any idea how much drag is caused by wing mirrors?
even if this is not full power to them it can be a free parts.
type s looks more "slippery" than roadster, but is also bigger car.
i didn't think that the 300mi range was intended to mean highway driving, but apparently it may be.
because f1 race car top speed is way over 300km/h, and even average speeds can be over 200km/h pace car that goes only about 200km/h would look like snail in front of fighter jets.
anatoly moskalev 5:16pm | jan 7, 2009 about prius efficiensy : efficiensy increase in prius comes from regenerative braking - basically reuse of energy from brakes or from going downhill.
capacitor tech is not moving faster ahead than battery tech.
and what about telsa's statement that after 5 years or approx(50,000 miles) the battery pack loses 30% of its capacity.
with current battery tech advance rate it wont take long for that to happen.
that means that type s has about 12-13% bigger losses.
top gear's dishonesty lies in presenting a 16 hour charge as something you're simply stuck with.
since the "reaction mass" isn't accelerated like it is for a rocket, neither wheel motor nor car can maintain constant torque or thrust the way a rocket can.
capacitors are good a providing brief bursts of power, but their energy storage is very limited, far less than any battery.
their planned model s has no infernal combustion engine and no gas tank, which leaves room for luggage both in front and in back!
we will be able to deal with all of the paperwork to show how your car stands up.
all these problems make me think that in the future cars will be smaller, more compact and highly efficient.
the more fuel burnt the more energy is generated in the form of higher speed motion or increased kinetic energy.
you are right, the fact that it can not slip because it is positively driven and, "is what every engineer has been looking for," will make it a tremendous success among automotive manufactures.
are tesla aware of new battery technology from mit that allows a li-ion battery to be charged in 30 seconds as opposed to 6 mins for a "modern day" commercially available battery.
that would give you that 800 mile range with ~14 hour driving (14.20 to be exact).
what we need is the engine management memorising all of its driving data and downloading it to a central server so as to determine a true set of mean values.
the limited range of electric vehicles is still the biggest drawback for them.
it is safer that way.
perhaps a high tech affiliation is better than score years of experience making legacy products.
and so i wisch too see the world with out paying for pertol have a nice day.
if it works well, there are plenty of auto companies that would offer a lot of money for it.
brian h 8:19pm | okt 22, 2009 jet; that aluminum technology is a multi-step affair.
matthew-j; teslamotors will own and operate all outlets and service depots.
and i believe extreme fun too, especially if you consider that fitting roadster engine in that thing is not a big task.
very informative ... and appreciated.
it is only "mystical" because they don't know how to do it not because it is impossible.
older batteries that no longer performed well enough for automotive use might still have value as "load leveling" batteries for electrical utilities, and finally, at the end, would be recycled.
i hope that doesn't mean roadster has inaccurate speedometer which shows less speed than you are actually going.
perpetual machine would require 100% gain or more.
since my interest has be piqued, i would love to own one of these; i just have to wait until i can afford one.
i think the only way to get cancer from electrical radiation would be to sleep in hammock strung between super high voltage power lines.
honda has already brought out the first fc car on the market and others will follow from mercedes-benz and gm.
only when bevs can drive 500 miles on a charge and a substantial charge, say 50%, can be done during a lunch break, will people use bevs for long trips.
i wish you guys the best and i am sorry our on government is sabotaging your business bailing out the old school guys.
a more obvious solution is solar panels on every painted surface.
by using a standard modular design, they could work in lots of different models - a compact car might have just 1 or 2 modules, a midsize 3 or 4, a large suv or truck might have 6 or more.
im not sure if this would be good enough to keep a batery charged but it could help.
in an article about tesla gas electric venture they indicated the need for a different battery technology than the all electric.
as they do, both of each side’s wheels turn at the same speed, deploying 2 wheels, instead of only one, for power on that inside track.
nissan/renault has already committed to building the cars for them.
like s1 and s3 torque-speed characteristics.
the range extender unit would have to be powerful enough to take most of the load from the batteries and contain engine, generator, cooling system and fuel tank, yet compact and light enough to be easily removed and installed (some sort of hoist would be useful).
tesla has done a great job in demonstrating what an all electric vehicle (ev) can be.
it is really slick, and simple and different then any ivt or cvt in use or in development today.
christian would it make sense to put an alternator running off of the electric motor identical to the current gas engines to help generate electricity while on the move?phil johnson 11:36am | feb 19, 2009 i have read articles that say that maybe you, or someone who wants to set up a business off of your car, by setting up a station that will change out the batt.
well built ev's and incrediblt talented individuals.
wh kilo=10^3, mega=10^6, giga=10^9, tera=10^12, peta=10^15, exa=10^18 so that would be 4.176 exawatthours of sun radiation every day.
it seems the electric car was killed by the combined forces of big oil, detroit and deregulation, involving deceit and misleading marketing.
because normal three-phase is already about 400 volts that's not hard thing to do.
keep up the good work, wish i could help.
lets get optimistic and say 15 billion kg would be what we have.
constructive criticism is great, but too many good ideas and products are shot down by critics who miss the point and focus on negatives.
where?cm 9:57pm | jul 2, 2009 bshumberger, our attention was elsewhere, we were not deliberately ignoring you, and we don't mean any disrespect.
in press release tesla (elon musk) says that it is mainly interested about daimler battery tech.
as far as i know the car's top speed is not drag-limited.
gr 12:29pm | sep 28, 2009 i remember seeing an article that describe hydrogen 'filling stations' that used solar power to separate the hydrogen from water...
these never work because they fail to consider the machine's internal friction.
american driving speeds are likely representative of world-wide driving, approximately.
there are other ways like inductive coils into road and that sort of things, but they just are too expensive and can't be used everywhere.
i have heard they are common in alberta and the prairies.
as a guess, i would imagine total battery charging efficiency would be greatest at very low charge rates (1500 watts or less), due to not needing to run the car's air conditioning, as well as minimizing i squared r losses everywhere.
the energy comes from the continuous burning of rocket fuel.
you can use more effective led lights in future, you can use pv paint on the car for additional power from the sun.
you always lose some power to air and rolling resistances as well as ancillary systems.
but that's still much cheaper than paying for the hybrids.
there is no slipping under heavy torque because it is "directly" driven.
timo: the key to battery swapping is to have one company lease the batteries and run the swap stations - then they'd bw swapping their own batteries for their customers.
hmm i think i just described the recharge safety already built in the all tesla models and add an extra layer to the high voltage charging unit.
you still have losses which increase with speed and limited energy supply, which tells how far your car can go.
drivetrain losses include those that the user doesn’t typically control: the efficiency of the motor controller, the motor itself, the gearbox and generally all losses in converting the dc electricity from the battery pack into useful torque at the wheels of the car.
so for my needs, i would have to have a car that could travel that distance at highway speeds, while headlights, gps, and air conditioning or heating (and radar detector ;>) being used.
if you were to reduce your batteries by a factor of 10 or even 50 and using a hydrogen fuel cell to constantly recharge the batteries then not only would you have all the advantages of the honda but your car would also be massively lighter and would be competing with the very fastest cars on planet earth.
(this concept was successfully developed in private garages in balkans during a war, it pouffes chipper and safer than a regular gasoline module).
worse, it creates air drag, which is why wind turbines have to be mounted on sturdy towers.
if these questions have already been discuss don't hesitate to contact me and inform me of my wicked ways.
138%, i was being conservative when i said over 30% increase in range, your figure of 38% is more accurate.
mohamad zandkarimi 7:14pm | jul 23, 2009 i work along side this company and not but pure professionals!
that means that any vehicle mush have it's energy supply replenished from another source, such as liquid fuels or electrical recharging.
as you surmise, regeneration isn't generally as efficient as just letting kinetic energy build up through speed.
mrclean 10:27am | mei 10, 2009 i wonder how much range improvement you could achieve by adopting solar cells on the surfaces, and in particular by fitting the car with energy recovering suspensions (from induction coils) from the continuous up and down movement while driving.
you can expect about a +/- 10wh/mile variation with a +/- 20% variation in tire pressure.
we talk about peak oil.
the astm can apply a low rpm torque to a higher rpm system(wheels) as if it were "standing still".
this can quickly become a huge amount of testing as there are so many variables and conditions, but fortunately we have spent quite a bit of time internally building a very accurate computer model of how the roadster will behave under different driving scenarios.
that looked like a lot of fun, and that would be just what you mean by two-seater with driver and passenger sitting not side by side but in line.
for those unfamiliar with the batery management system, it makes sure all the cells in the battery are equally charged during charging and prevents over charging which would destroy the cells.
does the electrics work in any conditions or does it has any max cold temp george, not all canadian parking lots have outlets.
keep the recharging at home and hopefully the range is enough for you.
it feels like very pronounced engine braking, like when you wind out a gas-powered car in a low gear, and then back off the throttle: i would very much like to see a driver-adjustable "engine-braking" regen setting for the model-s. set it high for performance driving, low for regular driving.
so nothing prevents to set a standard of voltage, sustained power and peak power for a battery pack regardless with what flavor of li-ion or nimh battery chemistry is utilized.
glenn forslin i have a solar multipanel 900 watt charger that is just dc to dc, direct connection, not using the tesla ac charging box.
roadster uses 13-14kw at highway speeds.
energy density can be estimated from data in this website (battery pack total weight: 450kg, capacity 54kwh).
it has some interesting design features.
i would expect that any battery lease would include provisions for free replacement of any battery that falls below certain performance standards, and batteries that no longer had sufficient capacity for auto use would still have enough capacity for utilities to use for load leveling and backup power, extending their useful lifespan.
in the real world, i suspect such problem situations are fairly rare.
it seem that the rear suspension may have had its bolts torqued incorrectly.
my max has 143k on it and i the past few years i have taken maybe 4 trips longer than 200 miles in it.
finally; our government would be focusing their attention (and our money) on a solution to a critical problem our nation faces, which would actually benefit the people who put them in office.
the coolant pump draws 146 watts.[63][64][65][15][66] a full recharge of the battery system requires 3½ hours using the high power connector which supplies 70 amp, 240 volt electricity; in practice, recharge cycles usually start from a partially charged state and require less time.
store pure aluminum in a protective solution with gallium, then add water which is broken down by aluminum's aggressive affinity for oxygen, releasing the hyrdrogen, which is then run through a fuel cell which generates the electricity, which would have to be "buffered" in some kind of instantly variable storage to allow for acceleration, etc.
it is obvious that the wind pushing against the front of the vehicle should be put to use.
once more, i, for one, lust for a couple of your cars, a roadster and the type s...
that would explain your link describing the 180 kg batteries (i.e. two 90 kg batteries installed).
for example the charts show it is possible to gain efficiency at every point on the chart and the battery would only be needed during acceleration times.
yes, it depend also of purchase price and total costs of opperation, but my next car will be "some electric."
this is because i want to study this field after graduate school.
in fact too slow pace car is dangerous to f1 cars, because they need speed to keep tire and brake temperatures high enough.
a recent article from mit, if this is true , ( see link bellow) it will change everything with your recharging of your battery packs.
higher pressure gives lower rolling resistance but a harsher ride and degraded handling.
for alfred, even if tesla gets those batteries, daimler is probably first major car maker to benefit from them, not tesla.
has there been any new designs that enables the vehicle to make and run off its own power with out recharging from an outlet?cm 3:27pm | jan 31, 2010 olda, the roadster has an electric heater and electrically warmed seats.
since there is no gasoline motor in the tesla to drive the alternator, you'll have to rely on hamsters in rotation cages.
$20k is a lot of money, but since we are talking about a $120k car...
cablechewer 9:02pm | jan 18, 2010 mika, even if that works i doubt the tow truck driver would be impressed with what you are doing to their fuel economy.
they are not robust enough for real world demands.tomthemd 11:03am | aug 2, 2009 to timo i strongly disagree with you on the large touchscreen.
however i like type s design much more than roadster.
fact: the technology exists now.
--- so electric cars apparently could dramatically reduce fossil fuel usage and co2 pollution.
" this assumes there is a means of charging available.
the "sqeeky wheel" timo pietilä brian, just to elaborate a little on timo's remarks about the battery.
you are at the hotel, knowing that you go back to home in 3 days... ups or fedex bring you your additional battery pack, you pay with visa for the rent and warranty and you can go home.
this could be a long (length) generating system that would use the movement of the wheels to generate electricity; feed to the main batteries, and if need be you could also generate electricity off the front wheels around the disc brake system.
a bit of good old down to earth analysis.
you can do the same thing with the drive motor.
finland is at winter quite cold place (depends of where you live it can get -20 to -40 celcius), so we use block heaters in our cars.
excessive use of cell phones causing cancer is probably not caused by radio-frequency em radiation, but more direct heating of your ear from holding phone next to your ear for prolonged time (i know my phone heats up pretty much and holding it against my ear would heat up my ear too).
the small overhead dollie would track and pace the ev below, capable of emergency disconnect via signal or tension on the umbilical tether reel above on the dollie.
cheap thin film solar cells give maybe 10% efficiency in converting it to electricity.
many purchasers of the roadster are also buying the solar panel kit that is available and - over the course of a year - that will mean that they will purchase no electricity (for charging the vehicle).
if so i can readily see how the could be a sticking point.
speed' curve again; maximum efficiency is at ~18 m.p.h., but at american average speed of 11 m.p.h.
as timo pointed out, they are less efficient than pure electric.
same with range which is said to be over 400 km there.
interesting point about a gas turbine hybrid.
sony just released them and are using them as of this month, and they can regularly charge 99% of their energy in 30 minutes, and last 4 times as long (reportedly).
there is, of course a speed where the air drag losses exceed the losses of regeneration.
timo 12:00pm | aug 25, 2009 jeremy lansman: hub-motors are weaker than out of wheel ordinary motor just because they are restricted in design and size in order to fit into wheel.
if i could simply plug the charging station into a standard 220 outlet on a 100 amp breaker, it would simplify things.
voltage used determines which way current is flowing, so you can drain one battery dry while other is recharging until voltage drops below charging.
but consider the following aspects: - tesla has wisely remained independent from suppliers of cells and can source freely.
but ev has inherent advantage of steady high torwue without gear switching.
if the generator is powered by the wheels, then you have regenerative braking, which tesla is already using.
some have already said that they are actually selling power back to the electric companies.
probably 50-60 pounds at most can be considered portable http://autospeed.com/cms/title_little-diesels/a_109062/article.html i think its feasible to produce a 10-15 kw diesel engine using cutting edge technologies and make it so small to be portable.
another 10% from the bumps in the road straight into your battery (tested on a hummer assuming more suspension travel from bigger bumps possibly).
the details of this model are quite interesting and could be a whole separate blog, but for now let’s just use it as a tool to help us understand roadster efficiency and range.
model s cd looks better, but it is bigger car so a is bigger), but efficiency question has been answered pretty thoroughly in this blog.
that would have quite a bit marketing power.
and a side note: i was surprised to read your design uses electricity for cabin heat.
it is already getting cold.
based on text it uses li-tec cerio batteries, and li-tec has partnership with daimler (http://www.li-tec.de/en/company.html) .
you did also earlier talk about "relatively scare raw materials" in batteries.
lets see, i could buy a chevy volt or a tesla model s...let me think about that for about a 1/2 sec.
if done right, it might be able to make the car run indefinitely by having the steam engine power the car and charge the batteries.
second: it costs a lot of money to build and maintain such infrastructure.
timo 4:32pm | jan 15, 2010 brian h., george; in good conditions sun radiation is about 1000w / m^2 .
also batteries have that same high efficiency.
meaning, it's capped electronically and therefore you can consume a lot more power per mile for max acceleration than you will with max speed.
i'm wondering why someone has not developed a hybrid that uses hydrogen fuel cells as the other half of the hybrid, instead of a gasoline engine.
ordinary sand is mostly silicon).
hybrids like the volt do generate electricity to charge the battery while the electric motor draws power.
it might have lower cda than roadster but not much lower.
4wd car tends to lose grip in all wheels at once, and getting back to control is much harder than with two-wheel drive car that gradually loses grip in front or in back first.
we all know that the typical family doesn't exceed it's 150 miles a day often but the risk of running out of juice effects us on an almost primitive level.
one gallon of gasoline contains 37kilowatt hours of energy.
as you said, or know, the rockets will always apply the same thrust(and therefore torque) to the wheel regardless of it's rpm.
what is important is that consumer products like the tesla are successful, because consumer demand is what's going to drive the r&d. here's an interesting article on "nanoball" batteries that are attempting to combine the quick charging benefits of a cap in to a battery.
the team did not like it however because as your own site states: 3.5 hours recharge time from flat.
doing usual car paint job isn't cheap, and if you have solar panels in it it would be several times higher.
tesla roadster has about 450kg battery pack.
i think the smaller figure) of course this is just vision at this point, i don't think they have even prototype build yet, so those figures can and will change.
it's almost as simple as building an upside down elevated hot wheels slot car track, then hanging retractable power feeds from them and plugging it into your ev below it.
e.v's are getting there and the i.c.e car manufacturers are worried and so they should be!
jb- from one engineer to another - thanks, very concise presentation of the data.
if we assume six useful hours worth of sunshine in usual workday at parking you gain 4.2 mile worth charge / day.
that would give you another few miles at nighttime.
we need to show the public that clean new ev technology is superior to yesterday's polluting relics in every sense, faster, lighter, better handling and quieter.
especially in some harvesters or somesuch that could have wheels in movable hydraulic arms.
this is proportional to speed due to spinning losses in the gearbox and motor and also proportional to power output due to conversion losses in the various subsystems.
they also brake very hard, likely hard enough that regen is maxed and they're using friction brakes, so energy is wasted there.
they pollute only on those rare long trips.
i think it is wise of tesla not to compete directly with the major manufacturers in terms of hybrids or fc's.
future is large range pure ev with fast chargers distributed here and there for those that need it in long road trips.
a car sized solar panel would produce just enough power to run a cooling fan, not enough power to justify the high cost.
and just by inertia and aerodynamic drag it causes it would make driving quite hard which makes it less safe.
the volt and other plug in hybrids are talking of a range of about 40 miles after which the internal combustion engine kicks in, and they are burdened with the extra weigh of that engine a generator and a gas tank.
otherwise, you sound quite right that “the motor would have to be mounted near the wheel itself” on the suspended mass of the vehicle, but just not in the (unsuspended) wheel.
this is an excellent read and a great website.
certainly, as technology and scale of economy comes into play, the cost will come down; but it seems the biggest factor in future development remains the materials required to produce batteries.
that open wheel formula-one style single-seater is bound to have much lower aerodynamic drag.
thomas i wonder if it would be possible and feasible to add solar paneling to the roofs windows on the tesla model s.
what _does_ increase is rolling resistance, but that has more to do with weight than with size.
this is assuming that speed is held constant (i.e. cruise control) at each point.
many customers, potential customers and curious observers want the details behind this average and how results may change depending on conditions.
capacitor technology is moving ahead faster than battery tech and should be looked at for recharge stations.
multiple studies that measured actual exposure to low frequency electromagnetic radiation found no correlation between exposure and cancer risk, so it seems likely that something else about that particular area under the power lines was causing the leukemia, perhaps related to the local environment or lower income.
if it's going to take longer to swap a battery pack including drive time than it does to charge at home and be more expensive too, i agree that charging is better, for the commuter anyway at the present time.
in one year, considering the arrival of autumn and winter, will i generate approx 3000kw.
the goal of electric cars should be to produce vehicles that are light and efficient enough for city driving *and* long, fast trips.
this would be legally similar to how people use microsoft software under windows.
for thelatest powertrain configuration (powertrain 1.5), we have demonstrated dynamometer test results of 244 miles range in a complicated combination of highway and city drive cycles defined by the epa.
in every about 5000 miles and average cost of maintenance is about $200 more than bev you get $4000.
tesla licensed a charging technology from ac propulsion that uses some of the motor control circuitry for charge controlling, so obviously it can't be driven while plugged in.
other than the potential for a slow drain of the battery none of this is any worse than my existing diesel powered car - in fact it might even be better because my diesel fuel is in danger of gelling at only -23c (exact temperature where gelling starts depends on the fuel & additive mix).george 11:54pm | jan 7, 2010 you may find this boring
we check the employment site often, and are very interested/pleased with your manufacturing success........... we remain - stuck in michigan for now.
that also means that charging stations wont generate income unless they deliver some other service like restaurant.
i like very much not having to go to the gas pump as often.
at least not before someone can prove to me that it is viable system marketwise in long term (meaning 10 or more years).
although the german brands built very effective motors and (expensive) features like using brake energy for electricity, led for headlights, start-stop engine and so on, but alternative drive can hardly be found.
the news is telling that improved lithium air cell have been invented at aist of which energy density realized up to 50,000 mah/g.
to all that suggest wind generators to get indefinite range, just try it yourself.
that can let you reach competitive (maybe more than competitive) pricing earlier in its ramp-up of production.
480v / 200 a would give you 96kwh worth in a hour or about 300 miles more.
i like the speed of a battery swap station, but i am not sure i want to give up my battery in exchange for one that is "in the system".
the total energy the roadster battery stores is 53 kilowatt-hours, but the peak power output of that battery is over 185 kilowatts!
tesla is just first in market, soon there will many many more.
f=ma, which gives a=f/m, only that in torque f is now force that causes change in angular velocity which depends of radius of the rotating object.
if you have an on board generator you effectively have a hybrid.
total battery pack weighs over 450kg so packaging and electronics is about 150kg not the 50 kg you assumed.
i am also unaware how many recharging cycles have been is established in the news contents.
there must be some error in that article, last time i read about lithium-air batteries theoretical max for them was 11kwh/kg.
how they sell those prius's to anyone i don't know.... especially when you consider the amount of damage they do to the environment when they are made.
luckily with high capacity car batteries charging stations don't get many customers during one day that charge their cars.
since i focus on using solar pv to power our evs, knowing kwh/mi (or mpk) achievable, is sure helpful in translating from kwh produced daily/ after losses.
it would be much harder to make adjustments to for example cd-player volume or cabin temperature setting if you don't even know what the setting is or where it is.
that's enough to give it 0-60 in less than four second acceleration and 125mph top speed.
the roadster uses 2.2ah batteries, simply because thery are cheap (i hassen to add that teslay buys the highest quality for reliability).
this means that when you let off the pedal, it goes to a neutral point and if you let it off even more, regen kicks in.
it has a huge collection of mostly sound technical comments.
the car owner would lease the battery from the "swap company", and when needed would just swap one leased battery for another, charged only for a "swap fee" and the charge of electricity, and credited with any remaining charge in the old battery.
and, if you think to apply on a car the bicolor style like this: http://wallpapers.dpiq.org/it_17__lancia_thesis_bicolore,_2004.html you can have about 5 square meters of photovoltaic moduls on tesla roadster model.
we build houses so maybe not for a while.
with reference to this post: jason m. hendler wrote on december 24th, 2008 at 11:55 am "when electricity is cheap, clean and abundant, and when batteries / capacitors / hydrogen is/are cheap, light, small and rapidly rechargeable, no one will care about efficiency.
some types of batteries can handle higher power than others, thus can be charged more quickly (assuming higher power is available).
that means being able to switch regen off/on..
i'm hoping tesla would be interested in helping with a proto type, or at a minimum selling me the needed componants, remembering this is a prototype for your bennifit, and we do not have millions.
from jb's website: http://www.jstraubel.com/evpusher/evpusher2.htmdavid e. manwell 9:49am | dec 19, 2009 i just noticed that the tesla model “s” (the sedan) has a 0-60 mph acceleration time of 5.6 seconds.
i'm not working for tesla, i'm just fan of the car and the consept.
a 100w light blub running for 1 hour will use 100 wh of electricity.
if you want "ecological" transportation use electric train.
you would get many miles more from that arrangement.
cm 11:28pm | apr 21, 2009 andrew may: wheels don't produce energy, but they can be connected to a generator that converts the forward momentum of the car into electricity, slowing the car down.
", the shorter-radiused, inner trailing, and therefore slowest one, providing all the torque to accelerate or even just maintain speed, " ... while the (other 3) coast.".
to me a design plus would be easy to change dc-dc powers and fuses for the module packs without having to dissect the whole pack.
anatoly moskalev 6:03pm | jan 16, 2009 about battery swapping : in the consumer electronics we could see something like video compression standards for example common for all the products.
about battery cost: at $12,000 per 100,000 mile pack, that's $0.12/mile, which is indeed quite a bit.
cablechewer 3:33pm | dec 23, 2009 herb, tesla has expressed no interest in building hybrids.
recycling the batteries has already been arranged.http://www.teslamotors.com/blog4/?p=66 3.
however solar panels are quite poor source to energy: roof covered with one would give something like 100-400w power, which is about 1-2% range extension and they are expensive.
less drag and light construct means much lower wh / km, which means it could use smaller batteries for same range which makes it cheaper.
perhaps a better measure for operating cost comparison might be miles per dollar (mpd).
if you park your car in parking slot in a sunny day you might even get 10% more range in ten hours.
at 300 miles of range and 1 hour recharge times, driving an ev on a trip won't be significantly more inconvenient than traveling via ice.
maybe each motor could be strong enough for 1/3 of the whole car’s power needs, to hedge against one motor’s failure.
10 hours of driving in 60 mph average speed.
in that case you bev would be stored without battery pack reducing fee for keeping that pack inside without use etc.
re: newcast on federal money for alternative vehicles and not getting approval to break ground in the valley, i have to say this: nice as it would be to keep jobs in california, there's a whole industry going under in the motor city, with workers, their families, children in school, etc and no jobs.
a cost, or donation basis would be fine, like a "rebuild".
i hear that one problem the prius has is rusty brake rotors; driven gently, the car virtually never uses its brakes to stop.
unlike a gasoline engine, reducing the power output of the electric motor would get only a little improvement in efficiency and range.
each of these loss components has very different characteristics and is affected in different ways by making real world changes to the vehicle.
in the winter and having your car stop in between two towns is not a great way to start your day.
i have another vision for them and would like to know what you think.
however, you can use solar panels at your home.
until an energy perpetual motion machine is invented, we should obsess ourselves with energy efficiency, in both the local and global context.
it only needs to run at one speed, with no worries about the torque curve.
any roadside restaurant already has capability to charge bev, all you need is to build connector for car.
snow often accumulates before it can be removed from the road, especially in rural areas.
i believe you could develop a self powering automobile.
that means that roadster would have to drag at least five meter high tether with it, and in tight situations (emergency brake, passing other car, need to evade something onto road etc.) forces that apply to that tether and connectors would be extreme.
because roadster is luxury car you can expect a bit higher cost for quality repairs, but quality would be excellent.
tesla would have energized the cars with these.
if i calculate correctly that means that you have there in us 1.5 billion cars.
excellent post for people to get their teeth into.
one of the most common and tricky experiments is testing how far the roadster will go on a single charge in various driving conditions.
so it is good to make sure that you are not “accidentally” carrying extra weight in the trunk or elsewhere if you are trying to get the best range possible.
first case shows directly how much power car is using per mile, so it is better determining how big battery pack you need for certain goal range, latter shows more directly how far you get with fixed size battery pack (assuming that multiplying is easier than dividing for normal human being).alan when will you guys be in the east coast?timo 2:56pm | jan 6, 2009 dave, prius is a non-efficient parallel hybrid car.
this will reduce the road area the vehicle takes (thus doubling city density) and will half the air drag thus reaching much bigger ranges with same battery packs.
i am still reasearching specs and power enchancements from several sources.
:oops:roy 1:51pm | okt 23, 2009 rawsteel, that engine is 0.8 litre or roughly 50 cid.
i can see one issue with this being a situation where a battery pack still has some power left but not enough to reach a destination.
i suspect that the e1 has 3 of these 84+kg batteries and the e2 would have 5 or 6.
i would like to suggest, first, that it be made impossible (without owner- modifications) to drive away without unplugging the car.
both of these modes of usage seems would solve most of the logistical issues related to batteries including slow recharge.
i thought it was clear that i am speculating, hence i say: "manufacturing and supply process…might add up more than conventional car".
us based energy, materials, manufacturing is of us strategic importance and dovetails with rets high fuel efficiency (150mpg) and related green technology!
tesla are monitoring new battery techs and will use combination of price, reliability (quality) cycle capacity and energy capacity as measurements of what to use.
so you find only few blogs in germany on topic.
again it shows the vision and courage to bring an ev into production against all odds.
roadster sport (afaik) beats nearly all factory-build sportcars in quarter mile.
you can directly determine power from this data by multiplying the wh/mile by the mph at a given data point.
80% out of 300 miles is 240 miles.
the batteries will also vary slightly, although using so many you would think that they would average out.
however, my point is, if a company or an entrepreneur would state flat out that they "will not look at any "bright ideas" unless there is a deminstratable prototype" then they will definitely not be the ones that could have benefited greatly monetarily or have "changed the world".
my name comes from bible: "timotheus", even that i'm not religious nor are my parents.
but, i will continue to work in this direction on my own, because i am not convinced that it will not work.
average driving in a roadster uses about 240 watthours per mile, or 0.24 kwh per mile.
14 billion kwh divided by 10kwh gives 1.4 billion cars.
any feedback would be greatly appreciated guys!
i think tesla business model is perfectly correct where additional engine generator to feed electricity to the ess is not adopted.
ideally two side by side course runs would enable two riders to compete in the sporting event sense of a timed uphill race.
ev battery pack can never be charged as fast as you can fill a gas tank (just basic physics) unless you get some superconductive wiring to do the trick in distant future.
80% out of 160 miles is 128 miles.
on the other hand: i read somewhere else (don't remember where) that we have not really "scourged the earth" for lithium.
longer, taller and wider than roadster (5.0 x 1.9 x 1.2 vs 3.9 x 1.8 x 1.1).
this is a much better solution than a towable battery.
also that you need only 1.5kg of lithium for 1kwh battery that means that it costs $45 to get 1kwh battery.
i came to know tesla motors maybe 2007, and i loved the design of the roadster, but i find roadster impractical an too expensive.
cm 3:55pm | okt 21, 2009 brian h: i don't know the current total of deliveries, i only find out when there is an announcement from tesla.
i have suggested before that i think tesla should offer these premium batteries as an option, would get over 30% more range.jeremy lansman timo wrote on march 23rd, 2009 at 6:25 pm "kevin cardinale: in-wheel motors may reduce transmission losses about 30% of less than 5% what it is now.
i would say on average the annual cost for fuel and maintenance on autos exceeds $3000.
these losses are somewhat different than the others because they represent a roughly constant power draw on the vehicle regardless of speed, winds or elevation changes.
if you use batteries that doesn't need managing that will lower the auxiliary power needed.
the liion batteries used in the roadster do not suffer the "memory effect" that plagued old nicad batteries, unlike nicads, frequent shallow discharge and recharge will not cause a loss of capacity.
joe & timo; the volt is not pure electric.
and so my question is,can telsa's software-alogrithm find and monitor in real-time the weakest link and thus prevent a chemical melt-down.
with each motor attached to a dual propeller drive system such as say volvo's ips system has.
any more outdated and it would require someone to run in front of it waving red flag.
i have been told by a tesla sales rep that cold is less of an enemy to the battery than heat.
battery size in kwh.
i believe building a bev pace car is entirely possible, but not very easy.
pick the right tool for the job.
one day the paint on the car would be sufficient to power batteries enough to drive 100 miles an hour across country.
that might give you the range you need with a substantial safety margin.
in the end, can telsa set the golden standard for the ev industry and lead the pack?david e. manwell 6:19pm | sep 13, 2009 roy: internal combustion engines, with their high dependence on momentum, have their highest torque at high engine speed, and need reduction gears to start the vehicle moving.
do you need to accelerate entire fuji-circuit nearly mile long straight, or would it be sufficient if you satisfy to around 250 top speed (bernd maylander says that he can reach 155mph at silverstone straight with his pace car.
cm, i wonder if superconductivity could be used for energy storage.
jason m. hendler 1:54pm | jan 2, 2009 dave, i do want people to stop obsessing about efficiency, to the point where most every sedan looks alike.
to mrclean: energy you could get from energy recovering suspension is at max tiny part of rolling resistance loss, so in case of roadster you could get tiny part of 25%.
we know that electric cars have to be the future and the tesla is a very exciting innovative leap forward.
i wonder how to solve electricity transportation and charging in military equipment.
tesla have proven that it is possible to build a sports car that is fun to drive without consuming vast quantities of oil.
in that case i really don't know what happens.
on the other hand for fairly steady driving in the range 40 mph to 80 mph even with twisting road the car would demonstrate decent range.
joshua maxwell 9:59am | mei 22, 2009 i found the article that states that toshiba has shipped the scib's to leading car makers.
our initial products are multi-fuel (including biofuel, cng, diesel, methane) off-grid transportable generators.
using that excel i found out that i need average 46mph speed to get there.
energy efficiensy of electric transmission is easily 90 % and coule be made up to 97 %.
has telsa motors ever completed on-road tests of their battery packs to end-of -useful-life.
i do believe li-polymer batteries are superior, but not nearly as dramitically as you suggest.
what could be useful is in-wheel motors in front wheels and single motor in back.
so you end up with the model in which you buy the service to replace your battery pack with some energy capacity by another battery pack with bigger energy capacity stored in it.
this means the transmission, (that can take heavy loads), can be used entirely for breaking.
the 2 seaters i am talking about are cars with half the frontal area, and the 2 people sit one behind another.
tesla uses 2.1ah 18650 style batteries.
this battery technology has a shorter recharge time, a longer life and increased safety at the expense of some energy density.
one small enough to fit on a car wouldn't do much.
main point is that they are cheap over time.
please, please get a slightly bigger battery pack as an option.
i would imagine something like $30k car with 450 mile range would make real breakthrough for bev.
torque alone only tells you how fast car can accelerate, not how far it can go.
so, your hypothetical "all speed transmission" with a high torque low rpm input would have a high rpm low torque output.
tesla's motor as designed is a 4 pole motor running up to 13000 rpm.
regular ice cars (not hybrids) do not have described energy efficiensy improvement.
that will remove all driveshafts and gearboxes and etc and i know gearbox takes about 10% of the power alone.
well the tesla car is one of the few that can drive on the moon as is so i guess weather does not bother it too much.
the current fuel distribution infrastructure would be entirely capable of supplying energy to the feed the machine.
in the past i have asked for test proof, that the telsa battery pack delivered 99,999 miles on road driving in extreme temperatures found in chicago winter and phoenix summer.
any lift generated would also create additional drag, and could possibly cause handling and stability problems.
there are research labs working on this for quite a while whith the low density ultracapacitors being recharged very quickly because of low density and then using these capacitors to recharge high density lithium batteries for example.
the tesla 750 is just cruising happily along through the snow, narry a worry, nice and warm just getting to cobo hall.
and the worst part is i'm sure the engineers briefed them on the car's operating limits but they chose to ignore them and then play them off as failures.
i look forward to seeing the exotic vehicles that will appear after we’ve fully converted to renewable sources of energy.
even the tesla is unfamiliar to most people, or they smile about.
timo 6:36am | okt 12, 2009 just read from news that there is new high energy density lithium-ion battery factory being build in finland.
it would be like showing somebody the principle or concept of a "gear" for the first time.
hence, after the energy in one battery pack gets low, just switch to the other and put the first battery pack on the turbine.
whether charging or swapping, i think people are going to want a "fill up" of an electric car to take about the same amount of time whatever form that "fill up" takes.
some clear real world testing videos of the roadster.
efficiency could extend the batteries effectiveness during all other times extending the range of the battery and car to a few thousand miles per charge.
it wasn't till the 50's when you saw gas stations as we know them today and that infrastructure wasn't complete till the 60's.
there are few techs that have theoretic capacity of over 2kwh/kg.
fast charging - fast charging of roadster battery ( e.g. in 10 minutes ) requires a 300 kw.
however, if that is true, then who cares about "silicon nanowire" batteries with 10 times the capacity of current batteries.
the engineers of today are saying the same thing about wheel-to-ground vehicles, they say, "the road we are pushing against is moving away faster and faster as speed increases so there is no way to have constant torque at any speed."
solar power should be the fondation for all our electrical needs.
yes, i realize that the roadster spent some time traveling across sweden and that it was "tested" in a cold climate, but that isn't the same thing here.
if you can prove your impossible claim, you'll be a serious contender for a nobel prize in physics".
lots of numbers!cm 7:24pm | jun 18, 2009 aleksndar, generators convert mecanical power into electrical power.
energy is not free, not magnetic, not electric and not kinetic.
when exhausted, the residue is a mass of fluffy alumina "foamed" solid on top of the mixture, which must/can be removed for repurification.
tesla motors has a leading position that will take some time to erode.
at the risk of sounding like a conspiracy-theorist, i can't help but point out that the gm volt does more to diminish the viability of the ev than it does to extend its development.
i am not sure this how feasible it would be in looking at the ess and not knowing the way it is installed.
these losses are somewhat different than the others because they represent a roughly constant power draw on the vehicle regardless of speed, winds or elevation changes.
there are trams, metro, city buses and excellent light traffic ways.
small cars will not solve traffic jams even that they would have lower cost to drive / car.
roadster 300kg battery pack could produce 22.5mw power or about 30600 metric hp.
if the average commute is 80 miles half the energy comes from the power grid.
continuous discharge current 20a weight 40g cm, about needing a prototype, i would say you are absolutely right for probably 99% of them.
as i stated, when transportation energy techs allow clean, renewable, cheap and abundant energy, i do want to see great variations in vehicle design - some retro, some futuristic, etc.
it has permanent magnet brushless motors in each wheel.
timo 1:55pm | jan 2, 2009 dave, you again make that false claim that bev co2 "manufacturing and supply process...might add up more than conventional car".
now it's high-capacity lightweight paper batteries, coated with carbon nanotube and silver nanowire inks.
the rockets are burning(expending) the same amount of fuel every second and thrusting with the same force, and therefore the same torque, as it did at the lower rpms and even at 0 rpms.
tjd; about affording one: the $50,000 model s would lease and run for about the same total cost as a $30,000 ice car.
the "s" may just be my next car purchase.
unfortunately, i do not subscribe to nature magazine, so i can't read the whole article.
you can directly determine power from this data by multiplying the wh/mile by the mph at a given data point.
the chart shows 250 wh/mi while my read-out consistantly shows 206 wh/mi.
for 15 min it still is a lot.
bugatti veyron 1001 hp (metric hp i guess) is about 736kw. 736/1.8 = 408kg.
if it is a gasoline engine, then you'd have some sort of plug-in hybrid.
i am the biggest fan of teslar in hannover.
lastly, a lot of representatives have a personal interest in oil companies via campaign contributions or more direct interests.
with about 25 locations you could get to most anywhere in california with a fresh battery.
complaining about these shortcomings is like complaining about the trunk space of a lamborghini or the skid pad rating of a suburban.
speaking of the model s, i'd like to see some specs on the model s - real specs, like actual epa-based range data, 0-60 times, battery sizes and costs, etc.
those motors are subject to enormous shaking in fast vehicles.
if i owned a flatbed truck , i wouldn't be very happy driving it 1000 miles to louisville in a day either - i'd probably rent a corvette for the trip.
real world driving its not, but the occasional 'spurt' built in to a days driving would be more realistic.
that should net out lesser performance, not greater.
energy density isn't that high.
using that number you can calculate an interesting driving range curve for various speeds.
joe simone 2:44pm | apr 1, 2009 timo wrote on april 1st, 2009 at 1:04 pm # joe simone: ” i do not understand how you can claim to get 244 miles per charge with the roadster when gm’s volt and others are claiming 40 miles per charge with the same lithium ion battery technology.
while you’re at it, make sure to erase all of these posts before anybody else can read them, and commit an act of piracy against you.
the reason why a charge from 50% to 80% can take less time than a charge from 80% to 99% is that, for some batteries, internal resistance increases when it nears full charge.
only lpg and hybrid drive (mostly in japanese cars).
it would be nice to see more details about your drive system on the web.
- large companies have their strengths, but speedy development of new products is not one of them.
it will be interesting to see what technology wins out.
i believe the thinking is that the plug in hybrid has an unlimited range since there are gas station everywhere.
600mile range would be enough for almost all which would equal about 150kwh battery.
i do not know the answers but it might be worth exploring.
safegards could could easily be put into place to keep the battery from being overcharged .
over time, old batteries would have to be replaced, and eventually it might make more sense to replace old packs with a newer higher performing and possibly cheaper type of battery, especially if the older type is no longer made.
200kwh at five minutes needs 2.4mw connection.
however, since it shouldn't be difficult to do, i will probably as you said, "cobble up" something to definitely prove it works as advertised and to eliminate the outside chance that i may be missing something.
better battery tech is always being devloped .
gm's volt is set to charge to about 85% and discharge to 30% before the motor/generator kicks in.
if one kwh costs about 10 cents that is $2500. 15882 - 2500 = 13382.
better place ( www.wired.com/autopia/2009/05/better-place/ ) now claims its swap stations are versatile enough to cope with a number of types.
weight could be much less.
but as far as any "range extender" is concerned, it is irrelevant, as the main function of a range extender is to take over the electrical load from the battery pack, not to recharge the battery, and it would partially recharge the battery ony if there was surplus power available.
timo 2:14pm | mei 19, 2009 joshua maxwell; i'm not sure how you would benefit from low energy density expensive capacitors compared to batteries.
in that same article both diesel and petrol get only 30 gallons of ice fuel from 44 gallons of oil.
wheel-mounted generators can be used to regenerate energy while braking, that's all.
conventional ice vehicles are usually thrashed in environments like this where i've seen steering wheels fall apart, paint flake off, and things like door handles simply break just due to cold.
generators convert mechanical effort into electical effort, so your generator idea would slow the car down just like applying the brakes, that's what "regenerative braking" is.
if the model s has a similar efficiency curve, (thats a big "if") then a rough estimate to get a 400 mile (644 km) would also mean travelling at about 45 mph (72 kmph).
one reason the old 2 speed blew up was the bone crushing force that was hitting all parts of the transmission from the electric motor while "speed shifting".
earl 11:52am | jan 10, 2009 mark, the roadster has regeneration on the 'gas' pedal.
you can imagine electric motor as rockets at the wheel if you like.
the only “transmission” is the single, all-electric (perhaps non-electronic) power train; one “controller” handles the whole car.
i am aware that the co2 coming out my tailpipe, and generated in the manufacture and supply process, are not insignificant, and may actually add up to more than that for a conventional car.
timo 11:31am | sep 9, 2009 steve, can't answer to your question about cda (have wondered that myself, afaik it isn't exceptionally good, just usual modern car.
they run quietly and they can be dimensioned to slip at a given torque value.
as i in previous message wrote we can't create energy we can only convert it.
charge time for batteries can be about the same as fueling time for hydrogen.
i think that long-haul truckers need charging stations that work as restaurants as well.
of those options, steam is the least satisfactory, for automotive use steam isn't very efficient, consuming more fuel, and car radiators are too small to condense all the steam which means frequent stops for water fill-ups.
what i have read ,i hope to see this company go far.
in other words windmill slows that air movement in order to generate energy, and that generates air drag.
pure bev is entirely different beast.
the other issue to keep in mind is that these losses are determined by relative wind speed over the vehicle -- not necessarily the speed over the ground.
the weight of your car is mostly batteries.
the longer range battery is a convenience for the occasional vacation trip or other long trip need.
e.g. the way to work in germany averages 1 jour drive, appr.
can contain spoilers about mythbuster episode, so don't read if you dont want to get spoiled.
the news that came out this past week said that the new tech.
so you lose 20% in making car move and another 20% from generated energy so net gain is only 64% (20% out of 80% is 16%).
maximum discharge rate power is obviously a lot more (about 200kw), and so is also maximum charge power, but that just is not used in usual charging.
i found but did not digest others.
just to add an exemple to this look at the renault fluenz e-z concept which use photovoltaïc cells to help the battery in giving power to the climatisation and other electronic on board.
moreover, could someone tell me what is the energy efficiency, in % , from the outlet to the wheels for different driving cycles ?
the only viable sizes i can imagine are probably no more than 30kw cable which will have about 1/4" diameter.
there are no mystical ways to get energy from nothing, all energies come from some energy source.
## you could hire this from tesla when you wanted to go touring and place your roadster into a 4′th mode reev.
when we are freewheeling down a hill -presumably the regenerative braking is happening in an electric car due to the fact that the power is not applied and the motors act as generators.
"might" far from offering facts (i'm not an expert on any of this), rather i am trying to encourage sober thought and careful research before jumping on the bandwagon.
dividing up the battery pack into removable modules wasn't considered for the roadster, due to the cooling requirements of the battery, and also because a smaller battery offers less power - not good for a sports car!
the 0.9 kwh/ kg increases a roadster range by 5 times to 1220 miles.
battery swap system would allow relatively fast method of "charging" but realistic "fits to all" system does not exist and i don't think will ever do (just too few customers for it to be profitable).
in fact i don't believe they ever will get close to even nimh batteries.
if you start out with a full battery charge, and it takes 15kw to drive at highway speeds, then a 10kw generator running all the time would reduce the battery drain to 5kw, and yield a total of 10 hours of driving (= 500+ miles).
people who love cabs would die for a great cab with 4 seats.
in batteries energy is in electric potential.
may be in near future we will all have 2 vehicles.
these ultracapacitors would recharge a secondary offline battery system of perhaps lithium polymer batteries as well as driving the car.
of course, if you could take 1 or 2 rest breaks along the way and get a partial recharge, you'd be able to drive a bit faster than that!
interestingly, they did consider it, but jb said it would have made safety certification extremely difficult.
race-conditions are so much different than ordinary road conditions that i'm not able to estimate how long does that last.
i think it is hard to dispute that in honest way based on numbers, facts etc.
this translates to the us consuming 14 billion kilowatt hour per day in the form of gasoline for automobile travel.
one could buy such a vehicle and use it for both everyday commutes as well as longer trips, since there is presently a network of petroleum fueling station across the country.
coal generates a lot of pollution and clean coal is a long way off: http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/coalvswind/c02c.html if that coal burning energy was converted over to nuclear there would be no question that the nuclear would be cleaner than gasoline powered travel.
the public at large is used to pulling into gas stations for fill ups that take a couple of minutes rahter commuting or taking a long drive.
since one weights 680g that is 31835000g/680g = 46816 units.
the transmission on the power/speed/usage curves seem to be telling that it can't get out of its own way at high speeds.
the overhead umbilical dollie would be powered itself, not pulled along by the ev.
one can try to increase the energy available or try to reduce the energy consumed.
just as the computer industry has flouished with w3c standards and ieee standards for connectivity (protocols, ports, physical plugs etc.), electric car technology can flourishes with interchanging power packs.
if a company like yours designed a vehicle that adapted wind turbines in the vehicle to re-energize the batteries as you drive then there would be no need for gasoline or grid.
that power density is tremendous.
the typical full capacity of a new battery pack when charged to 100% in maximum range mode and discharged steadily over 3 hours is about 55kwh.
your are right about energy has no free lunch, but not correct in thinking it requires more energy to achieve a given speed quickly.
even riceburners like honda managed to make a handsome car with their cab s2000 although a bit too small and unpractical.
third: cars are not alike.
i did use generator and not alternator because i understand that this is direct current power.
as i said in my previous post i have driven several military vehicles and every single one of those had awd.
energy loss distribution: to understand why these curves have the shapes that they do it is helpful to examine where the energy actually goes.
this makes electric cars better positioned for the future co2 reduction compared to gasoline cars.
brakes are just ordinary friction brakes, so no difference there.
speed of recharging is not battery/flywheel problem, it is grid connection problem.
while this graph shows that driving range greater than 300 miles should be possible, the conditions to do this are quite rare: steady-state driving at 30 mph (no stops or starts) for more than 10 hours!
the first 5yrs comes with the purchase and come in for 5yr service which will include pulling and testing each cell and replacing the ones that are showing signs of failing, and pay the $5k for each 5yrs.)
roy 6:46am | sep 5, 2009 timo: it was my understanding that the prototype roadsters were 54kwh and the production 52kwh using 2.1ah batteries instead of 2.2ah as a cost savings.
that "car" was able to pivot like a motorcycle but had engine-part (one wheel) steady like a car.
range comes from energy storage capacity / energy losses at certain speed.
the first electric car that can do that for less than $60,000 canadian dollars will get my attention and its manufacturer will probably get my money.
transmission is the weak point of the tesla (well, not so weak, but still).
the best thing about electric drive its that there is no tradeoff between peformance and milage.
so for the model s---play with the gear ratio and talk to some tranny peeps who are experts with overdrives.
brian h 8:10pm | okt 22, 2009 just saw a press release yesterday saying deliveries were "nearing" 900, so i guess that's as current as it gets.
geothermal alone has potential for several thousand times world energy need, and solar is potentially practically infinite.
we should know if eestor is real by years' end, it is good for a million cycles.
that would mean very high power density.
this company has designed a midsized four door to be produced for $50,000 and is asking the government to loan them $450 mil to help start up of its production.
i would think that for that kind of money, it should have it.
because every wh energy counts, and the more ev's are out there the more electricity we will need and we need to compensate it somehow or add it to our calculations.
bms usually includes fuses and other protective features such as shutting down on overtemperature.
if you are going to be towed anyhow, why not show some green to friendly (??) truck driver and get charged half way.
suspension could follow some conventional four-wheel independent suspension arrangement.
the foil would also be uv-protective and does supposedly only cost a 10th to manufacturer then regular solar panels.
if your idea involves some unknown energy source, we'd better learn all about that energy source first.
if you wont to see how the good dc motors can be with minium use of battery power, look up csrio in australia and see how they are getting 98% out of there motors.
this effect would be even more pronounced if the heater or a/c system were operating.
what requires thick cables is amps, not volts, so if you increase volts you can have that same cable serving five times that wattage.
this really come in handy especially if you going to drive a long didtance.
also if cycle life is better and battery size get doubled (kw), that is *at least* twice the durability in charge/discharge cycling.
in most other cars, it comes from the gasoline engine, but an electric car has no gasoline engine.
it is enough to charge slowly at home to have full battery every morning.
that means it is only a bit larger than an exercise book.
the regen braking would impose resistance for the tow truck to overcome.
assuming a four wheeled vehicle, one alternative might be four-wheel steering, as gm pickup trucks had, a few years ago, with their so-called "quadratrack".
another ways to reduce air drag is use cameras for rear views.
as for safety the typical driver would not perform this task.
that doesn't turn off buyers of 100 mph "gassers", in the $50,000 price range.
then, there is no fossil fuel being used at all.
this effect would be even more pronounced if the heater or a/c system were operating.
i just have been watching this website for a long time and know pretty much everything someone has written here at some point.
if you would like to “play” with these numbers yourself, below is a link to an excel file with the table of data used to generate these graphs.
with new battery techs coming it will be possible to build bev that could beat nitrodragster in acceleration (with right tires) and would still be safe and economic to drive in roads.jdsim 9:35am | aug 14, 2009
without the need to change basic design of the vehicles, the effect would be unbelievable.
i worry that such swap stations may become a place people try to dump older batteries they have been charging at home for several years or that i may get a battery that has been abused in some fashion.
i.e. 55/60 hz rife technology, and the bob beck protocol could be employed to actually cure diseases when driving the vehicle, having a positive effect, and actually curing disease whilst driving.
once the infrastructure for those is in place the need for a generator will disappear.
at the end of this long write up i want to wish you all a good health for the new 2009 and let it bring us some great inventions and products that we can use sooner.
i am saving for my own tesla car in 2011, and will mortgage everything just to have one!
better place ( http://www.wired.com/autopia/2009/05/better-place/ ) now claims its swap stations are versatile enough to cope with a number of types.
that could be very very good for ev (very low cda).
text talks about 170kw/kg power density.
in future there might be, but as you can see from my post to joshua maxwell current ultracaps have two-three orders of magnitude too weak energy density, and there is nothing in sight to show that they get much better than that.
timo 9:42am | sep 28, 2009 gr: problem with hydrogen fuel cell is that you don't have hydrogen accessible anywhere.
lights are positioned too close to the windshield and adds a nerdy look.
remember that when the model t debuted in 1908 you only could by gas at the refinery.
tesla motors has a clever way of converting the electric motor into a generator whenever the car needs to slow down, and that partially recharges the battery.
as long as you trickle charge at home or any other way you do not pay for battery pack swapping.
keeping it "topped off" also makes it less likely to run out during an unexpected extra trip!timo 5:43pm | jan 13, 2009 cm: how would you make battery swapping station profitable?
also battery itself slows things down.
the van is newer - maybe 45k on it - and we have taken 4 or 5 trips in it as well.
in a few more years even die-hard fuel cell advocates will give up completely.
present irrefutable facts based on actual data.
it means 400 w, so it would be 1.4 miles per hours of charging.
it's probably about the most important data that i can think of about an ev - and only tm makes it so readily available for its evs.
electric cars have lot of potential to have flat floor which helps aerodinamics also.
by then, battery tech may have changed significantly, though.
there they not only look cool but as a "side effect" actually enhance range!
we need autonomous cars, a cheap computer posted every 1 mile that has grid cordinance, road conditions, ubstructions, gps, etc transmitted to the cars.
so far the geared transmissions are only used at around 1000 rpm - low power, but the magnet holders are only made out of plastic.
all 18650 batteries weigh in about the same range of 43 to 48 grams.
