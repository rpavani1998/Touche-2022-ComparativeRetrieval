in a software company a product release affects everyone.
but i do have the firm belief that the only people who can deliver on this are engineers with a bit of business savvy.
a mistimed release can severely impact sales, cash flow, and the company.
the release runs like a train schedule, whoever makes it to the station on time is part of the release.
(we generally announce new releases to promote new features we’ve incorporated recently that we think will help build sales, so they tend to be feature-driven…but i can see how a different kind of firm would prefer a date-driven focus.)reply “engineering, of course, needs to deliver product and not get distracted.”
while all of this discussion on product releases sounds great, none of it really matters if you do not have the experienced team that can manage them and instill the discipline.
not because they’re incompetent, but because it’s harder than it looks, and you need to have a feel for what’s possible and what isn’t.

i have to admit i was quite pleased with our new vp engineering as she put forth her methodology and process, shared below.
everyone knows the ship date and sets their schedule accordingly to ensure that all pistons are running as ga hits.
mr. sim has over 15 years of venture capital experience having led seed and first round investments in a number of high profile internet and software companies.
the other release is content driven; the team knows what is in the next release, but does not know the exact ship date.
so it also requires having the right management and experience to balance the priorities to deliver the right product on time.
no amount of “discipline” enforcing 80 hours weeks is going to change the laws of physics.
of course, just because it is date driven does not mean that there isn't a highly focused theme.

it runs on a schedule and therefore may not be filled to an efficient capacity or overly filled during rush hour.

perhaps the discipline of meeting a date is important for a young company but my experience is that you don’t want to go through the expense of a release unless you’re sure customer needs will be met.

richard also has a great post on how schedules don’t make the trains run on time but people do.
it just forces the team to clarify the absolute minimum requirements necessary to deliver the right product for the market.

most importantly, having a date driven release can get everyone at the company aligned.
i am just saying that too often companies get obsessed with filling the plane with too many features and requirements without doing the hard prioritization and analysis of what is most importantly going to make customers happy and drive new sales.
this eliminates the tension between date-driven and feature-driven approaches, as the better choice will generally be obvious once we have an answer to the question of why we feel the need to announce a new release.

sales knows when it can start telling prospects about the new product and time it appropriately so it can get customers lined up for the next quarter without delaying sales in the existing one.

non-technical managers almost always fail at this.

as you see in my post, i mention that “of course, just because it is date driven does not mean that there isn’t a highly focused theme.

this means marketing has to have its collateral ready, upgrade program in place, and product launch schedule set.
the release runs more like an airplane shuttle, it takes off only when full.
