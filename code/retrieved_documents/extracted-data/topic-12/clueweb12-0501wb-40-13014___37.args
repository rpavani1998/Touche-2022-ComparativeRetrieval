some people aren't in a hurry to get from a to b and are willing to pay a premium for great food and great views.
jet after jet dumps greenhouse gases at 38,000 feet -- the equivalent of what each passenger might emit in a year of routine highway driving.
a greyhound bus costs half the price and is faster, with daily service.
that point in time may be far in the future, but if we arrive at that point having kept our hand in the passenger train business, we'll be better off for it.
tycoons of industry are not normally known for being slow on the uptake.
they actually had written high-speed rail into the state constitution but jeb ran a misinformation campaign to get it voted out.
it won't be easy, i'll guarantee you.
most of today's train travellers are affluent seniors, in no rush to get anywhere.
until this year, bc reneged on a promise for track improvements to increase capacity (red herring) to allow a second train up to vancouver instead of it terminating in bellingham.

it wouldn't be easy.
his jets were slimmed-down, efficient, un-luxurious modes of transport that would go 600 mph to cross the continent in 5 hours.
the cost factor will be what puts air travel back into the 'jet setters' again and leaves the rest with either puddle jumping (in normally aspirated engines like cessna-152's) or accepting the time delay and riding the rails.
something everyone forgets with "business meetings" is that a lot of them aren't strictly necessary.

whatever class you travel in, you soon realize that every freight train outranks you.
it could eventually be connected to the california line.

total cost accounting of the current system with its attendant costs for deaths, enforcement, etc makes highway travel more expensive than it appears imo.

the reality that regular cargo gets priority over passengers should come as no surprise, the cargo was paid for long ago and regularly and there is no passenger rail service anywhere any time that was not subsidised by cargo shipments.
or, as we did, you can sleep in a fairly comfortable roomette with your own toilet, sink, and door.
even at an average speed of 200 km/h it would take 25 hours to reach toronto from vancouver and the cost of laying and maintaining the track would be astronomical considering it would have to be laid across the rockies and the canadian shield.
such short haul trips could include vancouver to whistler; calgary to edmonton; medium haul trips (over night)
george monbiot, in his book heat, confesses he can find no solution for air travel as a contributor to global warming.

not likely, you are just as likely to see a greyhound bus equivalent cattle car stuck between the grain cars, with grease and coal smoke smeared windows, no food or water and no stops for 5 hours.

thus, freight gets the right-of-way, while passenger gets the siding.
given today's airport hassles and the need to show oneself considerably before flight departure, and getting to and from airports usually quite distanced from the city centres one is destined for.
but our sudden understanding of global warming has made us more than nervous.
it may take another 20 years but the price of fuel will kill mass air travel in the end, and put it only in the hands of the 'jet setting' rich.

therefore, there's more consistency, hence more money in freight.
other transportation systems can reduce their emissions, but airliners are locked into burning kerosene at high altitudes.
i'll be happy to put in a few thousand into shares for a good business plan..... .....knowing all the while it could fail, like my friend's high-speed catamaran service from vancouver to sechelt.... 4 years ago i am glad we have rail travel for a number of reasons.
8000 km of new track would equal a whole new opportunity for entrepreneurs to provide service to the population.
sounds like a plug, but i don't work there, althought i was working when i took those trips.
it also starts at $789 per person, based on double occupancy plus taxes and goes up to $2493 for the best package.
maybe you'd save a couple of hundred dollars if you drove, but it would be a costly saving.
the global warming scam has peaked and all the pretty stars and photo ops won't prevent the bust.
because the trains 'tilt', they are able to take curves faster and because they have a lower centre of gravity, they are more stable.

it seems to me that viarail is exploiting a nostalgia factor, with its appeal to riders in no particular hurry, and that its pricing, or over-pricing, is keeping many from the service who would otherwise use it.
you aren't crammed into a tiny space, you are not bullied by security people, you don't have your time wasted by needing to be at your departure point two hours early, you get fresh air, you can walk around all you want, your ears don't pop unless you climb a mountain, you see the scenery, you have fewer type a (rude, rushed, pushy) fellow passengers around you, you can use your cell phone...

even environmentalists fly and or travel to meetings and conferences!
and i can feel good about perhaps doing less damage to the environment, though i agree with southdeltawalker that the real solution is to cut our motorized travel as much as we can (walking and cycling i think are okay).
