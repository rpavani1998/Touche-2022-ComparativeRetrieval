our grills were 55g drums sawed in half and converted.
as our fires were always from cured woods, they would more resemble "lump" charcoal which is simply wood reduced to the black carbon state you see in burned out campfires.
searing alone at that temp produces the char flavor, no coals needed.
i may add wood chips in 30 min or so by pulling the chip tray out and adding what i want then push the tray back in.
this has always been at the top list of questions for grill masters.

if you want the smoky flavor of wood with the convenience of gas there is a heavy iron box that holds chips that can be placed over the gas flame.

i needed to control the temperature of heat better than just moving the pile to one half and placing the meat over the less intense side (i usually put the "pyramid" towards the hinge/back area leaving the front/handle area free of charcoal).
you put the charcoal in the top of the chimney, then put two pieces of crumpled newspaper in the bottom.
the easy light charcoal idea came from recycling the papertowel and paperbags i use for bacon greese absorbsion, these bacon soaked paper products burn extra long when twited tight and layed under easylight charcoal, one can also fix a two briquette by what ever length of easylight charcoal::::::::::: and then place the regular charcoal over the top of the eastlight, maybe 3-5 reg-charcoal's by whatever length you anticipait you need, and the twisted bacon soaked paper goes underneth the charcoals.
and let's face it--charcoal also involves an enticing element of danger.

since you can't dial down the heat of white-hot coals, it's a good strategy to leave empty spaces on the lower grill grate (areas without briquettes).
i use mesquite or other hardwood wrapped in aluminum foil and placed on the burners with a few holes popped in the foil.
