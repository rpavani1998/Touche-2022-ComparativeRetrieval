Revealed: How our pet cats, dogs and even fish are 
right or left 'handed' <br>
Revealed: How our pet cats, dogs and even fish are 
right or left 'handed' <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Cats, dogs, parrots and even 
fish are right or left-handed, scientists have revealed.<br>
<br>
The discovery 
was made by psychologists from Queen's University Belfast, who as part of their 
research played with 42 pet cats for weeks on end.<br>
<br>
They found that 
females are 'right-handed' while toms favour the left.<br>
<br>
Dogs are the 
same - until they are spayed or neutered, when the difference disappears, 
suggesting hormones play a role in left or right-handedness.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Paw preference: Female dogs favour their right front paw and males choose their 
left, according to the study<br>
<br>
The scientists also reported that parrots 
will pick up objects with their 'dominant' foot, toads are mostly right-handed 
and fish will have a preference to left or right when they dodge a predator - 
and even humpback whales prefer the right side of their jaws when feeding.<br>

<br>And dogs wag their tails to the right when relaxed and to the left when 
agitated, this week's New Scientist reports.<br>
<br>
The experts said: 'Male 
and female cats differ in their behavioural patterns, for example hunting 
styles and parental care, and it is possible that these place different demands 
on motor functioning.'<br>
<br>
<br>
Female felines use their right paw while 
toms tend to use their left<br>
<br>
Dr Culum Brown, a behavioural ecologist, 
said they also tested the theory with parrots: 'Anything they are interested in 
they will pick up with their dominant foot.'<br>
<br>
Curiously, those parrots 
that favour their left or right rather than liking both equally, have been 
shown to be brainier.<br>
<br>
With goldfish, the way they dodge predators is 
likely to allow them to use a specific eye and side of the brain to deal with 
the threat.<br>
<br>
To test it out, place an unfamiliar object in the centre 
of your fish tank and watch which way your pet swims round it.<br>
<br>
Toads, 
however, prefer their right, and pounce more quickly on morsels of food that 
enter their line of vision from their right.<br>
<br>
Humpback whales prefer to 
use the right side of their jaws to scape up sand eels from the ocean floor.<br>
<br>While there are advantages in following the crowd, it can also be good to 
be different.<br>
<br>
For instance, those humans or animals that are 
left-handed, or pawed, in a right-handed world, have the surprise on their side 
when they launch an attack.<br>
<br>
New Scientist says: 'Numerous studies have 
found that left-handers have an advantage in many sports involving a direct 
opponent, such as tennis or boxing, and the advantages may run to more serious 
encounters: many sports are forms of ritualised conduct, after all.'<br>
