<p><b>14.1 INTRODUCTION</b> </p> 
<p>The pragmatic and practical approach to the main body of this work largely 
omits reference to those visions or beliefs classifiable as spiritual or 
mystical; not because these are not a normal part of human experience, but 
because they are arrived at as a result of long contemplation or intense 
involvement with the mysteries that eternally surround us. We may 
&quot;dream&quot; understanding, but it is something we cannot demand, define, 
or teach to others; it is for each of us to develop.<br>
 There are things that 
nobody else can help us with, but in a book written to help people make 
real-Iife decisions, to build new landscapes, to regenerate damaged forests, 
and to lighten our load on earth, the present need is for clear and practical 
approaches.</p> 
<p>In the preceding chapters, well-tried and common- sense techniques and 
strategies of earth restoration have been described and figured. All of this 
comes to naught if we, as a people, continue to invest in arms and destruction, 
to permit land abuse, and to fail to tackle the social and political 
impediments to reclaiming desertified and abused lands, or even to prevent the 
poisoning of land. Thus, (be following sections give strategies for change in 
the social and economic areas of society). These strategies may, in fact, be of 
more assistance to real change than the skills of land management, for society 
has far more competent farmers and engineers than it has ethical bankers or 
lawyers whose work relates to curing or preventing (not just treating) social 
and environmental problems.</p> 
<p>First we must learn to grow, build, and manage natural systems for human 
and earth needs, and then teach others to do so) In this way, we can build a 
global, interdependent, and cooperative body of people&nbsp; involved in 
ethical land and resource use, whose teaching is founded on research but is 
also locally available everywhere, and locally demonstrable in many thousands 
of small enterprises covering the whole range of human endeavours, from primary 
production to quaternary system management; from domestic nutrition and economy 
to a global network of small financial systems. Such work is urgent, important, 
and necessary, and we cannot leave it to the whims of government (always 
short-term) or industry as we know it today.</p> 
<p>We know how to solve every food, clean energy, and sensible shelter problem 
in every climate: we have already invented and tested every necessary technique 
'and technical device, and have access to all the biological material that we 
could ever use.</p> 
<p>The tragic reality is that very few sustainable systems are designed or 
applied by those who hold power, and the reason for this is obvious and simple: 
to let people arrange their own food, energy, and shelter is to lose economic 
and political control over them. We should cease to look to power structures, 
hierarchical systems, or governments to help us, and devise ways to help 
ourselves.</p> 
<p>Thus, the very first strategies we need are those that put our own house in 
order, and at the same time do not give credibility to distant power-centred or 
unethical systems. In our present fiscal or money-run world, the primary 
responsibility that we need to take charge of is our wealth, which is the 
product of our sweat and our region, not representable by valueless currency.
</p> 
<p>There is no need to stress that we are imperfect </p> 
<p>PAGE 507 <br>
 people, living in an imperfect world; &quot;Do not adjust 
your vision, reality is at fault&quot; (graffiti), so that many strategies 
given here are starting points rather than endpoints. However, there is so much 
damage to ecosystems-hence so much rehabilitative work to do-that we will be 
employed in good works for a few generations to come. In several generations 
(if we are allowed this time) we may have achieved a truly free world of 
international affinities, but we always start where we are.</p> 
<p>In this chapter, therefore, I will try to set out the currently sucessful 
social strategies that enable a small group or a region to define problems and 
to solve them locally.</p> <b></b> 
<p><b>14.2</b> <br>
<b>ETHICAL BASIS OF AN ALTERNATIVE NATION</b> <br>
 &nbsp; 
</p> <i></i> 
<p><i>People without an agreed-upon common basis to their actions is neither a 
community nor a nation. A people with a common ethic is a nation wherever they 
live. Thus, the place of habitation is secondary to a shared belief in the 
establishment of an harmonious world community. Just as we can select from all 
extant ethics and beliefs those elements that we see to be sustainable, useful, 
and beneficial to life and to our community. It would appear that;.Sustainable 
societies emphasise the duties and responsibilities of people to nature equal 
to those of people to people; that any code relates equally to other lifeforms 
and elements of landscape. To conduct oneself only in terms of response to 
other people gives a potential to evade responsibility for damage inflicted in 
the total resource base, and thus utlimately to others. Beneficial behavious 
involves managing natural systems for their own, and our, long-term benefit, 
not for our immediate and exploitative personal gain. The American Indians 
(Irequois nation) frame this as a &quot;seventh generation&quot; concept: that 
our decisions now are carried out in terms of their benefit or disadvantage to 
our descendants in seven generations' time about 100 years ahead). This helps 
explain why we always found tribally managed lands to be rich in natural life 
resources, and why we have managed to ruin much of the resources we inherited.
</i> </p> 
<ul> <i></i> 
<li><i>As people, we need to adopt an ethic of right livelihood, for if we 
bend our labour and skills to work that is destructive, we are the destroyers. 
We lay waste to our lives in proporation to the environment. Although socities 
for social responsibility are rapidly forming, we need to expand the concept to 
social and environmental responsibility, and to create our own financial and 
employment strategies in those areas. We should not be passive workers for 
established destructive systems, but rather we can investors in</i>life. We 
cannot profess or teach one ethic, and live&nbsp; another, without damage to 
ourselves and to common t resources.</li> 
<li>&nbsp;We must always study and learn as part of a total&nbsp; integrated 
system framework, conscious of how our knowledge and actions permeate all 
systems. It is in the, fragmenting of knowledge into unrelated disciplines that 
we can plead ignorance of effects; but we are always responsible for the 
distant effects of our actions, and in fact should work for foreseen benefits.
</li> 
<li>We need to develop conserver socirties, with this conservation achieved by 
close attention to recycling, the avoidance of waste, and to very durable 
technologies so that their use is prolonged. Similarly, it is unwise to abandon 
satisfactory older forms of technology even if we install improved forms and 
processes; just because we develop anew windmill for electricity, we should not 
allow a dependable older grain mill to sink into disrepair. Because we can uSe 
a forage harvester, it doesn't mean we should lose the&nbsp; skill to use a 
scythe on steep slopes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part of being 
conservative is to concentrate on developing a mosaic of small, 
well-managed,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and effective systems. Such 
modest systems are unlikely to cause&nbsp; widespread upheavals or to be&nbsp; 
subject to external or unethical control.</li> 
<li>Meaning in life is lost by striving after status and future glory; It is 
gained and realised by actIon towards a common ideal, in serving the whole 
according to our physical, mental, educational, and revelationary 
(understanding) capacities. It is never enough to mean well&nbsp; (&quot;fair 
words plant no cabbages&quot;),rather, it is necessary to ensure that it gets 
done.</li> 
<li>Security can be found in the renunciation of ownership over people, money, 
and real assets; insecurity and unhappiness arises as a result of trying&nbsp; 
gain, keep or protect that which others need for&nbsp; periods of legitimate 
access. A lending library enables , people to help themselves to information; a 
locked-up&nbsp; book collection is useful only to the person who owns it.</li> 
<li>If an ethical and responsible community can establish a durable, 
dependable, and waste-free resource base, then leisure time (time to express 
our individual capacities) becomes a plentiful resource. We will have gained 
time for life. While leisure is inevitably&nbsp; available for enrichment of 
cultural life, and to an extent for recreation, emphasis on spectator 
recreation is just another way to waste the time gained; we then see the 
professionalisation of arts, sciences, sport, and even education as spectators 
replace actors.</li> </ul> 
<p>We should therefore resolve to gain time to evolve ever more effective ways 
to assist systems or people. It is only when others feel secure that we need 
not guard our environments, so that the very best preparation for security is 
to teach others the strategies, ethics, and practices of resource management, 
and to extend aid and education wherever possible.</p> 
<p>I do not, in my lifetime, or that of my children's </p> 
<p>PAGE 508 </p> 
<p>children, foresee a world where there are no eroded soils, stripped 
forests, famine, or poverty, but I do see a way in which we can spend our lives 
towards earth repair. If and when the whole world is secure, we have won a 
right to explore space, and the oceans. Until we have demonstrated that we can 
establish a productive and secure earth society, we do not belong anywhere 
else, nor (1 suspect) would we be welcome elsewhere.</p> <b></b> 
<p><b>14.3 A NEW NATIONS</b> </p> 
<p>The &quot;United Nations&quot; today is neither united nor represents 
nations; it is like the oft-quoted &quot;moral majority&quot;, which is also 
neither of those things! Many true nations, such as the Iroquois confederation 
or any tribal alliance with a common ethic, are not represented by such a body, 
nor are whole nations such as the Basques, Tartars, Kurds, Palestinians, 
Hawaiians, Hopi, Tibetans, Pitjatjantjara, Misquito, Aranda, Basarwa, Herrero 
etc etc etc.</p> 
<p>Most nations in the United Nations repress a majority of peoples on earth. 
Talking with Thomas Banyaca, a Hopi messenger of his people, it became clear to 
me that we need anew concept of &quot;nation&quot; , and anew representative 
body to speak for them. We start by defining a nation as a people subscribing 
to a common&nbsp; ethic, and aspiring to a similar culture. Such nations may 
not have a common land base, or language, but do have a common ethic, minimally;
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>To care for the earth; to repair and conserve; </li> 
<li>To seek peace, and to guard human rights every where; and </li> 
<li>To invest all capital, intelligence, goodwill, and labour to these ends. 
</li> </ul> 
<p>At present, many thousands of organisations, affinities, tribes, 
bioregions, and spiritual and<br>
 non-government organisations aspire to such 
beneficial&nbsp; ends; in every continent, a majority of people-the ethical 
majority-want peace; a clean and forested earth; a cessation to torture, 
malnutrition, and oppression; and aright to work towards these ends.</p> 
<p>It would take very little additional organisation for these groups to meet 
together, count their numbers, and recognise each other's rights. There are, 
for instance, far less paid-up or active members of political parties or 
oppressive societies now than there are organic gardeners whose life works seek 
peace and plenty. As groups discuss, and accept, the minimal ethic above, they 
they can quickly proceed to recognise each other.</p> 
<p>Such initiatives have in fact cmmenced in the Amerindian groups subject to 
national (i.e. political) oppression in both North and South America. 
Throughout the world, groups are talking of issuing<br>
 their own passports, 
or adopting world citizen status- given a common aim. Perhaps the first move to 
a new body of nations united in earth care .are the bioregional , and tribal 
congresses that are occurring today.</p> 
<p>Unlike the present United Nations, we do not need a world centre, or paid 
administrators, but can instead meet as affinity groups (e.g. in alternative 
economic summits, bioregional congresses, tribal conferences, garden and farm 
design groups) to deal with our specific areas of interest, and to make these 
affinities global in scope. By avoiding centralised administrations, we avoid 
power blocs, and by avoiding tax funding, we avoid inefficiency. Fees for a 
regional secretariat would arise from an annual fee forwarded by participant 
groups.</p> 
<p>Once continental groups and some global groups have allied, these 
congresses can increasingly bring in less informed or more remote groups to 
share resources in an humane alliance; after all, global seed exchanges, 
technology groups, gardening forums, and regional groups already meet and are 
increasing in cooperation. A concept of a global nation is, in fact, very well 
developed in such groups, and the idea of war or oppression across race, 
language, or territory is anthema to those allied in good works. The advantage 
of such alliances is that even isolated people can find global affinities; this 
is not necessarily true of regional organisations.</p> <b></b> 
<p><b>14.4</b> <br>
<b>ALTERNATIVES TO POLITICAL SYSTEMS</b> </p> 
<p>Systems of government are currently based on self- interest, economic 
pragmatism, belief, impractical theory, and power-centred minorities 
(religious, military, capitalist, communist, familial, or criminal).<br>
 
Almost all such groups set up competitive and ) &quot;adversary-orinented&quot; 
systems.</p> 
<p>We need to set about, in an orderly, sensible, and cooperative way, a 
system of replacing power-centred politics and political hierarchies with a far 
more flexible, practical, and information-centred system responsive to research 
and feedback, and with long- term goals of stability. And we need to do this in 
an ethical and non-threatening way, so that the transition to a cooperative 
(versus conflicting) global society is creative (not destructive).</p> 
<p>The world needs a new, non-polarised, and non-contentious politic; one riot 
made possible by those in situations that promote a left-right, black-white, 
capitalist-communist, believer-infidel thinking. Such systems are, like it or 
not, promoting antagonism and destroying cooperation and interdependence. 
Confrontational thinking, operating through political or power systems, has 
destroyed cultural, intellectual, and material resources that could have been 
used, in a life-centred ethic, for earth repair.</p> 
<p>It is possible to agree with most people, of any race or creed, on the 
basics of life-centred ethics and commonsense procedures, across all cultural 
groups; it matters not that one group eats beef, and another</p> 
<p>PAGE 509 </p> 
<p>regards cows as holy, providing they agree to cooperate in areas which are 
of concern to them both, and to respect the origins of their differences as a 
chance of&nbsp; history and evolution, not assessing such differences as due to 
personal perversity.</p> 
<p>It is always possible to use differences creatively, and design to use 
them, not to eliminate one or other group as infidels. Belief is of itself not 
so much a difference as a refusal to admit the existence of differences; this 
easily transposes into the antagonistic attitude of &quot;who is not with me is 
against me&quot; , itself a coercive and illogical attitude and one likely, in 
the extreme, to classify all others as enemies, when they are merely living 
according to their own history and needs.</p> 
<p>Most human communities function in relation to a long-term sustainablility 
only because they do differ from others; what is possible to an Inuit (Eskimo) 
is not possible to a forest pygmy. Thus, it is not differences in themselves 
that are important; it is how all groups relate to the basic rules of the local 
ecology that permit them to function on a long-term basis. Belief, like 
religion, is a basically private and non-global characteristic, and should not 
be subject to comparisons. On close examination, we &quot;believe&quot; in 
those systems that enable us to behave without guilt, with respect to our 
resources and our own culture.</p> 
<p>It has long been apparent that our current political, economic, and landuse 
systems cannot solve such long-term and worsening problems as soil degradation, 
ground water pollution, forest decline, the spread of poverty, unemployment, 
and malnutrition (or its extreme, famine). Despite good scientific prognoses 
and assessments, effective ground strategies are lacking. The temporary nature 
of political systems is an impediment to effective action. We could describe 
all western political systems as those of competing belief elites; whether they 
are self-described as communist, socialist, capitalist, or democratic, they all 
function in ways which are essentially short-term.</p> 
<p>By their nature, political systems seek to impose a policy control over as 
wide an area of influence as possible, are power-centred (not life-centred), 
and are often composed of very few families or (in the case of royalist and 
feudal societies), one family. Thus, the continuing and long-sustained 
programmes necessary to reverse forest loss and soil decline are usually 
sacrificed for the short-term policies of an elite maintaining power. It was 
said of a recent prime minister of Australia that his national policies all 
worked to maximise profits from his farm!</p> 
<p>&quot;The argument for simplicity is never a political argument...when 
people practice it in their lives... they don't even need any politics.&quot; 
(Manas, 17 act 1984). This same statement also refers to the adoption of an 
ethical basis to action, to the placement of money and resources, and to the 
determination to act in accordance with one's beliefs. All of these can occur 
independently of political change, and can be long-term (life-long) personal 
actions of great effect. That is, people can act independently of political 
theory (which rarely, if ever,covers the questions of ethics, simplicity, local 
autonomy, or life-oriented action). Such changes in people come about by 
education and information, and when enough people change, then political 
systems (if they are to survive) may follow, or become as irrelevant as they 
now appear to be in terms of real solutions.</p> 
<p>For this reason, the place to start change is first with the individual 
(oneself), and second in one's region or neighbourhood.</p> <b></b> 
<p><b>THE RIGHT NOT TO BE IN DEBT.</b> </p> 
<p>Some of the most charming and climatically appropriate houses on earth are 
built without bank&nbsp; loans, architects, metals, concrete, or 
contractors.However, in every case they are built in areas where trade unions, 
building surveyors, health officials, and local or state governments do not 
impede the home builder or the community providing shelter for themselves. 
While Chile (as an economic system guided by &quot;experts&quot;) accumulated a 
$12 billion foreign debt in 1985, poor people, acting without loans, together 
built at least $11 billion housing in slum areas by local cooperation without 
incurring any foreign debt. Why is this the case?</p> 
<p>Stone, mud, bamboo, round timbers, rope, thatch, and even baked brick and 
tiles, are the age-old durable building materials of mankind. All can be 
locally produced if energy from community forests and people is provided. Even 
cement and mortar can be made if needed using kilns fired by wood, as can 
pottery,bricks, and roof tiles. None of this needs money if people work 
together.</p> 
<p>The real cause of a lack of shelter (as with food) in any country is not 
that of finance, but of restrictive practices by a regulatory bureaucracy. 
Moreover, state or private ownership (versus community ownership) of forests, 
small mines, and lands is devoted to state or corporate profits to support a 
largely urban, leisured class of bureaucrats, which denies these basic 
biological and earth resources to the very people who work to produce or mine 
them.</p> 
<p>We have had &quot;national service&quot; to fight wars, but I cannot recall 
any but sustainable tribal societies that require every man and every woman to 
help shelter and feed themselves. Curiously, we are drafted to kill strangers, 
and denied the right to preserve life; no armies are created to build houses, 
grow potatoes, or plant forests for the future; unemployment for others is 
preferred by those who choose power as a method of exploitation.</p> 
<p>In very recent societies, our basic &quot;right&quot; is to vote,form 
unions, protest, or go to law (i.e. to support<br>
 professional classes). 
Truly basic rights to grow or protect forests, to build a shelter, grow food, 
or provide water from our roof areas are commonly denied by local or state 
regulations. Effective local group action restores the true basic rights, which 
are those of personal responsibility for our sustenance on earth, and to earth 
itself. While &quot;natural law&quot; demands a fair return for</p> 
<p>(PAGE 510) </p> 
<p>every gift received, the laws of power demand gifts without thought of 
return-this is called &quot;economic growth&quot; and means unlimited resource 
exploitation and the concomitant exploitation of people.</p> 
<p>The wealth of any area lies not in banks or cities, but in those basic 
resources, skills, and natural systems developed by its peoples.</p> <b></b> 
<p><b>POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS.</b> </p> 
<p>There are two ways to ensure the political changes which will bring 
ecological changes. The first is to mobilise ground support in every electorate 
where a candidate of any party takes a stand on good ecology, or against 
nuclear and polluting industry; and the second is to form a local Ecological or 
Green Party, or a&nbsp; bioregional group.</p> 
<p>This would be an easier task if all intentional groups affiliated, and 
subscribed to a common policy; it is difficult for a small group to evolve a 
total policy in isolation, and a common policy statement sums up the skills of 
all groups. Common policy always leaves room , for local issues, but gives 
strong principles for guidance in those issues. As well as a guiding ethic, the 
broad aims of such a party are (as stated in Planet Drum, P.O.Box 31251, San 
Francisco, CA 94131, USA): ecological, socially egalitarian, grassroots 
democratic, and , non-growth. In Germany and other European countries, the 
Green Party has increasing support and representation, with 23 federal and 48 
state seats by 1983. The Green Party's address is Die Grunen, Bundestag, Bonn, 
West Germany. In the USA, International Green Party, 113 29th St., Newport 
Beach, California 92663.</p> <b><i></i></b> <i></i> 
<p><i><b>EVOLVING A NEW POLICY BASE.</b></i> </p> 
<p>A common global policy can start with a general ethic as stated in the 
beginning of this book; it can then proceed to specific policies, for specific 
cultures, regions, and landscapes. To structure such policies, we must search 
out working solutions (e.g. we know that Singapore has solved most housing 
funding problems, that some towns are energy and food self-reliant, and that 
many problems have already been solved in other areas or at other times). Thus, 
the structure under which we should gather common policy is:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Define what is seen to be the problem or concern: give weight to 
priorities on a scale from 1-10.</li> 
<li>State intent of policy for your region; what it is intended to do {the 
principles of this policy).</li> 
<li>Collect strategies that have been proven to work; this really means a set 
of case histories.</li> 
<li>Frame a set of policies based on all successful strategies. </li> </ul> 
<p>Overall, set policy priorities in rough order, weighted for urgency, public 
cost or loss of wealth, general or global spread of the problem, long-term 
effect, and threats to basic resources or life systems. Do not, in the first 
place, try to frame policy on purely local or trivial matters, unless as a case 
history applicable to a broad principle.</p> <b></b> 
<p><b>14.5</b> <br>
<b>BIOREGIONAL ORGANISATION</b> </p> 
<p>A bioregional association is an association of the residents of a natural 
and identifiable region. This region is sometimes defined by a watershed, 
sometimes by remnant or existing tribal or language boundaries, at times by 
town boundaries, suburban streets, or districts, and at times by some 
combination of the above factors. Many people identify with their local region 
or neighbourhood and know its boundaries.</p> 
<p>There is an obvious conflict between the need to live in a region in a 
responsible way (bioregional centrality) and the need to integrate with other 
people in other places (global outreach). We need not only to &quot;think 
globally and act locally&quot;, but to &quot;act and think globally and 
locally&quot;.</p> 
<p>The region is our home address, the place where we develop our culture, and 
take part in bioregional networks. Through global associations and 
&quot;families of common interest&quot; we cross not only the regional but also 
state and national borders to set up multicultural alliances.</p> 
<p>Just as bioregions need a federal congress periodically, so do they 
occasionally need global congresses; societies or families also need global 
meetings to break down the idea of defended regional boundaries to humanity. 
Ethics and principles of self-governance, interdependence, and voluntary 
simplicity or restriction of human numbers on earth still apply at regional and 
outreach levels. Intermarriage, visits, mutual trade and aid, skills exchange, 
and educational exchange between regions of very different cultures enriches 
both. This is the antithesis of &quot;integration&quot; (bureaucratic genocide) 
that is promulgated by majority groups who disallow language use and cultural 
life to minorities. In particular, reciprocal education values both sets of 
knowledge and world concepts, and respects others' lifestyles.</p> 
<p>Tribal maps often defined bioregions very well; totems and 
&quot;skins&quot; (clan groups) of tribes might take, as their totemic mothers, 
a particular tree or animal, which itself was limited in distribution by the 
sum of topographic and climatic factors. Other groups occupied ecologies of 
grasslands, stony deserts, swamps, or mountain ridges. Today, minority language 
groups (Saamen, Basque, Pitjatjantjara) claim territories that are ancient, and 
specific to their life mode. Obviously, cities break up into different, often 
occupational or income, districts, each with its own dialect and ecology, 
consumption spectrum, and morality. The acid test of a bioregion is that it is 
recognised as such by its inhabitants.</p> 
<p>Ideally, the region so defined can be limited to that occupied by from 7000 
to 40,000 people.Of&nbsp; these,</p> 
<p>(PAGE511) </p> 
<p>perhaps only a hundred will be initially interested in any regional 
association, and even less will be active in it. The work of the bioregional 
group is to assess the natural, technical, service, and financial resources of 
the region, and to identify areas where leakage of resources (water, soil, 
money, talent) leave the region. This quickly points the way to local 
self-reliance strategies.</p> 
<p>People can be called on to write accounts of their specialities, as they 
apply to the region, and regional news sheets publish results as they come in. 
Once areas of action have been defined, regional groups can be formed into 
associations dealing with specific areas, eg.:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Food: Consumer-producer associations and&nbsp; gardening or soil societies 
</li> 
<li>Shelter: Owner-builder associations </li> 
<li>Energy: Appropriate technology associations </li> 
<li>Finance: An &quot;earthbank&quot; association </li> </ul> 
<p>And so on...for crafts, music, markets, livestock, and&nbsp; nature study 
or any other interest. The job of the bioregional office is complex, and it 
needs 4-6 people to act as consultants and coordinators, with others on call 
when needed. All other associations can use the office for any necessary 
registration, address, phone, and newsletter services, and pay a fee for usage.
</p> 
<p>Critical services and links can be built by any regional office; it can 
serve as a land access centre, operating the strategies outlined later under 
that section. It can also act as leasehold and title register, or to service 
agreements for clubs and societies. More importantly, the regional office can 
offer and house community self-funding schemes, and collect monies for trusts 
and societies.</p> 
<p>The regional office also serves as a contact centre to other regions, and 
thus as a trade or coordination centre. One regional office makes it very easy 
for any resident or visitor to contact all services and associations offering 
in the region, and also greatly reduces costs of communication for all groups. 
An accountant on call can handily contract to service many groups.The regional 
group can also invite craftspeople or lecturers to address interest groups 
locally, sharing income from this educational enterprise.</p> 
<p>Some of the topics that can be included in the regional directory are as 
follows. These can be taken topic by topic, sold at first by the page, and 
finally put together as a looseleaf notebook (volunteers enter local resource 
centres and addresses under each category; the system is best suited to 
computer retrieval). The following Resource Index for Bioregions has been 
compiled by Maxine Cole and myself for the Northern Rivers Bioregional 
Association of New South Wales, Australia.</p> 
<p>The primary categories are as follows: <br>
 A. Food and food support 
systems<br>
 B. Shelter and buildings <br>
 C. Livelihoods and support services 
<br> D. Information, media, communication, and research <br>
 E. Community and 
security<br>

<b>Note</b> that if essential

there is immediately obvious a category of &quot;jobs vacant&quot;. If, in 
addition, there is a modest investment or funding organisation set up (itself a 
job), then capital to train and equip people to fill these gaps is also 
available. When basic needs are supplied locally, research and skills will 
reveal work in producing excess for trade this excess can be as information and 
education to other regions.</p> 
<p>(PAGE514) </p> 
<p>Bioregionalism is an excellent concept, given the&nbsp; irrational land use 
systems and land divisions developed by the present power structures. However, 
it is rarely an achievable reality, unless enough people gather in one area and 
manage to attract a sufficient number of like people to achieve a viable 
internal economy and trade infrastructure, together with the community common 
funds that make such enterprises possible.</p> 
<p>And that is the secret of success: assembling sufficient commonsense people 
in one area. If we are one isolated a biodynamic gardener in a district of 
contract vegetable growers or graziers trained in chemical agriculture, we find 
both the practice and infrastructure support of the isolated system difficult; 
there may be no one to talk to, let alone share resources with. On the other 
hand, as land titles in a region are bought out and occupied by any group who 
share an ethical philosophy, so the shops, markets, processing centres, 
equipment, and , support services for the new economy become&nbsp; worthwhile 
and available.</p> 
<p>As much as &quot;the will to do&quot; indicates health in the individual, 
so an increasing biological resource indicates health in the community. Every 
bioregion should monitor tree cover, wildlife, seaweed beds, bird colonies, 
species counts, and productive cultivated land at regular intervals. If these 
have increased in yield and maintained in species, the area maintains health. 
If no increase, or a decrease, is evident, something is wrong and should be 
immediately assessed for correction.</p> 
<p>It is only the increase in the variety, quantity, and health of natural 
systems that indicates the health of any area. Where species disappear, trees 
or fish die, farmland and forest yields are reduced, and species lists 
simplify, there is trouble, and a degenerative effect is operating. A 
&quot;life census&quot; needs to be compiled every 2-5 years, and some data 
needs continual records, as absences are harder to detect than presences. 
Modifications to habitat can result in a constantly increasing biological 
resource, both qualitatively and&nbsp; quantitatively.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;Every region needs to act as a curator and refuge for some critical 
life elements of allied regions, so that&nbsp; absolute loss of species is 
unlikely short of global catastrophe. In some land trusts, it is this 
biological-environmental accounting which sets the basis for the &quot;economic 
rent&quot;, and (in the event of a degenerative trend) even the basis for 
continuing in occupation and use of the land.</p> <b></b> 
<p><b>14.6</b> <br>
<b>EXTENDED FAMILIES</b> </p> 
<p>Chiajen (the family): The family is society in embryo; it is the native 
soil on which the performance of moral duty is made easy through natural 
affection, so that within the family circle a basis of moral practice is 
updated; this is later widened to include human relationships and society in 
general.<br>
 (From The I Ching) </p> 
<p>The concepts of village and bioregion refer to a base or home area, but 
today many people travel about. Many societies extend as close affinity groups 
across many nations, thus forming a non-national network. Such groups develop a 
familial, rather than a competitive or conflicting, inter-relationship. With a 
common interest and ethical base, cooperative interdependence supplants 
competition. A &quot;family&quot; of this type, with 1 ,000 or less members, 
can ally with like groups to create a tribe, and 20-40 such tribes form a 
nation. Families, unlike many societies, have child care and the welfare of 
their members at heart.</p> 
<p>Such families already exist in Europe, with small groups living in a 
scatter of households and locations across many existing national boundaries; 
some have existed for 18 or more years, and members report individual 
satisfaction with a larger support group. In practice, any person has 3-5 close 
friends (who change slowly over time), a support group of 30 or more 
acquaintances, and resource access to the whole system. A familial system of 
shared ethics can:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>&nbsp;Keep in touch via a registrar and news service; </li> 
<li>Co-invest in family property development and joint enterprises </li> 
<li>Rationalise reources for most efficient sharing of space and equipment; 
</li> 
<li>Develop a series of social contacts via visits; </li> 
<li>Care for the children as one group, and set up a fund for their needs; 
</li> 
<li>Widen the cultural and support base for households. </li> </ul> 
<p>Membership in a family of shared ethical values does not conflict with any 
other membership or duties, and is mainly a matter of organisation of a family 
registrar and some common funds. Such families need to define each adult as an 
individual, with a right to the essentials of their own space (bed and work 
space), garden, and occupation. As nuclear family households are a minor part 
of modern societies (13-18% of all&nbsp; households), households based on 
friendship, or work affinity, or designed for students, single, or 
elderly&nbsp; people, are needed.</p> 
<p>Like land ownership, the ownership of people is an illusory aim. Some 
couples can tolerate years of close work, but many might prefer a slightly more 
independent existence, close to but not necessarily living with each other.</p> 
<p>In particular, children need a wider alliance and support group than just 
one or two parents. People can find &quot;aunts and uncles&quot; to take part 
of the responsibility for children in any such extended family, and if the 
children have a common fund (like their own credit union) for basic needs, then 
their care at a basic level is assured. They also have more than one household 
to relate to, or to visit or dwell in when educational needs&nbsp; change.</p> 
<p>PAGE515 </p> 
<p>Families can, for instance, maintain a student dormitory near secondary or 
tertiary institutes, whereas<br>
 at present many rural families have no such 
facility to send children ages 12 or over when they need or request higher 
education.</p> 
<p>People can feel, and sometimes are, trapped in the&nbsp; nuclear family or 
the &quot;compound&quot; family of blood relatives who may share no ethical or 
interest base. At times, traditional extended families grossly exploit (in 
particular) younger women, as household serfs, or are exploited by indolent 
members. Blood relationship is no guarantee of freedom of choice, or fair 
dealing. Besides, as people grow and age, they develop differing needs for 
space and -relationships, and other (intellectual or interest) factors call for 
different personal relationships.</p> 
<p>Many of us have been locked in to unsatisfactory work or personal 
relationships, or too much alone in<br>
 the context of nuclear family 
&quot;ideals&quot; , which in real societies are for the few. It is good to be 
able to visit, stay with, and cooperate with a few households and to form new 
relationships as needed; it is also necessary to have the freedom to choose new 
work alliances.</p> 
<p>In the extended family, problems such as lack of shelter, land access, 
access to capital and services, deserted or neglected children (or adults), 
transmission of infective diseases, and population control can largely be dealt 
with by internal behaviour on some ideal of (dynamic) stability. By selective 
recruitment, skills and resources can be acquired, or developed by education 
and group capital investment. Funds can be established as follows:<br>
<b>.</b>
COMMON ENTERPRISE FUND: the family fund, held in 2-3 places and convertible to 
a variety of currencies, and managed by a few individuals as a J full-time job. 
All savings and contributions are&nbsp; accounted to individuals, and available 
as loans as for any credit union or revolving fund, across all currencies and 
regions.<br>
<b>.</b>ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP FUND: invested and the interest used. 
This services the registry, newsletter, and pays part or full-time wages to a 
collator.<br>
<b>.</b>CHILDRENS'&nbsp; PERMANENT FUND: all adults (age 17 or 
over) contribute $50 to this fund, with additional gifts encouraged. The fund 
is managed with the Common Enterprise Fund for essential&nbsp; child-oriented 
ventures or for education. This is a non-returnable fund. Each mother or 
mother-to-be would encourage 5-6 support people to contribute donations, and 
agree to help in other ways. Until age 12, parents can apply for loans, and 
thereafter (until age 17) the children can themselves apply, after which they 
are cognised as adults.<br>
<b>&nbsp;.</b>SPECIAL VENTURE FUNDS: to be raised 
by proposal, open to groups or individuals, and handled by the Common 
Enterprise Fund administrators for&nbsp; such group ventures as a shared house, 
boat, overseas programme, or business.</p> 
<p>It is probable that some (or all) members could run one or more enterprises 
to fund a charity or &quot;trust-in aid&quot; programme for areas of need. 
Given such basic financial tools, secondary needs are to rationalise resources 
as a type of real estate service and resource listing internally, so that all 
members can assist others as producers, consumers, trustees, or by land, 
appliance, and shelter rationalisation.</p> 
<p>As some ideal, groups of 30 or so people could gather in core regions (with 
some outlier households) and so make travel locally an easier affair. Meta- 
networking (tribe to tribe) enables such higher-Ievel organisations as travel 
and accommodation nets to be set up on a global basis, cash to be transferred 
to areas of need, and larger joint enterprises developed.</p> 
<p>As for the touchy subject of population control, taking group 
responsibility for a very few children sometimes cures the urge to breed, and 
those who want more than two children are far outnumbered by those who don't, 
so that where children are not seen as a &quot;future insurance&quot;-as in 
very poor rural families- the population can soon achieve a steady state. The 
schematic of<b>Figure 14.1</b> gives the basic parameters for both steady-state 
and out-of-control or declining populations. A registry can therefore inform 
people of the balances in sex ratio and age structure, and recruitment in the 
late stages of enrolment can be adjusted to give a fair balance of sex-age 
distribution. It does not matter, of course, if perfect balances are not 
achieved, but resources remain plentiful only if people remain relatively few.
</p> 
<p>Given an extended family, a bioregional network locally, and some form of 
common work opportunity, any individual is assured of access to resources, 
capital, cultural exchanges, and good work. We need not only fixed villages and 
bioregions, but open corridors to other regions, other people, and across 
nations.</p> 
<p>As I see it, conflict arises on &quot;national&quot; boundaries that are 
fixed or disputed. A web of. multi-racial, multi-cultural, and 
multi-occupational families and global nations obliterates these &quot;defended 
territories&quot; and suits peaceful lifestyles. The framework for such nations 
already exists; it remains to give those frameworks the mechanisms that create 
true interdependence via anew type of extended family.</p> 
<p>We all value cultural and environmental diversity-or the world would become 
one vast Toyota-Coca Cola-McDonald-Hilton monoculture. Thus the concepts of 
unique bioregions, intact language and culture, and cross-cultural enrichment 
is central to a permaculture of human resources, and an ecumenical global 
nation.</p> <b></b> 
<p><b>14.7</b> <br>
<b>TRUSTS AND LEGAL STRATEGIES</b> </p> 
<p>Trusts in the public interest are the legal basis on which churches, 
universities and many schools, research</p> 
<p>(PAGE 516) <br>
 (PAGE 517) </p> 
<p>establishments, some hospitals, many public services, aid programmes, and 
charities rest. Few people realise how many, and how varied, are the trusts 
that serve them in one or other way. About 18-20% of businesses may also be 
non-profit trusts owned or operated by the charitable trusts that benefit from 
(are beneficiaries of) them.</p> 
<p>It is quite possible, even sensible, to completely replace the bureaucracy 
of public services with a series of locally administered trusts, and Holland 
(in particular) largely supplants expensive paid public services (burdened as 
they are with heavy salary and capital costs, and .liable to inaction, 
self-interest, and executive inefficiency) to publicly formed trusts (called 
stichtings). In the case of any small country, such trusts can run all public 
operations, and the &quot;government&quot; becomes simply a way of conveying 
tax capital back to the regions via local trusts. However, trusts can 
also&nbsp; self-fund via non-profit businesses to become foundations, fully 
equipped with their own income&nbsp; sources.</p> 
<p>Trusts are usually formed, operated, and staffed by people (often initially 
volunteers) motivated to perform one or other public duty, or who seek to 
assist a defined or special group in need. Such trusts often have names 
including the words: church, foundation, institute, communion, school, 
congregation, charity, bureau, trust, or even company. When the trusts are 
formed to trade, they can take or own any business name that suits their work; 
such businesses are administered by a trustee.</p> 
<p>Trusts are formed just to conduct businesses and trade, giving away their 
profits annually to named beneficiaries. If the beneficiaries are individuals, 
such gifts are taxed as private income; if the beneficiaries are charitable 
trusts or churches, the gift is not only not taxable but can be tax deductible 
to any giver. Trading, or &quot;unit discretionary&quot; , trusts are also 
known as&nbsp; non-profit corporations (not to be confused with for-profit 
organisations).</p> 
<p>Many large companies set up, and to some extent fund, non-profit 
organisations or even charitable trusts as a means to reduce taxable income, to 
carry out educational services, or to obtain public goodwill; some businesses 
tithe to worthy trusts that they believe in (a tithe is usually a tenth of 
income, but in practice ranges 4 from 5-15%).</p> 
<p>Legally, a trust body consists of a TRUSTEE and and document or TRUST DEED, 
registered with the public ompany registrar. There are many good reasons 
to&nbsp; make the trustee a private company, as directors of such&nbsp; 
companies need to be few in number (3 or 4 are E enough), can appoint others if 
one dies or resigns, and&nbsp; can be anonymous. A company does not die, unlike 
its directors, and the small group of trustees can act quickly and decisively 
without reference to the cumbersome and often uninvolved &quot;board of 
directors&quot; that some trusts have appointed. It is wise to 
restrict&nbsp;&nbsp; directorships of a trustee company to those who are e very 
active in trust affairs, and preferably live close to each other in one region. 
Such a set-up is diagrammed in<b>Figure 14.3.</b> </p> 
<p>Should any person wish to set up a trust, the very first thing to do is to 
closely define the purposes of the trust, the group to whom it will apply 
(&quot;all the citizens ...of Australia&quot; or &quot;those suffering from 
spina bifida&quot;), and to instruct a lawyer to draw up the trust deed and to 
register this and the trustee company.</p> 
<p>It is usually possible to buy a copy the trust deeds of other ethical 
organisations, and to use these as a model for a local trust, so reducing legal 
costs. Some law societies service ethical trusts at no charge for their time.
</p> 
<p>Any trust can have (unregistered, no cost) an ASSOCIATION of volunteers, 
aides, or clients who can publish a newsletter and generally assist the trust 
in its affairs.</p> 
<p>It is also very wise for any charitable trust to establish a non-profit 
trading (business) trust to help finance its activities, and this trading trust 
can refund costs to volunteers, pay wages, and gift profits to the charity or 
to any other charity. Thus, if the charitable trust is TRUST A, and the trading 
trust is TRUST B, the system as a whole works as per<b>Figure 14.4.</b> </p> 
<p>The trust deeds state not only the purposes of the trusts but in addition 
the &quot;will&quot; of the trust is usually included, leaving its assets to an 
allied trust if this trust completes operations, closes down, or fails from 
lack of interest or of funds. Also, the trust deed gives an estimate of the 
duration of the trust; if this is intended to be &quot;forever&quot; , then 
legally the statement is likely to be , on the lines of &quot;until 21 years 
after the death of the last descendant of Ming emperors&quot; or some such 
legally indefinable period.</p> 
<p>Trusts are durable, efficient, easy to administer, and of great public 
service; everybody should be associated with one! There are several small 
independent but cooperative Permaculture Institutes and allied groups , in 
existence which have associated non-profit trusts operating businesses to fund 
them; in this way, many trusts are independent of gifts or grants, and become 
self-reliant for funds. It is estimated that France has 100,000 public interest 
groups, each with its own areas of interest and subscribers, and that about 
10,000 form up annually; one can only suppose that others also fade out, their 
work redundant or completed.</p> 
<p>As so few (dedicated) people can operate a trust effectively, it is far 
better to set up many such local trusts than to risk the power-centred 
inefficiences of a monstrous hierarchical system, such as some religious sects 
and foundations have become. These are essentially fossilised and no longer of 
relevance to ordinary people. Every dissenter or group of dissenters should 
therefore set up trusts to promulgate their own views, or form an independent 
trust in a cooperative network of like trusts.</p> 
<p>Unless the formation of trusts is a common practice in a particular 
country, very few lawyers can set up (or even know about) trusts. They often 
give bad advice to groups, setting up litigious or cumbersome systems,</p> 
<p>PAGE 518&nbsp; </p> 
<p>giving endless trouble and necessitating agreement among many people (an 
end which is, in practice, impossible to honestly attain), and which involves 
distasteful accomodations and compromises, explicit or hidden. Therefore, a 
careful search for the right lawyer is essential (corporate lawyers are often 
knowledgeable about trusts).</p> 
<p>Other simple legal structures necessary to companies, cooperatives, credit 
unions, public investment trusts and so on are all well-outlined in company 
law, have excellent support services, and are routine arrangements. A good 
accountant to lay out the bookkeeping and give advice is necessary, as is an 
efficient office manager to communicate with the trusts's target population.</p>

<b>DEVELOPMENT AND PROPERTY TRUSTS</b> <br>
 (Appropriate 
to village development, land rehabilitation)</p> 
<p>No investment in glamour stocks (coal, oil, uranium, city properties, paper 
pulp, agrochemicals, mining) is likely to yield anything to us but more 
pollution and to hasten global collapse. The evidence on acid rain alone (well 
documented) will convince any more person that further &quot; progress and 
development&quot; will cause social and environmental upheaval.</p> 
<p>We need to turn our money resources to truly rehabilitative ends. We accept 
the need, therefore, for accelerated reafforestation, the preservation of 
existing forests, sane village development, and the rehabilitation of eroded 
and misused lands.</p> 
<p>PAGE 519 </p> 
<p>In forming a development trust, our aims are not just financial, but also 
ensure community survival by community involvement. With good management and 
skillful work, there is no reason why this should not also pay for itself, or 
show a financial advantage to investors. It is an invaluable experience to 
model such a property trust, and to teach others how to follow any successes 
that we achieve.</p> 
<p>A property trust purchases real estate for improvement, lease, or rental on 
behalf of many small investors who cannot afford to individually own or develop 
such properties. By improving properties so purchased, their value increases, 
and (under present rulings) taxation is not incurred on that increase in value 
if the property is held for 10 or more years, nor is the trust itself taxed on 
its income from investors. A &quot;small business centre&quot; can be a 
property trust. Many such trusts concentrate on city office properties or rural 
monocultures; we can&nbsp; concentrate on other aspects of property investment, 
as outlined herein for village development, or land&nbsp; rehabilitation 
systems.</p> 
<p>The management group obtains backing from investors (via a public 
prospectus) to float a Property&nbsp; Trust on the investment market. The prime 
purpose is to give every person a chance to do more than object to or protest 
inappropriate land sales to overseas investors, land misuse, and poor planning, 
and to&nbsp; invest in saving critical or endangered national&nbsp; resources 
(such as wildlife and forests), while actively; rehabilitating eroded lands.</p>
<p>In the first trust of this type, the aim can be to stop accepting investors 
at $2-5 million, which will develop a property or properties as listed in the 
prospectus. A low unit price ($100) enables even poorer people to invest; a 
single unit can be held by a partnership, society, or other corporate group so 
that even less money need be contributed per person in order to assist (e.g.) 
unemployed people. There need be no limit to the number of units held by any 
person.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;Unlike other property trusts, investors should be given every 
opportunity to involve themselves in their<br>
 investments via on-site work, 
consultancy, leaseholds, tree nursery supply, preference in sales of titles in 
villages, access to products or services, and (controlled) recreational access 
to lands and buildings. The trust can inform investors of any opportunity for 
their involvement at any level from volunteer or recreational use to paid 
consultancy, building, or in leaseholds available.</p> 
<p>Funds can be used for the following: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>To set up the trust deed and management company; </li> 
<li>To pay for the work of the trustee; </li> 
<li>To pay management a retainer for their work; and </li> 
<li>To pay for normal running costs of the trust, including office expenses, 
printing, bookkeeping,&nbsp;&nbsp; accounting, valuation, and the travel of 
management to properties.</li> </ul> 
<p>The precise amount so used should not exceed 4-8% of funds (based on 
figures from other property trust expenses), and the remainder is devoted to 
the purchase and development of properties as outlined in the prospectus. Costs 
reduce as trust income grows.</p> 
<p>Any surplus or unused funds accumulating in the trust can be invested in 
ethical systems, including housing cooperatives, inventory for development 
projects, and shares in ethical businesses.</p> 
<p>The specific project areas in which ethical trusts operate are: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Purchase of threatened wildlife and forest habitat (usually with a 
specific plant or animal group in mind). Managed for the aims stated in a 
specific prospectus.</li> 
<li>Purchase and development of eroded, salted, deforested, or misused land 
for rehabilitation.</li> 
<li>Development of an energy-efficient, sustainable village on trust lands, 
for sale as developed, or pre-sale to raise capital for development.</li> 
<li>Special interest/ group developments such as trout fisheries, aquaculture, 
or seed orchards for lease or sale.</li> 
<li>Bioregional development as purchase of community resources in a specific 
region(s) for use by residents, community groups, trust unit holders, or by 
residents buying trust properties in that area.</li> 
<li>Purchase of selected properties for assisting developing countries 
(overseas outposts).</li> 
<li>Bioregional clean energy systems or clean transport methods. </li> </ul> 
<p>The way such trusts stage development and show a return is as in Figure 
14.5.<br>
 &nbsp; </p> <b></b> 
<p><b>14.9</b> <br>
<b>VILLAGE DEVELOPMENT</b> </p> 
<p>As individual designers gain field or applied skills in house, energy 
system, and property design, and as ethical investment comes of age, the idea 
of &quot;client work&quot; can be joined to that of earth repair, and to real 
estate development. In order to do this, finance managers need to join forces 
with good managerial or design groups. The whole development group thus evolved 
can then purchase lands, capitalise them, and get them in order as a complex of 
lake, forest, and village settlement. We need well-designed villages today more 
than any other enterprise: villages to re-locate those soon-to-be-refugees from 
sea-level rise, villages to house people from urban slums, and villages where 
people of like mind can find someone else to talk to and to work with.</p> 
<p>Villages can pool their surplus or current financial resources in a 
developmental credit union, and create land titles to sell in order to develop 
public service facilities. Nobody need pretend all problems are 
solved-conspicuous consumption can still ruin the idea of energy 
self-reliance--but with good management, the plan that follows comes very close 
to a sane village development.</p> 
<p>An intentional village should have a group ethic acceptable to all who come 
there. Ethics, if shared,<br>
 &nbsp; </p> 
<p>PAGE 520 - <br>
 &nbsp; </p> 
<p>PAGE 521 </p> 
<p>discussed, and acknowledged, give unity to groups, villages, and nations, 
indicate a way to go, and control our use of earth resources. They can be 
reflected in our legal, financial, domestic, and public lives.<br>
 &nbsp;The 
aims of a sensible village group might be to:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>REDUCE THE NEED TO EARN, by developing food, energy, and shelter 
self-reliance;</li> 
<li>EARN WITHIN THE VILLAGE IF POSSIBLE, reducing transport and travel needs; 
thus to recruit people who could fill most essential village occupations, or 
who are self-employed;</li> 
<li>PRODUCE A SURPLUS from services to others, thus maintaining a strong 
economy and outreach potential;</li> 
<li>PROVIDE MANY OF THE NON-MATERIAL NEEDS of people, perhaps of children in 
particular, by devising meaningful work, relevant education, and a rich natural 
environment; and</li> 
<li>COOPERATE in various enterprises and small associations. </li> </ul> 
<p>A village can provide PRIVACY in homes and gardens; ACCESS TO TOOLS as 
leased, rented, or easily accessed equipment from computers to tractors; 
ENTERTAINMENT from local folk groups to video cassettes; CONSERVATION as a 
village wildlife, water, and forest reserve, and RECREATION in the near 
environment. It can also provide the BASIC LIFE ESSENTIALS of shelter, food, 
and energy.</p> 
<p>No isolated or scattered group of people can self provide for the above, 
but it is probable that about 30 to 200 houses can support these services and 
basic facilities, especially if there is planning for cooperative funding. What 
is easy for a group may be impossibly stressful for a nuclear family. It is 
possible for a group to provide many services, and for many people to earn a 
living in so doing.</p> 
<p>It is quite practical to create such new villages without much initial 
capital in the actual development phase. This can be achieved in these ways:</p>
<ul> 
<li>By receiving a gift of land to a land trust, intended for village 
development.</li> 
<li>To find suitable land for sale, and to take out an option to buy from the 
owner, dependent on pre--sale of the idea to buyers.</li> 
<li>To work on tribal or trust lands already communally owned. </li> 
<li>T o work with an investor or finance group to purchase land for village 
development, and to stage the development.</li> 
<li>To convene a group which wants such a village and use their capital to 
stage a village development.</li> </ul> 
<p>The first few of these options presume a developer, are faster, and 
probably easier than the last option. All, however, need careful forward 
planning. The development may give considerable profit (but that is not 
guaranteed). In fact, fair or normal profits can be used to benefit both people 
and land, can give young or poorer people titles, and can rehabilitate 
landscapes otherwise neglected.</p> 
<p>As a guide, 30% of titles available should cover (in value) all land and 
development costs, so that surplus titles are available for community access, 
profits, gifts, labour equity, and new project development. Land should be 
priced to local real estate values, and only very poor management would then 
show a loss on development.<br>
 For example! for 100 titles in the village: 
<br> Development Stage: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>60% are sold by the development group to a village group at best prices 
(30% of that covers all costs, and actually sets the land price);</li> 
<li>30% are given to the village group for later use; </li> 
<li>10% are allotted by the developers as labour equity to such people as 
surveyors, earthmovers, landscapers.</li> </ul> 
<p>Village Trust Stage (the titles given to the village group by the 
developer):</p> 
<ul> 
<li>20% are sold by the village trust to fund village projects, and can be 
sold at lower (50% or less) value to low-income families;</li> 
<li>10% are reserved for sale to crucial new recruits, e.g. medical, computer, 
energy-producing people.</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OR </p> 
<ul> 
<li>10% issued on easy terms to low-income families; </li> 
<li>20% sold to finance village services. </li> </ul> 
<p>SITE CRITERIA FOR VILLAGE DEVELOPMENT <br>
 There are a variety of 
locations that can be used for village development:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>TYPE 1. In a city block or suburbs. </li> 
<li>TYPE 2. Adjoining an existing village. </li> 
<li>TYPE 3. Within a part-vacant village. </li> 
<li>TYPE 4. Isolated from any existing integrated settlement. </li> 
<li>TYPE 5. On the site of a pre-existing but now vacant or destroyed village. 
</li> 
<li>TYPE 6. As a new suburban development. </li> 
<li>TYPE 7. Specialised settlements on coasts or near wilderness. </li> </ul> 
<p>All need a different real estate and planning approach, so that Type 2 and 
Types 4 to 6 are probably outright purchase or option systems; Types 1 and 3 
are part of a gradual takeover or buy-in system over some years; and Types 2 
and 6 may have both factors operating at once, i.e. some land is purchased for 
development, while older village resources are also purchased for use. Type 4 
is the pioneering or kibbutz approach and needs the most intensive planning, 
especially for water resources, access to market, and specified enterprises.</p>
<p>Type 2 is probably the easiest to plan and administer, and allows a whole 
graduation of involvement and committment. It also attaches to pre-existing 
essential services, although these are unlikely to be as useful or appropriate 
as those indicated here. Purchase of existing homes and lots results in little 
delay in the pioneering stage.</p> 
<p>While the site choice may be very much influenced by opportunity, a 
criteria that is essential is that any village should be able to catch, store, 
reticulate, and</p> 
<p>PAGE 522 </p> 
<p>clean up its own water supply. It is also advantageous&nbsp; that wood, 
wind, solar, or high-pressure water is available for energy production, and 
that clear ideas of&nbsp; how clean energy can be obtained, or developed and 
maintained, is part of the design.</p> 
<p>Likewise, road, rail, boat, and not-too-distant air access are also 
advantageous for trade and travel.<br>
 Computer and telecommunications will 
enable most villages to be in a data network, but real--object trade needs 
transport.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;Finally, one cannot stress too much the factor of mixed ecologies. 
Any village which has access to or can develop forest, aquatic, marine, 
agricultural, and market areas has many more options open to it than a village 
marooned in a simple ecology.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;Procedural Stages to Follow <br>
 I. Formation of a group or location 
of a site.<br>
 2. Arrange site option or purchase terms. Options are cheaper, 
often as little as, e.g. $50 per year for several&nbsp; years if the price 
offered is about 20-30% of the&nbsp; developed site value. The seller may 
retain a house title on the land if so required, and the price is then 
discounted.<br>
 3. Obtain an &quot;agreement in principle&quot; from the local 
shire or planning authority, establishing:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Road type needed, e.g. gravel or sealed; </li> 
<li>Number of allottments allowed in the cluster or per acre; </li> 
<li>What services the developer must provide; </li> 
<li>The stages of development, if the shire requires building to be completed 
in stages.</li> </ul> 
<p>4. Do careful sums, establishing prices based on roading, water supply, and 
sewerage.<br>
 5. Prepare a detailed and careful site plan and proposal for the 
village.<br>
 6. Convene, by advertisement, prospective customers&nbsp; and 
obtain firm commitments. Issue the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proposal and site plan.<br>
 7. Obtain sealed permission for subdivision from the local authority.<br>
 8. 
Sell to prospective buyers, using a trust fund for road, water, and site 
preparation.<br>
 9. When costs are cleared, decide on future projects from 
profits and skills gained.<br>
 There are various ways to finance the process: 
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Developer has all funds for survey and plans. </li> 
<li>Developer raises funds for proposal from investors. </li> 
<li>Potential buyers form a trust account to purchase and develop the land. 
</li> </ul> 
<p>Some mix of the first two is possible, with trust funds established by the 
developers. These funds can be released when the development is fully approved 
by the shire council, and roading and services can be installed at those stages 
that may be demanded by the shire or region.</p> 
<p>There are appropriate legal structures for a village.The developer needs to 
set up a trust (Trust A)-a land bank-to hold commons (village land) for the 
common good and for later development. Here, the developer acts as a foundation 
director (settlor), and should retire as soon as the site has 10-12 residents, 
who then assume directorship of the trust lands and cash assets for the village 
(about 3-4 directors are enough).</p> 
<p>Residents should, as early as possible, set up a separate unit 
discretionary trust (Trust B) for trading operations. Such trusts are currently 
immune from company tax; they also reduce family tax and enable a wide variety 
of enterprises to be initiated by one organisation.</p> 
<p>The essentials of Trust A are that it holds assets for the public good, 
does not take risks, and leases or rents to Trust B, which does trade and take 
risks, and has Trust A as one of its beneficiaries. Trust B can duplicate or 
triplicate itself to accommodate new enterprises and to insulate from risk 
those successful operations which may later develop. It can also handle 
financial systems such as leasing and lending units.</p> 
<p>Although cluster and strata titles give privacy, negotiability, and 
autonomy to individuals and families, and titles and houses can be resold, 
traded, or given to Trust A, it is necessary to set up a land trust if only to 
administer the common lands, recreation reserves, and sites for future 
structures such as schools, restaurants, machine shops, or primary production.
</p> 
<p>In fact, as soon as possible after the developers pay land and 
developmental costs, they should seek to have village trustees elected. As the 
current costs of such trusts are minor in the total, and as they are so useful 
in planning and in income-earning, they should be part of all new village 
design. It is superfluous and unwieldly to have any more than 3 or 4 trustees 
for each trust, although small sub-committees can also be allotted part of any 
specific project work, and other people can contribute their special skills.</p>
<p>The developmental group works best as a small core of 2-4 people, each with 
special skills such as real estate, design, planning, or law. Surveyors, road 
builders, builders, and landscapers are usually locally available for such 
projects. (Although these may also be developers, some contractors will work 
for equity in the project either as village occupants, or for resale at a later 
date.)</p> 
<p>The development group should hand over a site design and user's manual to 
the directors of Trust A, who can display and circulate the initial design, 
record changes and modifications, and keep clear the essential land areas for 
productive use. Of course, all initial designs are made to be changed. The 
challenge is to change the design for the better! A design gives a starting 
point, not an end point.</p> 
<p>Size of Villages <br>
 Human settlements vary in their ability to provide 
resources, to develop a high degree of self-reliance, and in their alienating 
or(conversely) neighbourly behaviour according to population size and function. 
At about 100 income-producing people, a significant financial institution can 
be village-based; at about 500 all people can know each other if social affairs 
are</p> 
<p>PAGE 523 <br>
<br>
 &nbsp; </p> 
<p>organised from time to time. </p> 
<p>At 2,000 people, theft and competitiveness is more common, and sects set up 
in opposition-the 'ecumenial alliances&quot; are lost. Perhaps we should start 
small, at about 30 or so adults, build to 200-300 people, and proceed slowly 
and by choice to 500, then &quot;calve&quot; into new neighbourhoods or new 
villages.</p> 
<p>However, alliances of 200-500 household-size hamlets can make a very viable 
manufacturing or trading alliance and maintain a safe genetic base. Many tribes 
of 200 or so confederate to alliances of 4,000-7,000 in this way, share special 
products by trade, or arrange out-marriages. Thus, pioneer villages can seek 
alliances with others for the common good.</p> 
<p>The Mondragon Cooperatives of Spain at first grew large (3,000-5,000), but 
later reduced to cooperatives of 300-500 to preserve the identity of every 
individual. Nevertheless, a group of such small cooperatives can make any 
vehicle or machine if each produces apart, and this is in fact organised by the 
smaller cooperatives in the Mondragon system.</p> 
<p>In my view, the neighbourhood factor-knowledge of each other's names-is a 
primary factor, and has proved to be a major factor in survival in disaster, as 
assessed (e.g.) in the 1967 Hobart fires, where casualties in 
&quot;anonymous&quot; areas and commuter suburbs were many times higher than in 
neighbourhoods where people knew and cared for others.</p> 
<p>Land Allotment and Village Infrastructure <br>
 Infrastructures for energy, 
commerce, and land allotment are an integral part of a self-reliant village. 
Few villages own all of these, however, and new villages need to reserve off 
land and areas for future&nbsp; priority development of both structures and 
primary product areas. A general plan of these resources must be published for 
all participants.</p> 
<p>The following areas can be reserved for future use: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>School, seminar, and workshop rooms, computers, library, artwork, some 
crafts areas.</li> 
<li>Food processing centre, cafe, coffee shop, home baked goods, some 
commercial or surplus sale products.</li> 
<li>Noisy/oily work, woodwork, metal-work, machine shop, repairs, bulk fuels 
and oils, grease, air pump, vehicle service.</li> 
<li>Retail shops (including plant nursery retail), reception for visitors. 
</li> 
<li>Dairy and dairy processing centre. </li> 
<li>Domestic livestock ,housing, chickens, goats, pigs, </li> </ul> 
<p>PAGE 524 </p> 
<p>sheep, rabbits. </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Methane generator and ferment tanks, sewage, sullage, biomass conversion 
systems and water clean up. All sites for energy and water provision are public 
reserves.</li> 
<li>Glasshouses, commercial crop, and special crop. </li> 
<li>Camp area for casual visitors (toilets and showers); can be a youth or 
student hostel.</li> </ul> 
<p>Some community tools are needed for the site at large: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Tractor -slasher (fire control) </li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
-posthole borer (fencing)<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
-trailer<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
-chisel plough/soil conditioner<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
-chipper (biomass and mulch provider,fire control)</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Tow truck (mulch and goods} </li> 
<li>Van (goods} </li> 
<li>Back-pack slasher (blackberry and brush} </li> </ul> 
<p>In workshops, essential tools such as drill press, lathe, radial-arm saw, 
welder, planer or thicknesser, and router can be available on lease or time 
share. Trust B can undertake a charge on any tools, accounting for replacement 
cost, wear and tear, fuel or power, and a service charge.</p> 
<p>In planning, first designs should be for water and energy, then access, 
then dwellings and other<br>
 structures. Next, landuse can be indicated, and 
finally legal, social, and financial systems discussed for the place and time.
</p> 
<p>Dwellings need to be of varying types: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Family homes (individual or trust ownership; 2-5 bedrooms); </li> 
<li>Singles quarters (flats with strata title; some guest accommodation, 1-2 
bedrooms);</li> 
<li>Elderly and hospital quarters (strata and community trust title; single 
and double bedrooms);and</li> 
<li>Terrace housing where appropriate. </li> </ul> 
<p>A mix of such housing provides much more for needs and age differences than 
does the traditional family home. Every village could maintain one empty strata 
title for emergencies such as family break up, or to stage people in to 
permanent housing.</p> 
<p>Recently some American towns have enacted ordinances to force buildings to 
comply with a 60%<br>
 self sufficient space heating requirement. Every house 
built today can be close to 100% efficient by design alone, at no extra cost in 
construction. Solar hot water systems are now routine installations, and 
photo-voltaics almost so. That is, energy needs are solved mainly in the home 
by a combination of good design and hardware. However, energy can be generated 
in other ways, and site allowances should be made for this.</p> 
<p>The very modern &quot;urban' planning&quot; where city or town sectors are 
designated as industrial, commercial, residential, or recreational are in fact 
the very antithesis of good planning for transport energy conservation, and 
bear little or no relationship to the zonation of function and available time 
around a settlement or house, as outlined in Chapter Three.</p> 
<p>Wherever possible, life, work, and recreation should be integrated in a 
dwelling; not only are households better informed, children less alienated, and 
adults less isolated from social contact, but the need for complex transport 
systems is eliminated. We have a great deal to learn from older cities, which 
evolved in an energy conservative environment; cities such as Florence and 
Vienna, older parts of Berlin, and almost every village that functioned before 
1930. In all such settlements, the cultural, crafts, trades, commercial and 
domestic functions were integrated. Old city blocks in Berlin have housing over 
street level shops on the sunny side, trades and work in the easily accessible 
interiors of hofs that penetrated and opened up the ,centre of the block, and a 
market or supply depot close to this assembly.</p> 
<p>Such integrations are conducive to the development of complementary skills 
in the neighbourhood. In Istanbul and India trades may well be grouped in 
streets or market areas, so that both new materials, assembly, and sale are 
facilitated (and branches of each craft allotted, or adjusted to production by 
demand), but the total market or neighbourhood contains all trades except those 
based on rare resources or needed only on a regional basis.</p> 
<p>Young people growing up in such an environment have a capacity to use many 
materials, or to make whatever they require, as a result of the informal 
everyday association with the' open shops' that are the hallmark of small 
tradespeople, and where neighbours and family come and go the workplace itself. 
Davis (California) is one modern town where energy-conserving legislation is in 
place, and people are encouraged to conduct all non-polluting businesses from 
their homes; and where bikeways are available throughout the settled area. 
Elsewhere, &quot;zoned&quot; industries create vast traffic problems, and the 
separation of people from services.</p> 
<p>How is the land not attached to dwellings to be allotted? The following 
categories are of use in villages everywhere:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Land for recreation, trails, and walks. </li> 
<li>Water storages and reserves, energy sites. .Productive land for food: 
livestock, orchard, nursery, greenhouses.</li> 
<li>Forested areas (fuels and timbers). </li> 
<li>Reserves for wildlife and flora;conservation areas. </li> 
<li>Easements, wayleaves, roads, and public utility allotments. </li> 
<li>Commercial areas for retail, manufacturers, offices, professional 
services, common markets.</li> </ul> 
<p>Family dwellings and their 0.2-2 ha lots can accommodate some of these, but 
in miniature. Many homes are in fact commercial premises for home services and 
industries; many store their own roof water, provide much of their food from 
the garden, and may contain recreational assets. However, a larger site plan 
does allow more convivial access to land, some commercial crop potential, 
significant forests and ponds, and access and utility easements.<br>
 &nbsp; 
<br> &nbsp; <br>
 &nbsp; </p> 
<p>PAGE 525 <br>
 &nbsp; </p> 
<p>Public access and service centres&nbsp; owned by the village, such as food 
processing, freezer, and laundrette facilities not only provide a part-time 
income for a resident but sharply reduce the energy needs for each house to 
provide and maintain such facilities, and provide a wider district resource.</p>
<p>An even greater saving is realised by a modest tractor-tool-truck hire 
services, in which Trust B leases these infrequently used assets to residents 
as needed. Infact, a sensible village would closely investigate the advantages 
of a total vehicle leasing system, fleet purchase and insurance, local 
maintenance, and bulk fuel supply.</p> 
<p>Village Energy <br>
 Coupled with domestic energy conservation, modest 
power units can supply small villages or regions with their energy, an can 
certainly be started by the same protest groups, who rightly oppose giant coal, 
nuclear, oil-powered, centralised and polluting energy systems.</p> 
<p>Like any other enterprise, a diverse approach is recommended, with energy 
from wind, tide, river, solar and methane used where appropriate. Table 14.7 on 
energy conversion efficiency has been complied from several sources. It 
includes primary conversions (gas to several electricity) and secondary 
conversions (waste heat to high grade gas). However, mechanical efficiency is 
perhaps the least important concept for people, and is relevant only if:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The process is non-polluting, or relevant to the place. </li> 
<li>The technology is socially acceptable, and locally begin. </li> 
<li>The cost is affordable, and a mortises under 10 years. </li> 
<li>The technology can be locally produced and maintained. </li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp; Finally, no matter how efficient a technology may be, if it lays 
waste to or destroys the basic quality or quantity of soil, water, or clean 
air, then it must be rejected, as this is the &quot;economics of 
extinction&quot;. For this reason, I have not included fission processes with 
radioactive by-products, coal as now used, or mineral &quot; petroleum beyond 
initial or transition use.</p> 
<p>Financing Public Services <br>
 When all titles sell, the monies generated 
by the sale of &quot; the 30% of titles vested in the village trust would 
ensure a very large interest yield annually for village development. This 
would, in effect, build fences, terraces, and eventually schools, workshops, 
and alternative energy systems.</p> 
<p>At about year 5 of development, when residents have a clear idea of future 
needs, the capital itself can be<br>
 &nbsp; </p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>(PAGE 527) </p> 
<p>used to install wealth-producing assets for employment in the village 
(glasshouses, computers, machinery). By allotting 30% of sites to the body 
corporate (Trust A), the developers ensure that:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>All necessary public services are funded; </li> 
<li>Residents, over a period of 20 years, have effectively paid nothing for 
land; and</li> 
<li>As soon as sales exceed 60% of total titles, either capital or interest 
for public services is available.</li> </ul> 
<p>The trust can use this asset in many ways, but would be most effective in 
ensuring either conservation of energy or business development on site, and in 
using the common wealth for increasing local productive assets If a credit 
union has been established, much of the trust capital can be transferred to a 
loans account, so that residents can draw on it at low interest for local 
occupational development. Conscientious use of a credit union by village 
residents would greatly increase capital flow to village enterprises. There may 
be some capital available as housing loans, but a building cooperative would be 
much more effective in this instance.</p> 
<p>The result of having such capital and interest flowing in to the Trust is 
that village morale is greatly increased, with every resident seeing long-term 
plans fairly rapidly achieved. Well-managed, the capital should actually 
increase, giving a large annual capital for village use.</p> 
<p>The Trust will always need income for maintenance of roads, fences, water 
supply, fire control, and other site factors. This can be raised from small 
charges for leases and loans to residents, by charging an hourly rate a 10% 
levy on net profits of locally-funded cooperatives. This levy is the same as 
that paid by the Mondragaon cooperative system to fund their banks, schools, 
and research facilities in Spain, and applies only to net profits of 
trust-funded cooperatives.</p> 
<p>A Community Services Council at any new community or village with common 
lands may be elected to administer policy on publicly owned or common assets, 
to collect lease monies on utility plots, to administer funds for schools and 
medical services, and to see that rates are used in maintaining roads, water 
supplies, and other public services.</p> 
<p>&quot;Community Services&quot; in any community can encompass the following:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Fire control services </li> 
<li>Land leasing of common properties for business use. </li> 
<li>Public reserves and sports grounds </li> 
<li>Ambulance and health services; cemetery administration </li> 
<li>Education and educational facilities </li> 
<li>Community centre: use and hire </li> 
<li>Power and water supply </li> 
<li>Forest management </li> 
<li>Tourism/promotion (if desired) </li> </ul> 
<p>Some of these are income-producing, some subject to state aid or tax 
immunity, and some are income consuming. The Services Council needs. to attempt 
to balance these costs, allot land and assets for income to service groups, and 
ensure that common property and rights are fairly assigned and well managed.</p>
<p>Council should be comprised of a selection of those active in the above 
areas, not of an uninvolved group. Each area of action can have a basically 
independent management sub-group, reporting to Council regularly. These 
sub-groups can appoint one of their number to represent that group on Council.
</p> 
<p>Council needs to meet monthly, or even more infrequently, with the 
sub-groups normally handling everyday business within their budget and allotted 
areas of operation. A Council can call for and act on submissions or reports 
relating to specific policies and strategies. Sub-groups can raise their own 
funds (as well as have access to public funds) may have an active business 
management role in income-producing areas, and supply workers to carry out such 
businesses.</p> 
<p>Income is needed by a community for the continued upgrading of public 
services. There are several ways in which this may be done:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>LEVY: A yearly levy on each family or property can be collected by the 
Community Council. This would probably be in addition to the normal Shire 
Council rates, and may create a hardship on some households.</li> 
<li>TITHE: Individuals, groups, and businesses (including the cooperatives) 
can tithe 10% of net profit to the public services. All the Mondragon 
cooperatives do this, and so fund schools, libraries, churches, and 
recreational grounds. This means &quot;rates&quot; would be on a sliding scale, 
not a flat rate for everybody regardless of earning power.</li> 
<li>LOCAL CURRENCY: The Community Services Council print its own currency, 
backed up by a valuable community resource (firewood, clean bottled water) to 
fund projects, new buildings, etc. Local currency operations are detailed later 
in this chapter. A timber forest planted early on and harvested at various 
stages of maturity can produce most income needed for subsequent years, as it 
does in some modern towns which have developed social forestry.</li> 
<li>CHARGES: Charges by the school, community centre, and health services can 
be offset against costs on a &quot;user-pays&quot; basis for tuition, use of 
facilities, medical needs, etc. This is a method which should be used in 
conjunction with another model, as it covers only those public facilities which 
not everybody uses or wants; universally used services are usually pro-rated 
(&quot;rated&quot;).</li> </ul> 
<p>Potential Enterprises and Occupations <br>
 It is of great advantage to 
analyse just how village occupants can self-employ in service to the village 
itself and to nearby districts. Let us presume a 50-house(100 adults) village 
situation. Costs are high in three areas: food, energy, and transport.</p> 
<p>We can now speculate how residents can earn their living in the .village. 
Much depends on a village development credit union which is founded by the</p> 
<p>PAGE 528 </p> 
<p>village under Trust B to serve the village needs. <br>
 &nbsp; </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Food: About 20 adults can support 1 adult providing a food supply; thus, 5 
to 7 families can earn a living from food provision, e.g. open air market 
gardens, glasshouse crop, co-op store (with local trade), domestic livestock 
and fishery enterprise, and a part-time livelihood from cafe, food processing, 
and baked goods. All surplus can be sold off to visitors or locals from outside 
the village proper via a village market.</li> 
<li>Energy Energy needs include space heating, cooking, electric, hot water, 
gas, and appliances. To establish energy-efficient systems, plans need to 
include prior excellent house design, design for the retrofit of inefficient 
houses, insulation, and good appliances. Most need capital to start, but almost 
all amortise in 3-7 years. Two to five families can earn a living from house 
design and retrofit, with some contract and extension work outside the village, 
hardware and appliance sales to the village and to the district, and 
installing, repairing, and tending a village energy system. Over time, some 
manufacturers in the village would enable a balanced trade in appliances.</li> 
<li>Vehicles: These are perhaps the most costly item and need a careful and 
planned approach, better on a village network level than on a one-village 
system. Two to four livings are indicated in service, repairs, maintenance of 
village vehicles, bulk fuel and oil supply; in growing, distilling, or 
fermenting fuels for engines; and in fleet lease and insurance, special vehicle 
lease, tractor lease, etc. Village alliances can establish special engine or 
chassis manufacture.</li> 
<li>Financial: Handling the income, loans, accounting of enterprises, and 
running a credit union is an essential job for a village. A computer is 
certainly needed, as are accounting and managerial skills. Two people could 
perhaps handle the financing. A community credit union, holding insurance money 
as well as incomes, can fund enterprises such as energy systems, glasshouses, 
dairies, and food processing centres.</li> 
<li>Medical and pharmaceutical: One or two people can offer medical and 
pharmaceutical services to the village or area, including prescription, 
massage, counselling, and local treatment. Some medications can be made and 
sold more widely, and specific remedies grown or manufactured. Community health 
should always be based on prevention of most illnesses.</li> 
<li>Building: For some time, a plumber-builder- mechanic can serve village 
establishment and later maintenance needs locally, and can produce useful 
furnishings and sale items for extra income., if a woodworking area is made 
available.</li> </ul> 
<p>The above occupations cover the essentials of shelter,food, economy, 
energy, transport, and health. This I would initially fund about 20 of the 50 
households, and&nbsp; more as manufactures develop.</p> 
<p>Other than the essential occupations, there are a , range of potential 
village enterprises. Some can be&nbsp; based on land resources (glasshouse 
crop, special crop, cut flowers, herbs, pharmaceutical, processed dairy 
products, fish and aquaculture). Others can develop from local skills: teachers 
are needed for children, for adult education, and for applied workshops on 
site. Careful forward planning can yield one or two livings in workshops 
(craft, medical, or design). A small business service centre may be needed in 
the mid-term, employing 3-4 people.</p> 
<p>Consultancy for other sites in architecture, landscape, and design is 
possible, as is implementation and provision of plant materials from a nursery 
on site, which can further develop special crop for site, fire control, bees, 
orchards, or forages for animals (comfrey, tagasaste, etc.) Some people may 
like to cooperate in an animal-breeding programme for special poultry, &quot; 
pigeon, sheep, or goat breeds as a small stud.</p> 
<p>Computer services to a network, programming, and data bases on special 
subjects are now in demand, and can be placed in homes. Publishing is greatly 
assisted by computer word processing and allied computer typesetting services.
</p> 
<p>Trade, as distribution rights, wholesale potential, import-export trade and 
village trade networks are yet another probable enterprise, as art! craft 
products from metal or wood workshops, pottery, and art. There is a modest 
income from guests, visitors, and site tours if the village concurs on that 
aspect,. and from sales to visitors and travellers in the district; 
educational&nbsp; services and accommodation are much in demand.</p> 
<p>All of these, and many others, need little transport.Many can operate on 
site, and the cooperative store would serve as an outlet, or other leasehold 
retailers can offer goods and services for the village. Physical therapists and 
paramedics, especially in massage and stress-related problems, often find 
plenty of customers in a rural district.</p> 
<p>These enterprises depend on two basic factors: capital (enough money to 
start up and develop), and management (careful accounting, forward planning, 
market research and development, product development, sensible costing and 
staffing, correct lease and rental agreements, appropriate legal structures); 
thus a small business service centre is economical and necessary for 20 or more 
businesses.</p> 
<p>Many small enterprises yielding products or services can pre-sell their 
wares for initial capital, and many others need no capital to start up, but 
these may need time to develop. Some small businesses (massage, paramedical) 
need only skills to start, while others (market garden, orchard, furniture 
making) need skills, capital, and time.</p> 
<p>A careful assessment of skills and available capital will indicate 
priorities in any village. lncome-earning for local development is a priority, 
while other capital-intensive schemes (e.g. commercial pottery) need to wait. A 
very reliable early income can be made from information, by way of workshops 
and classes, although workshop income fades over time as students gain skills 
themselves. However, workshops yield capital for further developments locally, 
and a village</p> 
<p>PAGE 529 </p> 
<p>can, in fact, develop as a special education centre if enough skilled 
people are attracted to that idea.</p> 
<p>It should be the long-term aim of any village to own and operate its own 
employment enterprises. In past times, it was unusual for a villager to hold 
just one job; the banker was also a part-time barber and trader and perhaps 
gardener. Thus it is wise to share even simple occupations, so that individuals 
have occupational shares in 2-3 enterprises.</p> 
<p>In this way, total failure is unlikely, as is unemployment. Holidays can be 
taken, and wet days spent on indoor work. Thus, in every occupation, 
job-sharing should be the rule, not the exception. Although the total village 
structure is complex, the work of any individual is simple, as is the case with 
a plant in a polyculture.</p> <b></b> 
<p><b>RECYCLING IN THE COMMUNITY OR NEIGHBOURHOOD</b> <br>
 The borough of 
Devonport, in the city of Auckland, New Zealand, has a total solid 
waste-recycling system, and from this conservative endeavour manages to return 
a cash benefit to households (versus the cash payment or rates paid to Councils 
in non-recycling areas). Data is available from the borough, but there are two 
or three key features that make the system work:</p> <b></b> 
<p><b>1</b>. The borough issues an annual calendar, colour coded, and picks up 
only one or other category of waste on any one day, e.g.. clean glass, metal, 
tyres, paper, organic waste, oils, etc. No other, and no mixed loads are 
collected. Thus, recycling begins with separation of wastes by the consumer.</p>
<b></b> 
<p><b>2</b>. At the waste disposal site, loads must also be in one category. 
Here, wood is sorted into useful wood (a community woodwork centre is 
available), firewood (issued to elderly people), and chipping or mulch wood. 
All organics are composted by a small tractor windrow system, and all oils are 
collected for re-sale as lubrication oils after filtration. Compost is sold, as 
is mulch, and any surplus is used to carpet a &quot;ziggurat&quot; (ascending 
spiral ramp) made of broken pipe, brick, . clay, concrete, and clean fill; as 
the ziggurat ascends, community organic gardens follow the fill.</p> 
<p>The waste site is supervised, loads directed, and mixed waste sorted; 
saleable or recyclable items are grouped in clearly marked areas.</p> <b></b> 
<p><b>3</b>. People who will not sort their waste (about 4&quot;0) must buy a 
strong plastic bag from the borough (hire cost $7) which itself is recleaned 
for use. The charge on the bag pays for the bags, into which people separate 
the waste, and for the calendar; the borough also gets income from the sale of 
paper, glass, metals, wood, plastIcs, and compost.</p> 
<p>Obviously, the opportunity for local co-ops to enter into recycling 
industries is there; many small local<br>
 industries can buy wood, glass, 
paper, or oils from the borough. Such examples dictate that no Council has any 
excuse for not recycling; not only does waste cost the ratepayers money, but 
there is also a vast waste disposal problem. It is up to ratepayers to elect 
officials who will recycle sewage and solid wastes, and to vote out 
waste-promoting councils, who &quot;cost the earth&quot;!</p> 
<p>(FIGURE 14.8 RECYCLING: THE CHOICES- photo copy available on requeest) <br>

<br> PAGE 530 </p> <b></b> 
<p><b>EVOLUTION IN COMMUNITY</b> <br>
 No group can achieve financial 
self-reliance overnight, but within 5-7 years of a determined start, a 
cooperative group using their creative talents can succeed in making a living 
for themselves and building up a strong business sector in their community. Any 
person can feel a sense of social cohesion and group spirit in such a 
situation. The danger point of &quot;going under&quot; is past, and now it is 
time to think of diversifying and disinvestment before the group gets too 
affluent, or too big. At some point, therefore, a decision must be taken to 
take some positive action (and avoid the fate of affluence):</p> <b></b> 
<p><b>1</b>. To hand over to other some income-earning but superfluous (to the 
existing group) enterprise, and so reduce income.<br>
<b>2</b>. To extend aid 
and services to areas in desperate need, such as those experiencing real 
poverty, natural catastrophe, or medical insufficiency.</p> 
<p>Many groups put off such actions, but it is better to start them (at modest 
levels) very early in the whole process. There are many ethical groups and 
individuals who regularly tithe 10% of their gross income to such endeavours. 
Most of us do not have large appetites; we wish only to have a shelter, enough 
food, some small luxuries, money to travel, and friends. These are modest needs 
to achieve; beyond them lies adventure in helping others get on a firm footing. 
The only real security in life is a secure society of interdependent people, 
thus the only valid &quot;defence&quot; is aid to others.</p> 
<p>Any village group can help others become more self-reliant and give sound 
management advice to new groups. Fiscal management, like energy management, 
also needs social, environmental, and ethical accounting. Money is of no use if 
its ends are destructive to society, life forms, or values.</p> 
<p>Cooperative groups, communities, associations, and shared work groups fail 
in part to foresee and to plan for evolution. Also, more tragically, to educate 
their children in the basics of village systems. If any intelligent, 
hard-working, and ethical group pool some resources and take only a fair living 
wage, then they must amass spare capital in time.</p> 
<p>As and when independent villages do achieve an identity, an ethic, and 
unity, beneficial connections can be made ranging from radio and land links to 
bulk purchase, trade, and share facilities, so that coastal, urban, arid, 
tropical, and primarily rural villages can access and share the resources of 
others on an agreed-upon lease, hire, or exchange basis.</p> 
<p>Village coalitions can fund and operate larger , systems such as mutual 
investment funds for special purposes, engage in manufacturing on a reasonable 
scale, and exchange skills and strategies. At present, few villages have the 
initial sound legal, financial, and social structures to achieve this.</p> 
<p>There is no reason why a village could not own and operate a boat, trucks, 
or pack animals<br>
 trade, why a mountain or urban village could not purchase 
and manage a foothill farm for food production, and why an inland village could 
not finance part of a coast development, as many villages already do in India 
(along the Ganges) where towns and regions own pilgrim houses for voyagers. All 
these strategies enrich village or regional life, and give access to a wider 
world; this is particularly important for children and young people.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;<b>14.10</b> <br>
<b>EFFECTIVE WORKING GROUPS AND RIGHT LIVELIHOOD</b>
<br> In any human group endeavour, there are practical and effective, or 
impractical and ineffective, ways to manage a complex system. Impractical, 
frustrating, and time-consuming systems are those governed by large boards, 
assemblies, or groups (seven or more people). These &quot;meetings&quot;; have 
a chairperson, agendas, proposals, votes, or use concensus, and can go on for 
hours. Concensus, in particular, is an endless and pointless affair, with 
coercion of the often silent or incoherent abstainer by a vociferous minority. 
Thus, decisions reached by boards, parliaments, and concensus groups either 
oppress some individuals (votes) or are vetoed by dissenters. In either case, 
we have tyranny of a majority or tyranny of a minority, and a great deal of 
frustration and wasted time.</p> 
<p>The way to abolish such systems is to have one meeting where the sole 
agenda is to vote to abolish decision meetings-this is usually carried 
unanimously!-and another where a concensus is reached to abolish concensus-this 
too shouldn't take long. What do we put in place of such impediments to action?
</p> 
<p>In every group, there is work to do. This work needs to be set out clearly, 
as jobs or tasks. Tasks fall into two categories: those which are creative, 
productive, or constructive, hence pleasing, and those which are basically 
maintenance (domestic, office, and garden work). Of the first category, we seek 
volunteers to take up the tasks, and if they come forward, we ALLOT that task 
to them, agreeing on a timetable and stages of completion. Of the second 
category, we ROSTER people to do the work, laying out a worksheet and a 
(usually weekly or monthly) roster.</p> 
<p>Wherever no volunteers appear for any task, then the group as a whole 
contributes a tithe to pay for the task to be carried out by a contractor (as 
in many trade tasks); thus all work gets done one way or another.</p> 
<p>An essential strategy for rapid and flexible action is to limit the number 
of people responsible for anyone area of action or task. Some ideal number is 
between one and three individuals, who manage independently, but who may work 
to a general plan and schedule to fit in with others. Completion dates are set 
and notified to all people, and some form of report, diary, or plan is made 
public or minuted.</p> 
<p>PAGE 531 </p> 
<p>Thus, we can form small groups of one to three people who are responsible 
for management of a specific area of activity. It is a fail-safe strategy to 
attach occasional understudies to this small group, or to stand ready to 
duplicate the function if it is not being administered. (There is no more 
time-wasting process than that of believing people will act, and then finding 
that they will not.)</p> 
<p>This &quot;troika&quot; approach (1-3 people per function) ensures that 
meetings in anyone area are few; news can come out as reports, available to 
anybody. It also means that no one person or group has &quot;rights of 
decision&quot; over other functions or groups. Unfortunately, despite our most 
devout wishes, there are very few people who can start up and maintain a 
function; we are lucky if we can find 6 or 7 of these in any group of 30-40 
people. Thus, for all functions needing entrepreneurial skill, we need key 
people.</p> 
<p>However, there are many functions (from crafts and arts to gardening and 
building) that do not need entrepreneurial skills, but which follow if these 
resources are available. Thus, many people can be involved in primary 
production, processing, and building if only a few can manage the essential 
coordination and funding.</p> 
<p>In such a web of function, any one person can be in two or three teams, 
thus achieving a &quot;portfolio of occupations&quot;. Also, each group depends 
on each other being in function, and this is important for group unity; we 
presume a shared ethic and values, which are clearly spelt out, but do not 
assume love, trust, or any particular form of personal diet and behaviour 
except in line with ethics (we are never perfect, just moving towards 
improvement).</p> <b></b> 
<p><b>I.</b> Only in the initial planning do people need to assign or choose 
functions; once chosen, no group meetings for business are necessary.<br>
<b>2
</b>. Each group or sub-group is small enough to reach fast agreements and know 
of each others' movements and work.<br>
<b>3</b>. No consensus beyond that of 
an initial ethical and value consensus is necessary; everyday decisions are 
made by small groups.</p> 
<p>Certain behaviours occur at various group sizes; here are some approximate 
size and function groups:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>1-3 people: Executive decision, least meeting time, greater pressure to 
act, fast changes possible, fast replacement of key people.</li> 
<li>4-6 people: Good volunteer or cooperative group work, or work group for 
special single projects; good size for work exchange systems.</li> 
<li>7-20 people: Function well only in social condition; can be a recreational 
group or team,but at 7 or so, a chairperson is needed and decisions are slow 
and frustrating, often creating dissent.</li> 
<li>30-40 people: Acknowledged as the minimal group of people in which most 
human functions can be covered, and who (if well chosen) can cope with almost 
any type of pro</li> 
<li>40-200 people: Rarely found as a group or settlement, but a good size for 
a regional organisation.</li> 
<li>200-300 people: The basic number for genetic variability; such a group 
can, by careful breeding, maintain their numbers as a tribe and allow for some 
losses to disease. Probably the minimal human village size (called a hamlet).
</li> 
<li>300-600 people: About the limit at which people know every other person by 
name; thus, about the limit of &quot;identity&quot;. This is the largest 
satisfactory size for educational or learning systems if personal attention is 
valued. Acknowledged to be the upper limit for successful cooperatives for real 
participation.</li> 
<li>1,000-5,000 people: Usual upper limit of federations of tribes; a good 
size for a bioregional group or sub-region. Also, a village size limit. 
Cliques, theft and cheating common and possible; hierarchies are needed.</li> 
<li>7 ,000-40,000 people: Towns, large bioregions. Chinese communes start 
about here. This number is not satisfactory unless broken into small 
cooperatives and villages. Crowds and very large audiences can reach this size, 
and can be difficult to control if aroused. It is about the upper limit for any 
real control by strict hierarchical systems.</li> 
<li>15,000-10,000,000 people: Cities; mainly disorganised on every level. 
Effective anarchy and crime, and social isolation in many areas.</li> </ul> 
<p>As even very small numbers of people (4-6) can be very effective, it is 
better to set up independent but friendly alliances of small groups than to 
coalesce into groups of 600 or more. Any alliance of 4-10 villages 
(12,000-50,000 people) can, by agreement, run a sophisticated trade and travel 
organisation.</p> 
<p>Most groups start with 1-3 people, and recruit slowly. Slow or organic 
growth is easily coped with, while sudden influxes can be disruptive. As groups 
pass 30 or so in size, it may be possible to contemplate selective recruitment 
to make up deficiencies in skills, sex ratio, age differences, or specialties 
needed.</p> 
<p>Where a very large number of people is needed for a job, a calendar is set 
and conveners let everybody know when and where the person power is needed. 
Thus, every larger group needs to delegate responsibility for work to smaller 
autonomous groups, who are trusted to do the job, and only replaced if they 
persistently fail to do so. In this way, every person who wants to work 
controls their work, and non-involved people have no say. This eliminates 
control by inactive people in tasks they are not familiar with, and nullifies 
power seekers.</p> 
<p>As for dissenters, there never is any impediment to their setting up their 
own ideal system, and living in it; or setting up a parallel work group to show 
how it should be done. Above all, there is no one way to do anything. &quot;One 
solution&quot; systems evolve from the concentration of power in one or other 
form of dictatorship (business, government, or military).</p> 
<p>In this way, all group meetings can therefore be social and convivial, and 
for information exchange. As these<br>
 &nbsp; </p> 
<p>PAGE 532 </p> 
<p>meetings are pleasant, we can look forward to them, and so a pleasant and 
informative occasion replaces a frustrating and stressful &quot;group 
decision&quot; meeting.</p> 
<p>On a wider scale, cells of one to three people can a very large network; in 
this way, given occasional (every 2 years) meetings in affinities or work 
integration groups, attended by small autonomous groups, positive WORK-NETTING 
(not pointless networking) is possible. No person can force another group to 
cooperate, but must offer reasonable, rewarding, and fair cooperation.</p> 
<p>Above all, no group or community need last forever; group set up to achieve 
certain ends can disband with clear conscience if those ends are substantially 
achieved. Individuals can then take on new and more current tasks, or adopt a 
different level of effective :action based on past experience.</p> 
<p>No-one would deny that people are the most difficult factor in any design 
or assembly. It is not that people Iack the will to cooperate; it is more often 
that they have ot adapted those sensible legal and administrative, or social 
mechanisms which allow them to cooperate. At various periods of history, 
usually coincident with economic downturn, groups of people have left 
mainstream society to set up intentional communities. his phenomenom occurred 
in the 1890's, 1930's, and 960'5 and at various times between. The most recent 
1960-1990) is also the longest period of out-migration, nd is still continuing 
after 20 years; it is a migration of skilled family people towards a smaller 
society.</p> 
<p>Studies of such groups reveal that those who were effective adopted a set 
of values which ensured their continued internal and external interdependence; 
of those, perhaps the most important factor was that the group adopted 
&quot;voluntary simplicity&quot; as an ethic. It is no mere coincidence that 
there is both an historic and resent relationship between community (people 
assisting each other) and a poverty of power due to financial recession.</p> 
<p>Thus, the legal and ethical basis for successful community cooperation must 
stress sharing, trusteeship, and modest consumption; the latter is the ,ore 
important, as individual power over land, real assets, finance, or group 
membership leads inevitably power over others, and we are back where we 
started. The habit of frugality is perhaps the most important of those 
assisting other life forms.</p> 
<p>Like landscape planning, there are community systems which can cause more 
time spent in conflict than can be made up later; such errors we can still call 
primary errors as they will lead to constant problems and expense later. Some 
of them are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Group consensus on all decisions (tyranny of the dissenter). </li> 
<li>Group leadership by one or a few (tyranny of the elder) </li> 
<li>Rules about lifestyle (tyranny of proscription). </li> 
<li>Attempts to live in large group households (lack of ,privacy). </li> 
<li>Over scheduling of meetings. </li> 
<li>Neglect of income-producing activities. </li> 
<li>Poor financial accounting, hence poor maintenance of facilities and 
equipment.</li> </ul> 
<p>The individual in the community must recognise the need to subscribe to a 
group fund for maintaining roads, fences, and infrastructure, or to donate work 
in lieu of money on a regular basis. There are no &quot;free&quot; machines or 
free lunches. The essentials to concentrate on are sound land planning, 
shelter, a capital base, and the development of livelihoods.</p> 
<p>Many &quot;communal&quot; systems fail if very few people are legally 
liable for capital risk. Good ideas and equipment cost money to implement, thus 
all those who vote for equipment must be made equally liable to pay for it.. 
This always keeps the community healthy, as unused tools are expensive, but 
only for those who buy them! This is a lesson in modesty and responsibility. 
Moreover, tools on hire should completely repay their cost by charge on a 
piecework or hourly rate, over a period realistically estimated as half their 
working life (vehicles, tractors, office equipment and so on).<br>
 &quot;Every 
major tool needs to be costed for running costs, repairs, and replacement plus 
any interest on capital. The very powerful principle here is that 
&quot;everything must pay&quot;; more specifically, in community enterprises 
&quot;proposers pay capital&quot; and &quot;users pay costs&quot;. In natural 
systems this is the ;&quot;law of return&quot;. We cannot use soils, crops. or 
forests without costing total upkeep and replacement, or we impoverish the 
common wealth. Thus, &quot;users pay&quot; should apply at every level of 
community, except for hardship or welfare services.</p> 
<p>There are two unhappy states of human existence; the first and worst is to 
be defined by your community or nation as unemployed, that is to say, of no use 
to anyone. In a world where such a great deal of work has to be done just to 
repair past damage, replace forests, secure soils from loss, house people, or 
build local self-reliance, unemployment is an obscene concept. Where relief 
benefits are paid, the state rewards people to accept this role of &quot;no 
work&quot; , and in effect fines them if they work.</p> 
<p>Secondly, it is an unhappy state to be employed, but , not free to use 
initiative; any person can go daily to a job, no matter how useless or boring, 
no matter how destructive, and be paid to be defined in a single role, e.g. as 
a teacher, clerk, process worker, or labourer; the worker has no say in policy, 
social value, hours, product quality, or environmental worth.</p> 
<p>In most cases, other people define the lives of the recipients of relief or 
salaries; as all such money comes from the pool of public wealth, then all such 
people are, in effect, on &quot;relief payments&quot;, just as a company 
supported by public subsidy is on public relief (usually our primary production 
systems in the western world).</p> 
<p>The only people who are self-defined are those who are self-employed, or 
who work in community work cooperatives. The consumers pay for their products 
or services directly, and their houses, products, and choice of work is 
self-determined; they are only unhappy to the extent they oppress themselves! I 
could never</p> 
<p>page 533 </p> 
<p>understand&nbsp; why people struggle to maintain a job down a coalmine, 
especially when their pooled capital and labour could create a forest, with all 
the pleasure one gets from working in the open air, and the varied work a 
forest provides. We can all seek for right livelihood to do work that assists 
in caring for the earth or other people, work that is congruent with our 
beliefs.</p> 
<p>When we discuss the principle of &quot;commonwork&quot;, or study the 
varied 'roles of an individual in a village, we&nbsp; can see that no person is 
just a miner, or clerk, or banker, but that on different days one can be a 
banker, forester, bee-keeper, writer, printer, or carpenter. It is only the 
combined pressure of trade unions and monoculture industry that keeps people 
bound with the invisible shackles of custom to those unguarded slave camps 
termed industrial suburbs, with all their malnutrition, poor housing, and human 
suffering.</p> 
<p>In boring work, or where people are deprived of intellectual life, 
emotional life may dominate and so their lives become a drama or series of 
dramatic events. A balanced life has all three outlets, so that contented 
people may spend part of their time in: physical exertion (walking, gardening, 
sport); intellectual pursuits (design, research, education); and 
emotional-sensual areas (celebration, ontemplation, love).</p> 
<p>A healthy and balanced life consists of being able to access all such 
pursuits. In modern life, some time spent in primary production or in 
manufacture, some in service to a wider group, and some in relaxation 
celebration is an ideal; few achieve it. In Central Australian tribes, at every 
event there may be three &quot;function&quot; groups (independent of totems or 
&quot;skins&quot;): one group &quot;knows&quot; or records time-orchestrates 
(the intellectual); one carries out dances, increase ceremonies or activity 
(the physical); and one encourages, applauds, and appreciates (the emotional). 
Thus, every person fits a matrix of totem and function.<b>(Figure 14.2).</b>

<p><b>14.11</b> <br>
<b>MONEY AND FINANCE</b> </p> 
<p>In small and unified groups (tribes), what is achieved by financial systems 
elsewhere is achieved by a set of exchanges, gifts, obligations, and feasts; 
here social accounting replaces fiscal accounting and to a great extent, 
everybody &quot;owes&quot; the others. In many smaller villages, barter and 
exchange occurs as non-formal financial transactions, and a modest financial 
component is maintained only for travel and trade external to the region; 
symbolic wealth such as cowries are used in trade.</p> 
<p>Only in very mobile societies does money start to replace fair dealing, 
objective value, and hospitality shared, and the abstract and intrinsically 
valueless &quot;money&quot; (usually cheap strips of paper or lumps of metal) 
replaces real goods and services. Even in fiscal societies however, barter and 
exchange are<br>
 developed (even by multinational firms), and formal barter 
centres are now also evolving locally to distribute surplus goods for real or 
imagined needs. Faith in the fiscal system (an essential delusion if money is 
to maintain any barter value) is fading as nation states and giant corporations 
fail to meet their debts, and either repudiate debts or go into voluntary 
liquidation. In every case, the cost falls back on us. Large banks not only 
lose our money to start with, but make us pay for the loss. Large companies 
receive public subsidies (often direct cash subsidies, e.g. the sugar industry) 
that would make millionaires of paupers.</p> 
<p>Fiscal (moneybased) societies give a false impression of security, which 
quickly falls apart every 40 or so years when inflation-which is itself due to 
greed-makes currency valueless. The final &quot;inflation&quot; is caused by 
the misuse of money, and is now upon us. It is seen in the collapse of the 
environmental system. No amount of gold or diamonds can avert, reduce, or 
soften the blows that nature is raining upon us, and in the final accounting, a 
cabbage can be worth a king's castle (or more) if it saves your life. For the 
last 40 years or so, money has been made by destruction of real wealth (soils 
and forests) and the debts are now being called in by nature herself.</p> 
<p>Money is in itself not a resource, it represents (or should represent) a 
resource which lies &quot;somewhere else&quot;. Often, however, that resource 
is a useless object (a diamond) which people rarely find a need for in any 
lifethreatening crisis, and never in any global crisis such as now threatens 
us. Money, in a sane society, must therefore be tied or fixed in value relative 
to a useful real asset; this is the very basis of fair trade in large&nbsp; 
societies.</p> 
<p>All money arises from the wealth of the natural world (plants, clean water, 
clear air, stored energy). The accumulation of unused wealth, or wealth that 
does not lead to the proliferation of life, is a pollution of the same nature 
as any unused resource. Manure and money have much in common.<br>
 Insecure 
people can never have enough material resources, or the appearances of 
security. They tend to spend this money on monuments and protection rather than 
in assisting nature to produce wealth. Hence, we can find them associated with 
addictive, ostentatious, and exploitive occupations. Some tend to erect 
monuments to contain acquisitions (loot) in such places as museums, art 
galleries, stately homes, castles, libraries, and churches. Curiously, such 
monuments often display natural things portrayed in paintings and objects, but 
in so doing use up nature (the cedar table becoming more revered than the cedar 
tree, the leopard-skin coat more valued than the leopard).</p> 
<p>While natural resources fuel such &quot;wealth&quot;, artisans and 
architects develop the monuments, artists decorate them, and bankers, miners, 
and oil people fund or value them. The erection of monuments itself becomes a 
reason for existence. The rich are conspicuously represented in societies 
devoted to monument</p> 
<p>PAGE 534 </p> 
<p>but not in the area of landscape rehabilitation. </p> 
<p>It is but a short step from worshipping inside monuments to worshipping 
monuments themselves (people often being more proud of their church than they 
are of the trees and stones which were destroyed to build it). It is an even 
easier step to confuse oneself with the creator, and all the easier if one 
adopts a belief system in which god is portrayed as a man! (Some would say this 
is an insult to god)</p> 
<p>Money, however, is not intrinsically evil; it is the accumulation of money 
and its use to exploit others that is evil. The evil (privilege, power, 
stupidity, willfulness) lies within people, not within money itself. Nor is the 
making of money necessarily evil, providing the uses of money are creative and 
assist the natural world to proliferate. Thus, we can have a clear conscience 
on money put to earth rehabilitation.<br>
 We should develop or create wealth 
just as we develop landscapes, by concentrating on conservation of energy and 
natural resources (reducing the need to earn), by developing procreative assets 
(proliferating forests, prairies, and life systems), by reducing the creation 
of degenerative assets (roads, monuments, cities), and by constantly divesting 
ourselves of any surplus wealth to these ends.</p> 
<p>Money is to the social fabric as water is to land-scape. It is the agent of 
transport, the shaper and mover of trade. Like water, it is not the total 
amount of money entering a community which counts; it is the number of uses or 
duties to which we can divert money, and the number of cycles of use, that 
measures the availability of that money. Leakage from the community must 
therefore be prevented and recycling made the rule.</p> 
<p>Money itself is not a resource, and has no intrinsic value or use, but it 
can create categories of resources or assets, which we can identify as follows 
(after Turnbull, 1975):<br>
 *DEGENERATIVE: Those assets that decay, rust, or 
wear out: the buildings, roads, cars, furnishings, and appliances of society. 
Too many of these &quot;assets&quot; in any region will impoverish the region 
in the long term.</p> 
<p>*GENERATIVE: The tools of society; those things which manufacture or 
process raw materials into useful products (huskers, grinders, blenders, 
lathes, furnaces, and so on). These do wear out, but can be used to repair each 
other in workshops. All groups need some of the tools of processing and repair; 
a wise farmer hires out or shares such tools.</p> 
<p>*PROCREATIVE: The trees, wildlife, fish, invertebrates, mammals, and 
domestic livestock of a region. People who maximise a procreative asset base 
can support the use of some tools, and modest degenerative asSets. People who 
maximise the possession of degenerative assets eventually fail in their 
attempts to organise upkeep and repair-hence so many ruined castles and stately 
homes.</p> 
<p>I would also add to the above categories: <br>
 *INFORMATIONAL: Information 
(education and data), plus applied intelligence makes the best use of all 
assets, decides balances in the asset base, assesses future trends, and 
foresees needs and changes. Seeds have a high information content, as do books 
or data bases.</p> 
<p>*CONSERVATIVE: Insulation, dams, money re- cycling systems, good storage 
areas, and strategic forests to guard against erosion or desertification are 
all categories of conserver society assets. All these guard resources for 
future use, and are essential to a sustainable system.</p> 
<p>It follows that expenditure on categories 3 to 5 conserve and create wealth 
in any society. If a great many wealthproducing assets are available, then some 
degenerative assets can be supported, but any society which spends only on 
categories land 2 will first pollute, and then eventually extinguish, its 
resource base.<br>
 Apart from the asset categories given above, careful 
consideration must be given by any bioregion to what is locally conserved and 
used (the basis of regional wealth, such as soil) and what can be exported as a 
trade item (surplus water or surplus manufacture). It then follows that 
financial institutions should themselves pay close attention to their function 
in that region, preventing leakages of essential resources, and expediting the 
export of local surplus in order to bring scarce resources into the region. 
Such surplus should not, however, be based on the loss of any irreplaceable 
resource such as soil or humus.</p> 
<p>Above all, any financial institution should pay attention to two 
necessitous &quot;foundation stones&quot;:</p> 
<p>*AN ETHIC, expressed as a published, legally binding, and publicly known 
charter; and</p> 
<p>*RESTRICTION TO APPROPRIATE RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AND TRADE, in its 
operations (for not all financial institutions suit every objective of 
community).</p> 
<p>Without ethics or restrictions, any financial institution is a danger and a 
weakness in a community. With sound ethics and resource usage restrictions, any 
financial institution can prevent leakage of wealth and the erosion of basic 
resources, so that it is itself an asset to community, and builds wealth for 
re-investment.</p> 
<p>Financial institutions (those which deal in public funds) are of the 
following nature:<br>
 *Credit unions <br>
 *Credit cooperatives <br>
 *Tusts 
and foundations '<br>
 *Savings and loa~ banks, or associations i .Insurance 
agencies<br>
 *Finance companies and lending organisations .Commercial or 
merchant banks<br>
 *Investment brokers and stock exchanges <br>
 *Limited 
liability companies (risk capital)<br>
 *Trading or public companies <br>
 
*Cooperatives<br>
 There are other and minor systems in use, but each of the 
above are now worldwide, have specific appropriate uses, and can be fairly 
easily understood or created by any community. The essentials of an ethical 
banking system is not only that it has an ethical charter and is<br>
 &nbsp; 
</p> 
<p>pAGE 535 </p> 
<p>used for appropriate assets, but that it belongs to and is&nbsp; governed 
by the commnity it serves, and therefore is not open to distant or centralised 
control.</p> 
<p>One of the more extraordinary features of many of the strategies outlined 
in this chapter is that they have arisen in (and been developed and applied by) 
poor, depressed, minority, often unskilled, and frequently 
&quot;powerless&quot; groups. Good people everywhere can take financial and 
developmental control of their regions, give equal service to all people, and 
rise from an ethical but outcast sum of minorities to be a driving force in 
world stability. So go to it, as the sum of minorities is&nbsp; always the 
majority!.</p> 
<p>In this section, we are apparently talking about : money, but keep it clear 
in your mind that we are<br>
 actually talking about-a philosophy of true 
democracy, peace, and &quot;lifetime&quot;. Lifetime is that little space we 
are given to experience this world, which shapes up to, what we can imagine to 
be heaven, but where the&nbsp; achievement of paradise is constantly set back 
by the &quot;serpents&quot; of greed, power, stupid exploitation, and war.</p> 
<p>Time and money are often interchangeable. To control , the cash flow of our 
society is to control our lives. No price is too high to pay for the right to 
work at &quot;right livelihood&quot;, to consume what we can help produce, to 
feel secure, and not only to avoid harming, but to actively assist, other 
people and life forms. People who steal our independence steal our lifetimes; 
our personal independence relies on a cooperative human society.</p> 
<p>By changing ourselves, and living in closer harmony ! with life processes, 
we reduce the conflicts brought into our lives by the opposing demands of a 
truly sound economy and that of &quot;unlimited growth&quot; in the 
capitalistic sense; between a false assertion of human ,dominance over nature, 
and the certainty that we depend on all of nature; between the injunction to 
treat , all people as equal, and the status given to those who , consume and 
prosper at the expense of others; between &quot; the tyranny of need created by 
gadgets and luxury, and the satisfaction of working with others to achieve our 
basic needs; between our natural drive to accumulate possessions, and the 
realisation that it is only what we share that gives us access to all necessary 
possessions.</p> 
<p>THE INFORMAL ECONOMY <br>
 Barter is a common economy practiced 
particularly in&nbsp; rural or neighbourhood areas where people are more likely 
to know one another. At the household level, ! people exchange garden products 
and plants, share, labour, and exchange goods and services. Occasionally&nbsp; 
people may form 35 person work groups to build houses, create gardens, or clean 
up housework; these work&nbsp; groups may be episodic, forming the pattern of a 
roundrobin until all present needs are met.</p> 
<p>On a community level, or with more than 6-8 people involved, labour 
exchange may need to be coordinated or regulated. The Bendigo Home Builder's 
Club in Victoria, Australia is a group of 35 people building individual homes. 
They pay $') a year per family, mainly to cover the printing and distribution 
costs of the Club's newsletter. Each member can either be a recipient or donor 
of labour. The units of exchange are hours of labour, and all labour is 
considered equal. Using a standard labour exchange form (which is legally 
binding), the recipient is debited and the donor credited for every hour's work 
he or she performs. There is a Labour Organiser in the group to sort out the 
balance of payments, and to despatch labourers to a recipient (who must have at 
least 60 hours in credit).</p> 
<p>A Community Barter Club also works on a system of debfts and credits, where 
residents offer goods, services, and skills, from landscaping to massage, from 
mowing to printing. Even the Club secretary or organiser is paid in credits. A 
credit is calculated at one hour, and the donor and recipient agree among 
themselves what they consider the job is worth. People are not limited to a 
one-to-one exchange; as the Club organiser keeps records of the debits and 
credits of each individual, transactions occur as long as services are desired. 
The Community Barter Club can be an asset for people in the community who are 
unemployed or underemployed, and for those who need services but cannot afford 
to pay cash for them.</p> 
<p>Internal economics are greatly aided by exchange newsletters, computer 
services, and advertisement. These represent a good medium to swap goods in 
particular, with the Barter Centre charging only on a proportion of successful 
swaps. Several newsletters, like &quot;Exchange and Mart&quot; in the U.K. cope 
with this service. Brokerage houses now deal in large surplus barter systems 
for industry, using a Trade Unit (T.U.) valued at about $1, for pricing and 
exchange value. These can then be placed in smaller blocks for a variety of 
exchanges in goods and services, and are a good way to turn a large surplus of 
one commodity into a range of services and goods needed.</p> 
<p>L,E.T. System: <br>
 Conventional money derives from many agencies external 
to a community, and circulates throughout all communities, tending to be 
accumulated in cities, multinational coffers, and banks supporting large 
investors. Community money (or credit), however, is not usable or necessarily 
wanted outside that community, hence circulates indefinitely in the community, 
providing a constantly available resource.<br>
 The LET System (Local 
Employment Trading System) centres in a community: every joining member must be 
willing to consider trading in local &quot;green&quot; dollars. The LET dollars 
carry no interest, and administration costs are charged on a &quot;cost of 
service&quot; basis. Any taxes applicable are the responsibility of members, 
and any member can know the turnover or balance of any other member. Every 
member gets periodic statements of accounts. The currency, although equivalent 
to legal tender, is not issued and cannot be cashed in. Green dollars are 
&quot;earned&quot; by goods or services to others, and &quot;lost&quot; by 
using services or goods. All trade, or credit</p> 
<p>PAGE 536 <br>
 standing, is a public act, and refers to the community as a 
whole. However, unlike simple barter, a member in credit can spend over the 
whole range of services or goods offered.</p> 
<p>Production, as time spent by members in service to others, is thus never 
limited by the lack of money. Businesses can charge federal currency for spare 
parts, and green dollars for labour. Price is agreed upon by the individuals, 
and reported in to the LET centre by the consumer. .&quot;Foreign&quot; goods 
are thus more expensive, and local components increase; local businesses 
thrive. Charities and local farms benefit greatly, as charity donors can see 
their funds as likely to return to them. Anyone who wants work can offer 
services; they need not wait for &quot;jobs&quot; .As only members can trade 
with each other, the community account is at all times balanced. In effect, any 
member (by working or selling) issues their own currency, and could return any 
community to full employment. An ideal member has many transactions, but 
accumulates modest debits and credits. See under Resources at the end of this 
chapter for addresses.</p> 
<p>Finally, the informal economy includes purely volunteer labour, exchanges 
of gifts, and taking responsibility for a certain community project or area. 
For example, convivial treeplanting on community common areas should be a part 
of every household's responsibilities. This may well be achieved by the 
&quot;adoption&quot; of a few acres of community forest by a household. Other 
community projects can be helped along by volunteer efforts, gifts of 
materials, and gifts of time as advisors or entertainers.</p> 
<p>THE FORMAL ECONOMY <br>
 &quot;Formal&quot; means that goods or services 
are conducted under a legal umbrella, and are regulated by accounting 
procedures. Exchange can still take place, but it is accounted for in terms of 
stocks or services. Such formal economics are necessary where people (managers) 
act hJr a group of members or mvestors, and not just for themselves or their 
households. Legal procedures must also be followed by selfemployed people or 
family businesses, where cash is received for goods or services rendered or 
offered publicly.<br>
 A community may have at least these formal structures 
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Cooperatives </li> 
<li>Community savings and loans </li> 
<li>Small businesses service office </li> 
<li>Investment funds for special projects </li> 
<li>Leasing company or system </li> </ul> 
<p><br>
Coopratives <br>
 A cooperative is a group of people acting together 
for the benefit of members. It is a legal entity with limited liability, and 
perpetual succession (no dissolution for individual gain). It has several 
principles:<br>
 &nbsp; </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Open membership (open to all who can make use of the services and will 
accept the responsibilities of membership).</li> 
<li>Democratic organisation (members participate in decisions affecting the 
cooperative, with affairs to be administered by people elected by the members}.
</li> 
<li>Strictly limited interest on share capital (fair but limited award for 
capital and restricted influence of people holding share capital).</li> 
<li>Surplus or savings out of the operation of the cooperative belong to 
members (with members to decide on the use of the surplus, whether to develop 
the business, to provide common services for members, and/or to distribute 
among members according to the degree of involvement in the cooperative).</li> 
<li>Education (cooperatives should provide education for members, officers, 
employees, and the public on principles and techniques of cooperation).</li> 
<li>Cooperation between cooperatives (encourages the development of more 
cooperatives)</li> </ul> 
<p>The worker--cooperative centred around Mondragon, in the Basque region of 
Spain, are worthy of note. In less than 30 years, 96 workercooperatives, 
employing 17,000 worker-members, have emerged. Each person is required to 
invest about $5,000 when joining. This can be borrowed from the bank or 
obtained by installments deducted from wages over a two-year period. Of this 
investment, 20% is a contribution to collectively owned funds, and 80% is for 
the purchase of an individual shareholding or capital account (which is 
normally not drawn upon by the worker except bn retirement, death, or in cases 
of extreme hardship). In this way, a co-op can partially fund itself, with 
generous help from the cooperative bank.</p> 
<p>The Mondragon cooperatives have several features: </p> 
<p>1. 10% of the profits must be returned to the community for public 
services. 20% of the profits are held as capital reserves, and 70% are 
distributed to workers, although not all of this is available for withdrawal 
until a worker leaves the cooperative, at which point all of their financial 
interest in the business must be withdrawn. The worker is, in effect, 
&quot;loaning&quot; the cooperative the money, and so receives interest.<br>
 
2. A cooperatively run bank oversees the functioning of all new cooperatives in 
the group, finances new cooperatives (up to 90%}, and offers expert managment 
skills.<br>
 3. No redundancies in the cooperatives-workers are retrained and 
new jobs found in other expanding co-operative groups.<br>
 4. The ratio of the 
lowest to the highest paid person is never greater than 1 :5.<br>
 5. An annual 
meeting of all workers in a particular enterprise elects both directors 
(managers) to run the business and a social council (union) to negotiate with 
directors on work conditions, pay, education, etc. The meeting observes the 
principle of one worker, one vote.<br>
 6. Each cooperative averages about 
200-300 worker-owners; large numbers become too impersonal, and large 
cooperatives are divided into smaller independent units.<br>
 7. The community 
has cooperative schools, hospitals,</p> 
<p>PAGE 537 </p> 
<p>a university, housing, health and welfare services, a technical research 
laboratory, super-markets, banks, and computer centres; all of these are 
cooperatives, and schools earn part of their costs by contract to manufacturing 
cooperatives.</p> 
<p>Unlike the Mondragon cooperatives, which are usually appliance 
manufacturing factories, a small community cooperative might have three 
categories of membership, as below:</p> 
<p>1. Worker-owners: These manage the cooperative, and are split into 
&quot;management&quot; and &quot;union&quot; groups. They contribute a set 
amount of capital into the capital fund, of which a percentage can be withdrawn 
should the worker depart. Only the worker-owners have a vote. Managers are 
elected, and are responsible to the rest of the group; they can also be sacked!
<br> 2. Corporate members: These are the primary producer, manufacturing, or 
public service associations. They are the users of the store cooperative in 
that their products are sold there, and/ or they receive bulk supplies through 
the store for their business. They also pay a joining fee to capital funds. 
They may cooperate together for group insurance purposes. Voting powers can be 
allotted on the basis of involvement.<br>
 3. Households: Basically consumers, 
each household pays a nominal joining fee, goods are bought at a discount, and 
an annual dividend is received for the bulk purchases over the year. There is 
no vote.<br>
 Cooperatives also involve sharing, achieved by spreading the 
skills needed for anyone job over more than one person (rotating jobs); by 
having near equality in shareholding; and by being able therefore to assess how 
others are coping with a job. Cooperatives have a greater demand on the energy 
and time of their workers-there are often planning or assessment sessions after 
working hours. However, productivity in such cooperatives is very high, and 
incomes or profits correspondingly high.</p> 
<p>Even in cooperatives, the functions of management (supervision, 
administration, accounting, and assessing) and worker representation (unions) 
are necessary, but unlike privately owned businesses, the whole workforce are 
shareholders, and all vote for people to fill these positions. Thus, the work 
force has total control over the composition of representatives, rather like a 
bioregion.</p> 
<p>In fact, a bioregion is a sort of multi-cooperative, where smaller groups 
take on specific services, thus specific responsibilities. Nobody 
&quot;represents&quot; a bioregion or cooperative in the ungovernable sense 
that elected politicians &quot;represent&quot; their electorate (i.e. every 
&quot;representation&quot; or policy decision of a coopera-tive comes from the 
ground up; whereas almost every politician makes purely personal decisions over 
avast range of policy and expenditure-and that is &quot;manage. ment out of 
control&quot;). In fact, today's governments are not only in themselves 
irresponsible, but they often fund secret and far more irresponsible agencies,
<br> responsible to nobody! </p> 
<p>Community Savings and Loans <br>
 A worthwhile goal of any community would 
be to keep the money saved and earned in the community cycling within itself. 
The only way to do this is to establish fin~ncial and economic systems onsite, 
such as a credit union, revolving loan fund, or local currency.</p> 
<p>Credit Union </p> 
<p>Anyone who belongs to an identifiable group of 30 or more people can start 
a credit union. The purpose or charter of this credit union can be to fund 
local or neighbourhood self-reliance. A community credit union can pay all 
routine accounts of a household; some credit unions even have a cheque account 
service. Credit unions or friendly societies can set aside 10% of income to 
satisfy instant requests for money from depositors; larger sums can be 
withdrawn at short notice-often within a week. Friendly societies handle health 
and insurance.</p> 
<p>The credit union can carefully assess loan applications. Money borrowed in 
order to save money is soon repaid, and so is safe to lend. Thus, money 
advanced for gardens, fuel conservation, energy generation, or for appropriate 
vehicles and appliances is soon returned. The savings (in time) exceeds the 
cash borrowed; from then on, the borrower has some spare capital. Usually, 
money borrowed to save energy is amortised over periods of from 2-7 years.</p> 
<p>The Revolving Loan Fund </p> 
<p>The basic principle of a revolving loans fund is that people put in 
$500-5,000 capital at a nominated interest (from 010%) into an established 
financial institution, and this is then loaned out to new businesses within the 
community. The group in charge of administering the loan checks references, 
offers advice, and .acts on the recommendation of people who will service the 
loan (usually a skills or research group of volunteers, some of whom may take 
part in, or service, the business).</p> 
<p>This can be called a loans trust, credit union, finance cooperative or 
enterprise fund pool; it can include barter, a labour exchange, a regular fair 
or market, and it needs an open register of local skills and resources, well 
displayed. Such a modest fund can operate out of a house or old shop front, or 
from a counter in an established food co-op or cooperative business.</p> 
<p>On average, informed and concerned people will initially contribute a few 
hundred dollars, just &quot;to see a good thing go&quot;. This is enough; 
others will have good ideas about small essential services and businesses, and 
the research group can be very busy researching and publicising 
&quot;leaks&quot; of money from the area, so that under or unemployed people 
can start up services and supplies to stop these leaks, e.g. Does the area make 
its own bread, yoghurt, sausages, shoes, clothes, pots and paper? Does it reuse 
its waste wood, glass, metal, paper, or organic wastes? Does it provide a wide 
range of services from haircutting to legal advice? If not, jobs are open and 
funds to start them are available! Loans, at low local interest (6-11% is fair) 
are made, and every.</p> 
<p>page 538 </p> 
<p>borrower must be a contributor (active investment). The skills group help 
to sclect equipment, test markets (presale of products is ideal), train young 
entrepreneurs in bookkeeping, and find resources and materials. Very few of 
such publicly needed, publicly funded and publicly open businesses fail. 
Everybody is self interested in their success!</p> 
<p>As confidence in the local f.und grows, loans can start to cover 
energy-saving house additions, insulation, or new well-designed housing, small 
vehicles, small fuel supply technology, and land purchase for approved 
projects. Even so, funds subscribed may always exceed demand (businesses are 
slow to develop), so the fund managers should always be ready to fund the 
start-up of mort advanced money systems such as investment advisors in ethical 
trusts, local insurance and banking, and a local &quot;mint&quot; to print a 
district currency of non-inflatable money, which in the end is also 
non-interest bearing.</p> 
<p>Every place where this has started (and since 1980,. there are dozens or 
hundreds of funds, currencies, barter fairs, and investment trusts established 
to build a sustainable future) has benefited. Imports are greatly decreased, 
local employment rises rapidly, good products {and security) are available, and 
community morale is enhanced.</p> 
<p>Thus, community savings and loans associations are appropriate for reducing 
community and household costs, and freeing more capital into the'community, 
which leads us to the S.H.A.R.E. and C.E.L.T. systems of 
&quot;wealth-producing&quot; loans. These are revolving loan funds that provide 
capital to community-based groups, enriching the community and forming a strong 
support base for the businesses established.</p> 
<p>S.H.A.R.E. stands for Self Help Association for a Regional Economy. It is a 
local nonprofit corporation formed to help encourage small businesses that are 
producing necessary goods and services for the community (in this case, the 
Berkshire area in Massachusetts, U.S.A.). It works in conjunction with a local 
bank in the area. Members of the community can become S.H.A.R.E. members, which 
means they open a S.H.A.R.E. joint account with the bank. They receive only 6% 
interest (but this means small loans can be given out at 10%, interest). The 
person receiving the loan must first collect references from people who know 
them as responsible and conscientious. They must show that the proposed 
business will attract customers from the community or even from outside the 
community. By doing this preliminary work, the borrower gets to know many 
people, and the community has a keen interest in seeing that the business 
succeeds.</p> 
<p>C.E.LT. .stands for Community Enterprise Loans Trust, a New Zealandwide 
charitable trust to promote and support small businesses and cooperatives. 
C.E.L.T. helps people form and run cooperatives and other enterprises by 
providing advice, running training sessions so that people can learn 
cooperative business skills, and by providing loans.</p> 
<p>C.E.L.T. services are funded by subscriptions from the 'public ($5), by 
donations, and by government special schemes. Education and other work is 
funded by the interest from deposits and loans. C.E.L.T. accepts cash deposits, 
and lends out to enterprises working closely with them until they are on their 
feet.</p> 
<p>Depositors receive from 0-12% interest per year depending on the amount of 
time the money is in the account, and whether the depositor wants interest 
paid. The borrowing criteria is that the entrepreneur must be willing to work 
closely and regularly with CELT during the loan so that a business has the 
greatest chance to succeed. CELT has now achieved the status of a bank, and can 
offer services such as a bank offers.</p> 
<p>Southern Cross Capital Exchange Ltd, operating out of Wentworth Falls, NSW, 
Australia, is a nonprofit organisation that brings together those who want to 
borrow from specific (socially conscious) projects, and those who have money to 
loan to such projects. The role of the S.C.C.E .is to review applications for 
loans and to recommend individuals and businesses to receive these loans. It is 
not a bank or finance company, and so loans through the S.C.C.E. are not 
secured. However, they are guaranteed by the Exchange (though only if loans are 
made through S.C.C.E., not directly to the project). The borrowers make 
personal guarantees, and &quot;guarantee circles&quot; are set up to spread the 
risk (e.g. parents who want to build a school will all guarantee to pay back 
the loan). This sort of capital exchange format may be one way in which 
community schools and other socially conscious projects can become financially 
viable.</p> 
<p>Local Currency </p> 
<p>As the community gains skills in financial management, there is no reason 
why an internal and district economy should not be bolstered by a noninflating 
currency printed by the community. Already this is done by individuals and 
businesses who have a product or skill to sell (real value), and who print up 
vouchers or coupons to pay for setting up their business. For example, a 
publishing company sends out pre-publication order slips to people before a 
particular book is published. People buy or preprchase the book at a slightly 
reduced price, which enables the publisher to print the book (this is how the 
book you are reading was printed)</p> 
<p>In another example, a restaurant (Zoo Zoos) in Washington State, USA, in 
transferring from single ownership to a work cooperative, needed to raise funds 
to buyout the owner. They printed meal vouchers, redeemable up to one year, and 
sold them to future customers and friends. Most people came in to eat their 
promised meal, but some vouchers were traded to other people for some other 
service in the community, and thus the &quot;currency&quot; starts circulatin~ 
as vouchers relating to a real commodity.</p> 
<p>There are many currencies in every society, such as <br>
 &nbsp; </p> 
<p>PAGE 539 (FIGURE&nbsp; 14.9&nbsp; EVOLUTION OF A LOCALLY-APPROPRIATE MONEY 
SYSTEM<br>
<br>
 PAGE 540 (FIGURE 14.10&nbsp;&nbsp; CURRENCY <br>
<br>
 PAGE 541
</p> 
<p>promises, exchanges, stamps, coupons, vouchers, cigarettes, hugs and 
kisses. All are freely and legally exchanged for goods or services, which are 
themselves interchangeable (a song for a lettuce is a good bargain).</p> 
<p>However, we need a redeemable, solid, real and objective currency for trade 
and exchange. For currency to be valid and usable, some preconditions are 
necessary. First, it must be backed up by areal, objective resource. Secondly, 
other people must have confidence in it, which is why it is backed up by a 
local resource and can therefore be traded. Lastly, there must be a demand for 
its use, and a place to exchange it for other currency so that it works as well 
for other people as it does locally.</p> 
<p>Demand means that there must be a real need for some item or service 
lacking in the local society. Now, any community printing its own currency has 
these things to do:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Find and lease a resource that can be pledged to the exchange institution 
as a redeemable asset. If this is timber, the currency is based on &quot;a cord 
of timber, cut and stacked in the woodyard at such-and-such a place&quot;, or 
if clean water &quot;a gallon of water bottled and redeemable at a certain 
place.&quot; This is the resenJe and gives confidence in the currency.</li> 
<li>Print the currency itself, preferably in a solid local material difficult 
to duplicate or forge elsewhere, and numbered, dated and counted. The value so 
printed should not exceed the value of the reserve by a factor of more than 3 
times. Reserve pledges need to be publicly available and assessed. Notes can 
exceed reserves if used for procreative assets only (e.g. forests). Forests 
represent firewood, but reserves are never cut except in dire emergencies.</li> 
<li>Educate local businesses and banks (exchanges) in the use of the currency, 
which can be changed for the national currency (while this lasts) at the bank, 
or for other regional currencies. Post exchange rates publicly at the money 
exchange or bank and issue the currency to banks-</li> 
<li>.Start satisfying the demand (e.g. for homes) by lending the currency to 
builders, who can exchange it at the bank for other currency needed in trade, 
or locally for products and services</li> </ul> 
<p>The bank should not itself decide uses; the commun- ity (via a set of 
financial, advisory or monitoring institutions owned by them) should do that. 
Currency should be used to satisfy real needs of the community for food, 
shelter, trade. As we are talking about community money, its uses need to be 
decided by that community.</p> 
<p>Producers of local goods, accept local currency only; this creates a 
demand, and other regions must &quot;buy&quot; such currency to obtain local 
goods. Most local businesses will accept a regional currency.</p> 
<p>Note: That if reserves are living things such as trees, wealth increases 
and can be created. Even if a currency was originally based on bricks, it can 
be used to create such biological reserves as forests over time.</p> 
<p>To prevent hoarding, notes can be dated and anew issue us made every 4-5 
years; this is also a check on unwarranted accumulation, and possible forgeries.
</p> 
<p>Wherever there is a need (for housing, roads, small businesses, farms), the 
dollars needed are supplied by the exchange, but the borrower or user must 
repay in local currency, thus creating a demand for it. Most small businesses 
accept the currency, and much of the local trade can be carried on in this 
currency. When most needs of the region are met, the currency can be collapsed. 
Many small towns funded their public works this way in the 1930's. The E. F. 
Schumacher Society, Great Barrington, Mass. U.S.A. has data on these systems, 
and runs one such currency (see Resource listing at the end of this chapter).
</p> 
<p>Critical personnel to attach to a revolving loans office are in the 
following categories:<br>
 1. Asssessor-designers: People skilled in good 
house, factory, and farm design, energy budgeting, and appropriate 
technology-the &quot;permaculture&quot; team, used to help assess proposals to 
be funded.<br>
 2. Accountants: People skilled in setting up appropriate 
accounting systems to monitor progress and profit in ventures, working closely 
with team (a).<br>
 3, Broker-bankers: People actually handling cash flow, 
assessing reserves, and operating the banking and insurance functions of the 
office.<br>
 4. Lawyer-trustees: People able to package a set of legal 
strategies for community or family groups, and to advise (with 2) on taxation, 
export-import, trust and leasing documents, labour exchange agreements, and 
company, commonwork, or cooperative law.<br>
 5. Real estate or realty: The 
office can handle the bookkeeping and serving of local industry and services, 
supply goods, advise, provide labour and goods exchange, and arrange legal 
forms. Through the designers, users can obtain help in buil9ing and land 
design, nursery and livestock services, and appropriate tools.</p> 
<p>For a developed region, services such as a travel club, credit union, food 
cooperative (or rather, group purchase cooperative), farm club, and educational 
and medical services can also be provided. It must be stressed that the 
&quot;revolving loans office&quot; is not a place but a group in cooperative 
function. Each may operate in their own home, but all services are listed in an 
educational or informational newsletter and can combine where needed.</p> 
<p>Small Bus.iness Services Centre <br>
 There will no doubt be many 
businesses run in any community which are not run as cooperatives. However, 
that should not preclude their sharing in certain commonlyused services, such 
as accounting, telephone services, secretaries, telex, insurance, distribution, 
cocataloguing of goods, group advertising, and export assistance. A small 
business services centre is itself a small business, now very popular and 
effective in India. It may be a key organisation in a bioregion.</p> 
<p>PAGE 542 </p> 
<p>A great benefit to having many business offices located in one place is the 
increased number of consumers and the ability to concentrate many products in a 
single product catalogue. Direct marketing is a fastgrowing selling technique; 
it cuts out the retailer and so enables a product to be sold at a lower price 
than can be offered by a conventional retailer. A product catalogue is often a 
valuable product in itself, offering product information and advice. Many 
people want to support small businesses and cooperatives, and often get into 
the spirit of the venture when they read about individuals and businesses in 
the catalogue. The real saving to small businesses is shared facilities such as 
premises, accounting, and office services.</p> 
<p>In addition, the possibility of a group label for products exists in a 
community. Although each business may be a separate entity, the label can be of 
a similar design, with the words &quot; Another Product from Boon Dock&quot; 
(or some such) printed at the bottom. Otherwise, each label has its own 
business name and information. This generates interest in the community 
products, which. should gain a valuable reputation for quality, durability, or 
taste as standards for the group label are established.</p> 
<p>Small business service centres can offer the following facilities to 
businesses:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Secretarial: Letters, prospectus, submissions, writing and presentation, 
filing, mail order.</li> 
<li>Bookkeeping. Banking, cost accounting, summary and position analyses, 
presentation to accountants at years' end. Billing and collecting accounts, 
paying bills.</li> 
<li>Accounting: Tax assessment, broad strategies, trust advice, plan of 
networking monies, common funds, trust administration.</li> 
<li>Legal. Legal forms, leases, representation in litigation, land and 
propertyconveyancy, new legal structure design, seminar services, trust 
structure-</li> 
<li>Communication: Phone, telex, fax services, photocopy, answering services, 
travel arrangements and despatch-</li> 
<li>Gift, tithe, and public service deductions. Setting up funds for aid, tree 
planting, and accepting gifts to aid trusts; servicing land access and 
investment systems.</li> 
<li>Education. Holding seminars, inviting speakers, and instructing new 
members in services and procedures; assisting neighbouring regions to set up 
parallel and allied services-</li> 
<li>Skills register. Keeping a file on key people available for special advice 
and assessment.</li> 
<li>Research services. Retrieval and basic research for region and projects. 
</li> 
<li>Lease of seminar rooms, small warehousing, equipment, office space. </li> 
</ul> 
<p>In business, there is no substitute for good management, budgeting, 
accounting, and marketing skills. Most of what makes a successful business is 
the combination of human-centred values with good management, which we have 
listed below (paraphrasing from the findings of the book In Search<br>
 of 
Excellence by T. Peters and R. Waterman, 1984, Harper &amp; Row).</p> 
<p>1. Shared and stated values: All concerned with the company believe 
strongly in a set of values, often restated. Such values need to be carefully 
framed, realistic, and simple to remember. They are also inherent in the 
following:<br>
 2. Respect and encouragement: Management should give staff 
control of their own areas, encourage them to develop new ideas, and to follow 
guidelines and values rather than a rigid set of rules.<br>
 3. Reputation: The 
company maintains a reputation for high-quality products, service, and 
reliability. This cannot be stressed often enough. Most customers will deal 
with a firm over and over again if it proves to be reliable, rather than take a 
chance with a company which may be cheap, but which maintains such sloppy 
standards as slow service and shoddy products.<br>
 4. Lean management: 
Successful businesses use a simple organisational structure, a minimum of staff 
directing operations, and no &quot;corporate planners&quot; or analysts. 
Management is often in close contact with both producers (staff) and customers, 
and involved in production.<br>
 5. Action: Once a decision is made, effort is 
made to get it done with all possible speed. Customer reaction is then gauged 
in a matter of weeks or months, not years.<br>
 6. Familiarity: In expansion, 
or in new products, good businesses stick to what they know best (and don't 
expand into or acquire a business in an unfamiliar field).<br>
 In summary 
then, the successful business:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>states group values and maintains a sense of loyalty to those values, </li>
<li>personalises services, good quality, prompt service, and reliability, </li>
<li>innovates in its area of expertise and looks ahead, and </li> 
<li>has a lean structure, and no uninvolved staff. </li> </ul> 
<p>Attention to current and future trends (social, climatic, economic, 
political) is essential for any business group, and small business centres can 
research on such trends; societies change according to new information, 
products, and materials, and businesses must change or expand with these trends.
</p> 
<p>In addition to normal business principles, the more intense and more 
democratic operation of cooperatives demands that co-op staff must participate 
in planning, seriously contributing to policy, procedures, and inno- vations. 
The sharing of &quot;power&quot; is really a sharing of responsibility; part of 
that responsibility is the capital risk of any enterprise.</p> 
<p>Leasing Systems <br>
 Any cooperative or village could run a leasing 
service for seldom-used items of capital equipment (photo- copiers to trucks) 
which individuals or businesses do need on occasion.<br>
 User Pays Principle: 
From privately to publicly owned</p> 
<p>PAGE 543 FIGURE 14.11&nbsp; (SCEMATIC OF CAPITAL FLOW WITHIN AND WITHOUT A 
VILLAGE)<br>
<br>

<p>assets (sewing machines to reference libraries), a charge sufficient to 
cover running costs, repairs, and replacements must be placed on that item. 
This may be subscription (library) or piece work (photocopier), hourly rate 
(computer) or miles travelled (vehicle). These charges apply equally to 
businesses, administration, trusts, and private groups or individuals. 
Persistent misuse (e.g. of a vehicle) results in a withholding period or 
permanent withdrawal of permission to use.</p> 
<p>Personal Accountability Principle: This applies to any group purchases, 
whether public or private. The group purchasing is held totally and 
individually responsible for payment for any item. This is rigorously applied 
and holds even if I! member leaves a 8roup or the community. This principle 
stops &quot;l'vegotabright idea&quot; and a &quot;Iet'sgetit&quot; 
approach-ideas must be paid for. If the idea is a good one, it will pay itself 
off in time through lease. An example of this sort is if a group of five wanted 
to purchase a large brush chipper to create compost for themselves and to hire 
out to others in the community. A chipper would be purchased, and an hourly 
charge put on it to cover purchase, maintenance, and replacement. Eventually, 
if the chipper is used by enough people, it may even be possible for the 
original five to get a return on their money, although this was not necessarily 
an aim.</p> 
<p>Special coinvestment on projects can be initiated by advertisement in the 
community. Examples are: group water storages or energy systems, group 
refrigeration facilities, coownership of a fishing vessel or coastal holiday 
home, etc. These are not working cooperatives or businesses, but rather 
projects that save money or give the opportunity for a wider range of resources 
than if each person had to fund them individually. The investing group decides 
expense, location, and use<br>
 payments. </p> 
<p>14.12 <br>
<b>LAND ACCESS</b> </p> 
<p>TRUSTEESHIP OF LAND <br>
 Our own lifetimes are, in terms of soils, trees, 
or climate, as ephemeral as snowflakes. For a little while, we have the use of 
the earth, and Our time here is bounded by birth and death. Thus the very 
concept of land ownership is ludicrous, and we need only to use what is needed 
for the brief time that we are here; even I birth and death are small events in 
a total life pool. continuum. I</p> 
<p>The law clearly distinguishes between ownership or ( entitlement to a 
resource, and the rights of the use of it.&nbsp; Laws of ownership are 
relatively modern, and are foreign to tribal or clan law. Laws of trusteeship 
are ( ancient, philosophical and realistic. Ownership, in&nbsp; effect, gives 
the titleholder (person or state) a &quot;right to&nbsp; exploit in the short 
term&quot;. Trusteeship governs any r resource for the very long term, with no 
right to exploit resources beyond essential needs, or replacement time.</p> 
<p>The way that land passed from clan management to personal ownership is well 
documented; since the year 1400 or thereabouts, the methods used were as in 
Figure 14.14</p> 
<p>Most of us live on lands once tribal, now &quot;owned&quot;. Very few of us 
have any rights to share the resources of such land, which is either state 
(army), church, or corporation-controlled .</p> 
<p>However, with the benefit of scepticism gained from hindsight, many people 
are working to reverse this historical trend; tribes are still forwarding their 
claims to common ground after 200--400 years of occupation, and thousands of 
people are formi11g trusteeship or~anisations to remove land from private 
ownerships, church, and state control, and to return it to use by! those people 
who live on and near the land. In fact, educated people of good will, and 
traditional people, have seen where ownership has ruined common resources, and 
are returning to the concept of taking local-stewardship of the land itself. 
Thus, in the evolution of land concepts, we have Figure 14.15.</p> 
<p>Gifts or deeds of land can be vested in a tax- deductible trust for use by 
a specific group or the public&nbsp; generally, under certain reasonable 
conditions; many&nbsp; community gardens run this way, usually at small rental. 
Many people with large incomes actually benefit from tax-deductible land gifts. 
They can purchase and improve land, and gift it at the improved value at a, 
paper profit.</p> 
<p>Essential land for local food, fuel and structural forestry, recreation, 
and conservation can be planned, and secured under a set of public trusts by 
public investment, gift, bequest, taxdeductible donation, transfer from other 
authorities or trusts, or outright purchase. Thus, the district secures its 
initial land resource. Each and every parcel of land needs 3-4 involved, 
active, and interested trustees, and under a legal limit, its plans and 
purposes should be set for the long-term for 10-50 years ahead). Some qreas 
will be under sports centres, some in trust to conservationists, some under 
lease to organise gardens and farms, and :i some reserved for educational and 
public bodies for public services. Community forestry on steep and rocky I 
lands will provide fuels, food, and buildings for the I future. Even here, 
every household can plant and tend an&nbsp; area, and profit from or manage it; 
it is also an improving asset that can be sold or transferred. This&nbsp; 
works; &quot;public&quot; forestry does not. Industry should grow every stick 
that they use by a charge on product, and investment in the community forestry 
owned by local households. Good models of village forestry are operating in 
Indian and Taiwan; poor models of public forestry are all about us.</p> 
<p>Land trusts need be few, close to settlements, and cover all essential 
uses; the rest of the land can go back to natural forests or prairie. Every 
scrap of land in settlement should first be planned and used. Many, if not 
most, small towns need no other land assets. Any Isociety that develops lawns 
beyond those used for</p> 
<p>PAGE 546&nbsp; FIGURE 14.14 (TRUSTEESHIP OF LAND) <br>
 &nbsp; </p> 
<p>PAGE 547 </p> 
<p>recreation can support itself for wood, fuel, and building materials by the 
conversion of lawn s to use.</p> 
<p>If people who really want land set up adetermined research group on 
&quot;ways and means&quot;, or open an advisory centre on such methords, they 
would achieve their needs much faster and with far less expense than if they 
rely on undertaking a political &quot;revolution&quot; (a transfer of power), 
or saved their pennies, and with much greater longterm benefit to society.</p> 
<p>Just keep in mind that there is more than enough land laready cleared for 
all people, and that it has long ago been paid for in labour or cash; there is 
really no need to buy it again, just the get the right of use. Every country 
has some, or many, methords to obtain usage rights.</p> 
<p>There is usually only one title, or a few titles, nut there are probably 
thousands of possible rights upon any land. Think of the &quot;ownership&quot; 
as a blank canvas or empty wardrobe.We can paint on or hang up an array 
ofrights, and (unless we are very thorough) never fill the land space available.
</p> 
<p>Land in trust can be developed in a number of ways, and can include garden 
clubs, commonworks, and as leased land for specific purposes. Many have water 
conversation, developing forest, wildlife corridors, wetlands, and special 
species reserves as primary aims.</p> 
<p>Practical warnings are not to accept land gifts that have many restrictive 
conditions attached; in fact, it is wise to perhaps limit acceptance to 
unconditional gifts. These can then be sold to purchase more suitable land, or 
to capitalise land elsewhere.</p> 
<p>Secondly, unless a large cash reserve is available, each trust can only 
manage one area of land, and only slowly expand. Every parcel of trust land is 
aunique and longterm development, and if too much land is accepted, simple 
maintenance and land tax costs can bankrupt the trust.</p> 
<p>Above all, a land trust should have a very clear idea of what it wants to 
achieve, and to set a practical time limit to do the job. All trusts need an 
income, and may thus need a business or trading arm. the trust can gift land to 
other regional trusts or associations of whocm it approves, so that local gifts 
can be routed through a tax-deductible trust.</p> 
<p>Why should people give land away? Some of the reasons are: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>To continue land in its use: as an organic farm, wildlife refuge, economic 
botanical garden, or as an excample of good land use.</li> 
<li>Because people believe in trustesship: Many of us do not believe in 
private land ownership, but nin trust ownerships for public use under sound 
environmental control.</li> 
<li>Land is surplus to their needs, and acost: A few people own too much land 
(are what is termed &quot;landpoor&quot;), thus achieve low productivity and 
incur land maintenance costs. By giving some land away (especially to a 
tax-deductible trust) they can concentrate on a smaller productive area. Good 
accounting advice will often dictate that land should be creatively gifted to 
such a trust (i.e. it benefits the giver; this is especially true of donors who 
have a large income from other sources).</li> 
<li>As a bequest: Some good hearted older people will bequeath land, yielding 
up successive rights as they age, to younger landless people or to a land 
trust; this is I form of public bequest, and is a fairly common&nbsp; 
occurrence to establish parks, wildlife areas, or demonstration and teaching 
farms. Trusts can also give Ito other trusts under a bequest basis.<br>
Bcause 
the want a village, or more people on the land: In modern times, nuclear 
families or individuals are socially very isolated on large farms. By 
establishing a land trust, they can legally encourage others to develop parts 
of the property, and so set up a socially rich area with multiple potential.
</li> </ul> 
<p>There are many more reasons why people gift land to&nbsp; trusts, so that 
(generally speaking) there are more lands available than there are reliable 
stewards to occupy them.</p> 
<p>As with money, land ownership and thus land usage in society is unbalanced, 
except where tribal land councils still exist; even in tribes, cattle or 
resource ownership can become unbalanced (as in Botswana, where 9% of the 
people own 80% of the cattle) if crops and herds cease to be tribally owned and 
are privately c owned on common lands.</p> <b></b> 
<p><b>LAND ACCESS OFFICE</b> <br>
 People often complain that they lack access 
to land resources; at the same time, we live in a delinquent or devastated 
landscape. How do we marry needs and land resources? The establishment of a 
regional office (a land access office-LAO) opens up the potential for offering 
a set of strategies enabling better land use, and suited to the finances and 
involvement of people using the service. A selection of strategies follow, and 
can be modified for local conditions:<br>
 &nbsp; </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Landlease system within urban areas; </li> 
<li>Garden or farm club; </li> 
<li>City farms; </li> 
<li>Towns and cities as farms; </li> 
<li>Farm link system; and </li> 
<li>Commonwork. </li> </ul> 
<p>Land lease system within urban areas (Oxfam Model): This is particularly 
suited to young families in rental accommodation. The regional office posts 
paired lists: list A is for those who want 200-1,000 sq. feet of garden to grow 
food. list B comprises those people (usually elderly or absentee landlords) who 
will lease either vacant land or the land around their houses on an annual, 
renewable basis. People list themselves and, as local land comes up, introduce 
themselves. The LAO prepares a standard lease specifying rental (if any), goods 
exchange, length and type of lease, access, and the names of the parties.</p> 
<p>Thus, many young families get legal access to garden land, on an 
&quot;allotment&quot; basis. The regional office may<br>
 &nbsp; </p> 
<p>page 548 </p> 
<p>need to map and actively seek land, and should make a small service charge 
for registration of leases.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;Garden or Fann Club: ,These suit families with some ,apital to invest 
as shares, with annual membership (shares can be sold). A farm is purchased by 
the club or society on a public access route 12 hours from the city. This 
property is designed by the club or society to serve the interests of members, 
whether- for garden, main crop, fuelwood, fishing, recreation, camping, 
commercial growing, or all of these- Depending on the aims and share capital, 
people can lease small areas, or appoint a manager. Rich clubs develop 
motel-style accommo- dation and recreational fisheries. Worker-based clubs 
usually develop private plots with overnight (caravan-style) accommodation for 
weekends. A management committee plans for the whole area (access, water, 
fences, rates, etc) and can be selected by the club.</p> 
<p>Many such clubs exist in Europe, and some in Australia; they offer multiple 
use of one lot of land by many people. Membership in such clubs can be made 
~leable or transferable, and may increase in<br>
 value over lime. </p> 
<p>City Farms: A local group of 100 or more families forms a city farm 
association, and invites local, state, or federal authorities (via their local 
representatives) to allot from 1-80 ha (preferably with a building) to a city 
farm. Such invitations are irresistable to those who hold office by virtue of 
local goodwill or votes.</p> 
<p>On this land, the following activities are promoted: .Demonstration gardens;
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Garden allotments (where space permits); </li> 
<li>Domestic animals (rabbit, pigeon, poultry, sheep, goats, cows, horses) 
kept and used as demonstration and breeding stock;</li> 
<li>Reycling centre for equipment, building materials (income-producing). </li>
<li>Tool rental and access; .Gleaning operations; </li> 
<li>Plant nursery; </li> 
<li>Seminars, demonstrations, training programmes, educational outreach; and 
</li> 
<li>Seed, book, plant, and general retail sales. </li> 
<li>In New York alone, the &quot;Open Space Coalition&quot; counts 1,100 
parcels of land as one or other form of city farm. The Federation of City Fanns 
in the UK numbers some 46 active farms, and many more groups forming at anyone 
time.</li> </ul> 
<p>The essentials of a successful city farm is that it lies in an area of real 
need (poor neighbourhoods), that it has a large local membership, and that it 
offers a wide range of social services to the ,area. Many city farms become 
totally or mainly self-supporting from sales of goods or services, plus modest 
membership fees. The one essential is a long-term legally binding lease. 
Coalitions of such farms represent a large lobby or vote group in society, and 
are therefore. politically respectable!</p> 
<p>Each city farm has a small management group, and most have numerous 
volunteers, or a few paid staff.</p> 
<p>Towns and Cities as Farms: A twist on the above, which can be operated by a 
city farm group. There are several ways to use cities as farms-many German 
towns carry on an active city forestry along roads and on reserves. From 60-80% 
of total city income is thus derived from city forest products.</p> 
<p>Surplus city garden or food product is collected, sorted, packaged, and 
retailed. Some groups collect, grade, and sell citrus or nut crop, and many 
provide young trees to gardeners on contract for later product off the trees. 
Others range sheep, duck, or geese flocks for fire or pest control. All seem to 
make a very good income by treating the city as a specialist farm. A 
processing, shearing, or like facility may be needed by the group.</p> 
<p>Nonprofit groups often collect unwanted food from orchards, canneries, etc. 
and distribute them to the poor, or sell at a small profit to keep running 
costs down. This is known as a &quot;gleaning&quot; system; many thousands of 
tons of unwanted food is so redistributed in the USA. Givers take a tax 
reduction on gift to a gleaning trust (any church or public trust).</p> 
<p>Farm Link (Producer-consumer cooperative): These are appropriate to 
highrise or rental accommodation in an urban area. From 20-50 families link to 
one or more farms in the nearby countryside. Although they can purchase and 
manage a property, they usually come to an arrangement with an already 
established market gardener. Quarterly meetings are held between both parties 
to work out what products can be trucked direct from the farm to the families, 
who use the product and can retail any surplus to others.</p> 
<p>The farmer adjusts production to suit family needs, and as the 
&quot;link&quot; grows, the system can also accommodate holidays on the farm, 
educational workshops, and city help on the farm at peak work periods (planting 
and harvesting).</p> 
<p>This strategy enables us to build compact urban areas while retaining 
farmlands that are uncluttered by settlement. The alternative (as in Australia, 
the USA, and increasingly in Europe) is for cities to become sprawling 
monstrosities of suburbs that reduce whole production areas to lawns and rotary 
clotheslines, and forests and trees to chopsticks and newspapers, while 
over-extending public utilies and creating insolvable transport and waste 
probiems.</p> 
<p>The system is best developed in Japan, although scattered examples operate 
elsewhere for products as diverse as fish and game, wheat and firewood. 
Benefits are numerous:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Producers have an assured market at a mutually agreed price set a year 
ahead.</li> 
<li>Consumers can reduce costs to below wholesale by assisting with harvest. 
</li> 
<li>Townspeople can access farm facilities; this is valuable education for 
children.<br>
 The&nbsp; system is convivial; in fact its main aims are to 
develop friendships.<br>
 &nbsp; </li> 
<li>Consumers control quality and quantity by pre-order and stated preference. 
</li> </ul> 
<p><br>
PAGE 549 <br>
<br>
 &nbsp; </p> 
<p>Commonwork systems: Any, tribe or even an individual farmer can allow 
mutiple land use by setting up a commonwork system, akin to the African mahisa 
or kivestock loan system of Botswana.</p> 
<p>Briefly, the land area is closely assessed for earth resources, wildlife, 
forest and aquaculture potentioal, small and large livestock (bees to 
bullocks), arable land and mixed orchard, and socio-educational potentional. 
The local nees to primary processing, building, and consultancy or 
implementation servies can also be researched.</p> 
<p>This basic design work completed, the trust or owners can advertise locally 
for people to run any one of these enterprises with levels ranging from that of 
a hobby (developing a butterfly forage system) to a fulltime occupation income 
(a trout farm).Proper legal saeguards (lease documents) setting out rights of 
use, length of lease, responsibilities of the trust and lessee, and terms of 
payment (adjustable, but usually 10% of gross income) are&nbsp;&nbsp; drawn up 
to safeguard users. This 10% credited to the donor, forms a cpital fund 
together with any capital raised by the trust or the lessees (some as grants or 
gifts, some as business loans).The trust also needs income for maintaining 
services such as roads, fences, power, and to pay land taxes.</p> 
<p>All lessees are selfemployed; land costs are minimal (their share of 
services) and land costs access is secure. As enterprises develop, the capital 
fund enables further research and development. It is ideal to plan so that any 
one enterprise (energy supply, bees, tree nursery) helps so supply others, as 
well as regional needs. More than one farm or tust can join in a commonwork 
system; the trust or land owners set broad conditons of sustainable use, and 
allot space or resources to enterprises, but the contributors to the capital 
fund vote in their own cash management group. Such a landuse system promises 
full and beneficial use of lands, and can take up much of the unemployment in a 
district.</p> 
<p>However, commonworks need to be close to towns or on a public transport 
route, so that townspeople can</p> 
<p>PAGE 550 </p> 
<p>participate; remote areas do not suit this system unless It is paired with 
a village development. Commonwork members are free to leave, sellout to new 
lessees, and eventually be refunded their 10%, less base main- lenanceand 
service costs, but plus any interest paid.</p> 
<p>All occupations can be &quot;open&quot; , available to all, but a 
proportion of occupations (adjusted to that proportion of the society that 
needs such work to be available) can &quot;beassigned to specifically 
disadvantaged groups at the ttlme of life or state of health where such work is 
perhaps the only possible useful work one can do. In Turkey, for instance, the 
totally blind have the sole right<br>
 to sell pigeon food in public places; 
this gives them an independent income. There are hundreds of such essentially 
minor incomes available in every society for&nbsp; otherwise-neglected groups 
or ages.</p> 
<p>&quot;Livings&quot; are occupations which return a living wage to a family. 
The fair assessment of these rest in family size, especially the number of 
dependents, base costs in the society, and frugality of the family unit. The 
need to earn is most reduced by a set of strategies ranging from gardens for 
food, efficient use of energy in house and work, shaiing of basic equipment, 
and membership of fbulk purchasing groups.</p> 
<p>Although many employees (unfortunate people) are paid to do only one job, 
members of a common work can take up many occupations, the net return from 
which afford a living plus some net profit for local investment as a tithe on 
earnings.</p> 
<p>In the Mondragon system, actual cash or income differentials are limited in 
the ratio 1 :4 or 5; that is to say, a sweeper cannot receive less than 25% of 
the total wage of a doctor; this is a good basis for adjusting any ethical 
sharing in any system. If people, via education, retraining, or selfhelp can 
improve their skills, their political mobility (not fixed castes) can allow 
them to improve their relative earning capacity, although not beyond a fair 
differential relative to their community.</p> 
<p>In the concept of commonwork we have arrived at a new synthesis, a future 
model not only for farms but for complex small communities. Although tribal 
peoples had (and have) a clear idea of total<br>
 ecologies-the sum of fire, 
regrowth, wallaby, and pioneer fire species-arid although they had a word for 
this, there is no word-concept for a &quot;total human family &quot; 
ecology&quot; beyond &quot;a living&quot;.</p> 
<p>In my meaning of &quot;a living&quot;, it is the beekeeper, the ,bees, 
their water, flowers, pollen, propolis, and the means to make the beehives. It 
is a clear legal access to forage, and a registered and secure bee site; and it 
is the tight to sell or market product to pay for other Ijfe needs. ln fact, it 
is a human ecological totality, provided with abstract and real self-reliance, 
and sufficient to pay for any tuition, travel, health service, and insurance 
needed by the family accessing a living.</p> 
<p>This right, and many similar rights, overlay all landscapes, all societies, 
but can only be designed to be beneficial if that society (or that segment of 
society who want self-reliance) entrust their lands and lives to a 
public-interest deed of trust, and also trust each other to carry out a 
function. In fact, common work systems based on a social edifice of 
responsibility to and for others. For a nation-state, taxes were perhaps 
intended to supply social needs, whereas in fact they have always been used to 
raise armies and enrich a minority far beyond the needs of a living; to create 
wealth for a few, and privelege for bureaucrats.</p> 
<p>If taxes were not in fact so used, we would all live in a society where the 
need to work would be negligible, and both employment and unemployment (thus, 
workers and owners) absent. Employment, like suburbs and institutions such as 
gaols, are as modern as lawns and politics; all ancient societies of people 
arranged life without any of these impediments, but only by seeing life as 
livings, and living things as basic to life.</p> 
<p>A short list of developmental design programs for a commonwork land trust 
is as follows:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Priority 1 :: Maximise water storage by constructions of Keyline, swale, 
soil conditioning, ridge forestry, and broad canals or dams for diversion and 
irrigation.</li> 
<li>Priority 2: Specify forest sites and forest types, allowing specific 
forage forests for locally acceptable or endemic animal species-</li> 
<li>Priority 3: Specify crop areas for orchard and perennial crop, based on 
best soils, low slopes, windbreaks, and water access.</li> 
<li>Priority 4:: Specify complex access and trackways, critical edges for 
flowers, bee fodders, trellis systems, wayside crop.</li> 
<li>Other: Select a few caretaker house sites if necessary, and designate and 
stockpile earth materials if and as these are discovered in earth works. Check 
history and archaelogy, and keep a journal and open plan of all development.
</li> 
<li>Probable livelihoods for 100 ha, 40 or more families: .Bees </li> 
<li>Poultry </li> 
<li>Ducks </li> 
<li>Fisnspecies </li> 
<li>Forage systems </li> 
<li>Fuel forestry </li> 
<li>Structural forestry </li> 
<li>Cut flowers </li> 
<li>Nursery </li> 
<li>Methane and wind et'ergy systems, solar systems (manufacture and power 
sales)</li> 
<li>Accommodation and tours </li> 
<li>Workshops and field days </li> 
<li>Training programmes </li> 
<li>Cooperative store </li> 
<li>Credit union </li> 
<li>Insurance <br>
 Leasing </li> 
<li>Processing of raw materials to pottery, bricks, dried, pickled and smoked 
food products.</li> </ul> 
<p>All of this asserts that we are not &quot;just clerks&quot; or &quot;just 
housewives&quot; but that we have many r()les in any free society. Our freedoms 
are, in fact, a choice of those chains of responsibility or social dllties with 
which we<br>
 &nbsp; </p> 
<p>PAGE 551 </p> 
<p>feel comfortable-not the freedom to do nothing, or to do what we like (to 
be self-serving)-but the<br>
 freedom to choose among occupations-the portfolio 
of self-expression, work or duties that we in fact<br>
 do evolve in 
non-hierarchical societies, villages, and tribes.</p> 
<p>Thus, more iormal cooperatives need to include retraining, education, and 
work mobility for their ,<br>
 membership, or risk frustration and boredom with 
r work, The work factor itself can include some<br>
 proportion of time or 
output devoted to social services generally, so that everyone feels that they 
are<br>
 contributing to their society as a whole. The very concepts of 
employment/unemployment deny thIs<br>
 potential, and again frustrate people so 
that rebellion as strikes or riots follow. Guilds and unions (in<br>
 the sense 
{of trades) may actually reinforce this sense of irrevocable fate (no choice), 
as do caste<br>
 systems in India. </p> 
<p>Thus, in bioregional networks, commonworks, and intentional villages, the 
individual can choose a set<br>
 of lduties and occupations that fit skills, 
choice, and age. A few also develop special skills and<br>
 become teachers in 
trades or disciplines.<br>

<b>AN ETHICAL INVESTMENT MOVEMENT</b> </p> 
<p>Prior to 1980, very few innovative or consciously ethical legally 
structured to be so) financial systems<br>
 existed; totay there are hundreds 
of such organisations, holding their own summits and handling, via<br>
 
their&nbsp; stockbrokers, in excess of 160 billion dollars annually (in the USA 
alone), Many other such<br>
 organisations exist JIn Europe, Australia, New 
Zealand, India and southeast Asia.</p> 
<p>In 1983, the Permaculture Institute, following 'seminas with the E. F, 
Schumacher group in the USA,<br>
 Carted teaching in local community funding 
and ethical investment' &quot;banking on the earth&quot;. Any local<br>
 group 
is able to set up a resource list of data from models, to invite fund managers 
to visit their region<br>
 to give seminars, and to adopt or devise local 
financial recycling systems, ethical brokerages, or<br>
 non-monetary community 
exchange.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;A local &quot;earthbank&quot; group is at first a research, 
'teaching, or seminar convening organisation, but as<br>
 local money systems 
are established, some members obtain employment by running financial,<br>
 
exchange, or barter systems. In the UK, USA, Australia, and Canada, annual 
seminars (in the UK<br>
 called &quot;The Other. e mic Summit&quot;- TOES) are 
now convened to hear from advisors and fund<br>
 managers, and to supply 
education or materials to new groups. If no such summits exist in your area,<br>
 convene one; we started with only 12 people in Australia, but 60-100 
interested people and<br>
 organisations now attend these seminars, and banks, 
insurance companies, cooperatives, and<br>
 credit unions send representatives 
to assist new groups.</p> 
<p>The rise of a large, popular, efficient set of services to livert public 
money to good ends (and get it<br>
 back) is a reaction to (or revulsion with) 
the current misuse of noney by governments, large aid<br>
 agencies, and 
rapacious investors whose sole motive is profit, power, or greed, This movement 
is one<br>
 of the truly new phenomena of this century, and its growth is 
exponential.</p> 
<p>The large amount of investment capital redirected hrough ethical brokerages 
is the tip of an iceberg<br>
 which involves many thousands of ordinary people 
who are members of guarantee circles, ethical<br>
 credit mions,community loans 
trusts, common fund agencies or bioregions, or non formal systems of<br>
 
labour and workday exchanges, barter systems, direct market systems, or 
no-interest, pre-purchase,<br>
 &quot;green dollar&quot; systems, </p> 
<p>Moreover, existing banks, credit unions, cooperatives, businesses, and 
allied groups are discussing<br>
 the rewriting of their charters to include 
the values of earth care, people care, and the production of<br>
 socially 
useful or socilally sensitive) products, Some credit unions and banks already 
have such a<br>
 charter, and keep corporate watchdogs on the staff whose sole 
job it is to monitor companies for<br>
 unethical behaviour. Not only 
corporations but volunteer groups and consumer groups produce<br>
 monitoring 
publications on multinationals on a global scale, and publish 
&quot;nonbuyers&quot;<br>
 guides of the products of unethical organisations. 
</p> 
<p>The negative (&quot;non-buy&quot;) emphasis of the early years involved 
disinvestment in companies which:<br>
 DO NOT CARE FOR THE EARTH, producing: 
<br> &nbsp; </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Pollutants and dangerous wastes, waste product as 'xcess packaging, and 
nonreturnable or not recyclable containers,</li> 
<li>Shoddy and quickly superseded products, Inrepairable items, or those 
lacking good servicing and spares,</li> 
<li>Poisons, biocides, armaments, and dangerous materials (radioactive waste, 
mercury, asbestos, leaded&nbsp; petrol, chlorinated fluorocarbons in insulation 
or spray cans, radioactive paints and so on.</li> </ul> 
<p>DO NOT CARE FOR PEOPLE, as assessed by: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Dangerous foods or medicines, </li> 
<li>Have unsafe or polluted workplaces; this includes loise pollution. </li> 
<li>Deal in addictive substances or provide addictive ervices (alcohol, 
tobacco, gambling).</li> 
<li>Do not permit organised labour, do not deal with mployees on a fair basis, 
nor pay fair wages,</li> 
<li>Exploit people directly via slavery, bonded labour, xcessive profit 
margins, by forms of prostitution, racial nd sexual discrimination, or 
harassment,.</li> 
<li>Support or cooperate with regimes using torture or mprisonment without 
charge, dictatorships, corrupt regimes restricting voting, disenfranchising 
people by gerrymander, or by allowing votes only to certain groups.</li> </ul> 
<p><br>
 PAGE 552 </p> 
<p>D0 NOT SHOW A PUBLIC CONSCIENCE </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Use bribery and price-fixing. </li> 
<li>Operate on excessive profits. </li> 
<li>Monopolise resources or markets. </li> 
<li>Do not themselves invest in ethical groups. </li> </ul> 
<p>As the ethical investment movement matures, however, this negative approach 
is evolving into a very<br>
 positive search for, and willingness to fund and 
support (or establish), enterprises which:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>.Assist conservation and reduce waste (not treat waste and so grow to 
depend on more wastes) or energy use</li> 
<li>Grow clean food free of biocides or dangerous levels of contaminants. </li>
<li>Are involved in community reafforestation. </li> 
<li>Build energy conserving houses or villages. </li> 
<li>Produce clean transport or energy systems. </li> 
<li>Assist peoples self-reliance. </li> 
<li>Found cooperatives, self-employed ventures, or profit-sharing systems. 
</li> 
<li>Produce durable, sound, useful and necessary products. </li> </ul> 
<p>Thus, local or bioregional funds can establish small or large enterprises 
necessary to that region,<br>
 using money raised by residents. Brokers or 
enterprise trusts can direct surplus investment to<br>
 socially and 
environmentally responsible industries and developments such as new, 
well-designed<br>
 villages. All such ethical organisations state their 
criteria in their legal or informal charters.</p> 
<p>RECOMMENDED TYPES OF INVESTMENTS <br>
 Investments need to be staggered in 
terms of ultimate return, so that some money is always on call.<br>
 To these 
ends, a set of loans or investments can be scattered over short to long term 
enterprises, e.g.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Short Term: Loans for draught-proofing, insula- tion, attached glasshouse, 
clean water tanks, trickle irrigation, and dam building. All amortise in from 
1-2 yeas, some in much shorter time (one winter). Also, loans can be given to 
good local industries with careful management and market assessment.</li> 
<li>Medium Term:. Bee, chicken, and pig forage systems plus stock, large water 
catchments for aquaculture, irrigation; nurseries, subdivi~ions, tours and 
tourism, buying and selling farms after environmental rehabilitation; larger 
local industries or their expansion; clean power systems.</li> 
<li>Long Term: Town and city reconstruction or development; fuel crop and 
processing; small farm development; large-scale property retrofit; orchard 
establishment; research into new energy forms.</li> 
<li>Permanent: Forestry, and the purchase of natural remnant forest (shares 
can be traded as values increase over the long term); wildlife reserves and 
rainforest in good condition (as revalued property trusts,&nbsp; dedicated to 
species preservation).</li> </ul> 
<p>We can order investment value under some such simple system as follows: <br>
 1.&nbsp; Active e.g.&nbsp; a group of people investing in reafforestation, and 
working in that area.<br>
 2. Passive e.g. buying the products of an ethical 
company<br>
 3. Neutral e.g. funding a film which may have no message, ethical 
or otherwise.<br>
 4. Unethical e.g. retailing dangerous and persistent 
pesticides or herbicides.</p> 
<p>This gives us a set of priorities based on &quot;greatest effect and 
involvement&quot;. Category 4 above is, of<br>
 course, not permitted by any 
ethical charter, and Category 3 need be funded only when other needs<br>
 are 
satisfied.</p> 
<p>We are acting at our best level and have the greatest chance of success (or 
least chance of failure)<br>
 when we are active workers In, and consumers of, 
the products or services that we fund. Within the<br>
 &quot;active&quot; 
category (1 above), we can set priorities based on local or current problems in 
the biosocial<br>
 context of the times. Today these would be: </p> 
<p>Biological: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>The prevention of soil deterioration, i.e. soil creation. </li> 
<li>The prevention of deforestation, i.e. afforestation </li> 
<li>Conservation of species, i.e. creation of species reserves </li> </ul> 
<p>Environmental: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Preserving the quality of air, i.e. pollution control.. .Reduction of 
waste, i.e. recycling and elimination of waste products.</li> 
<li>Cleaning up water i.e. water storages and disinvestment in polluting 
industries.</li> </ul> 
<p>There is no implication in the above list that any investment fund should 
fund industries based on<br>
 (relying on) the production of wastes. </p> 
<p>Wherever a body of laws has been formed on the basis of the responsibility 
of people to their environ-<br>
 ment, a dynamic, long-maintained, and 
relatively harmless occupancy of the earth has resulted. I<br>
 cannot think of 
any better examples than the long-term tribal occupancies of deserts, 
rainforests, and<br>
 prairies. </p> 
<p>But wherever a body of laws has been formed based on our &quot;rights&quot; 
to property, to protect material<br>
 resources and accumulations, and to 
permit destruction of the public resource, we will not only<br>
 destroy whole 
environments and species, but in the end ourselves.</p> 
<p>It is already unlawful to clear forests in South Australia, to light fires 
in many areas, or to destroy<br>
 protected wildlife, trees, or reserves in 
many countries; but we can murder with impunity by using<br>
 biocides, destroy 
whole forests with acid rain, destroy the ozone layer, and risk sea level rise 
without<br>
 penalty. Many organisations are demanding that this too changes, 
and that those responsible are<br>
 charged with the damage, as people bereft 
of social conscience; we may yet live to see a class of<br>
 corporate 
criminals brought to book for their conscious crimes.</p> 
<p>Auditing is the periodic assessment of the validity of any financial 
enterprise or investment strategy.<br>
 Whereas conventional financial systems 
propose a</p> 
<p>PAGE&nbsp; 553 </p> 
<p>single economic criteria to such audits, I propose that we of the 
alternative nation apply three criteria:</p> 
<p>1. The economic audit: &quot;Where did the money go? Was it honestly used? 
Is the system economically<br>
 viable?&quot; (The European audit) <br>
 2. The 
ethical audit: &quot;Was the enterprise concerned with its ethical (people 
care) accounting? Did the<br>
 enterprise benefit people in the long run? 
&quot; (The Iroquois audit)<br>
 3. The environmental audit: &quot;Were the 
activities life-enancing? Is the earth therefore more productive in<br>
 terms 
of life forms? &quot;(The Pitjatjantjara or &quot;life increase&quot;audlt)</p> 
<p>Active and Passive InVestment Involvement <br>
 Many investors never see or 
experience the systems they fund via brokerages. As the ethical<br>
 investment 
process evolves, many more projects involving investors as residents, builders, 
primary<br>
 producers, or suppliers of goods and services can be developed 
Bioregional funds do, in fact, offer their<br>
 investors chance to at least 
define the sort of goods they wan produced in their region, at the quality<br>
 
level the would prefer. As an example, the development of permaculture village 
does just that; the<br>
 shares (not identical units) actually fund the whole 
developmen including a common development fund,<br>
 a local revolving loan 
fund, commercial and light industrial leases; areas are also set aside for 
primary<br>
 producer regional markets, recreation, conservation, and energy 
reserves. The process of village<br>
 development has been outlined herein; in 
such developments every resident can be a participant at<br>
 most levels. </p> 
<p>We should, I feel, discourage passive investment; all brokers can introduce 
investors and producers in<br>
 mutually supportive web. There is no inducemel 
greater than self-interest, and self-interest dictates that every investor 
should use, assist in, and consume the products and services they invest in. 
Investment centres should be active in person-to-person introduction-even 
investment parties!</p> 
<p>Analysis of those sections of society and managed funds that prop up the 
whole investment system<br>
 mea identifying the source of such funds. 
Retirement fun (superannuation), union funds, insurance<br>
 funds, a common 
trust funds are all large sources of investment monies; it is wise, therefore, 
to include representatives of or contributors to such funds in earthbank 
societies, and to invite them to ethical investment conferences.</p> 
<p>After all, why should coal miners' union funds pay for the takeover that 
closes down their colliery, ratther than the forest development funds that 
offers them, retraining as foresters (and forests will be need forever!) Only 
the corruption of fund managers would prevent such sensible provision for 
future work, and corruption cannot be exposed without investor pressure. Why 
should an insurance company hi money in motor vehicle manufacturers 
producing&nbsp; unsafe or faulty vehicles? Why,should we fund oun destruction 
when the alternative is wide open for profitable, ethical development?</p> 
<p>Proportional lnvestment <br>
 If one has $100, how should this be spread 
about to do the most good with the least risk? This is a matter of personal 
choice or good advice, but some sensible propositions area:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>10% to risk ventures (new ideas, new ventures) </li> 
<li>10% 20% to a local S.H.A.R.E. programme or credit union as community 
development funds.</li> 
<li>10%20% in any existing clean public power utility. </li> 
<li>20%40% in a social investment fund. </li> 
<li>10% to a public interest investment (School, hospital, research centre). 
</li> </ul> 
<p>Thus the risk is spread widely, home and regional assets funded, and public 
services supported. This<br>
 can also alter as new opportunities arise, but 
like self-employment, money should cover a wide<br>
 portfolio of ventures. </p>
<p>Investment Sources <br>
 A good many people inherit, earn, or win sums of. 
money from $1,000-100,000 surplus to their<br>
 present needs. They do not want 
to invest in their own destruction by supporting polluting or addictive 
industries,&nbsp; and instead seek socially responsible investment. Another 
class of investors are members of churches and organisations which profess an 
ethic of peace and goodwill. These groups also need to place surplus funds in 
organisations which work towards their aims. Various lay bodies such as the 
Sierra Club, Friends of&nbsp; the Earth, and organic growers have funds to 
place in investment for at least short periods, and cannot always trust the 
local banks, which invest in adversary systems or which do not reveal their 
investment policy publicly.</p> 
<p>In fact, everybody who uses a bank to store money is an investor by 
default, and if unaware of the<br>
 bank's investment strategy, may most 
probably be investing (via the bank) in systems which are creating local 
problems or global disorder. Thus, it is necessary to l' locate or found 
ethical investment groups and put our money with them.</p> 
<p>About 70% of the total &quot;free world&quot; investment is American, and 
of the 70%, the majority (or about<br>
 40% of the total) is in the hands of 
women, who tend to&nbsp; inherit as well as save. It is obviously<br>
 
important for&nbsp; womens' groups to direct this money to life-enhancing ; 
enterprises. Thus, at least one<br>
 of our &quot;minority&quot; groups can 
invest in their own salvation, and also change the wortd, not only without 
losing money but in fact&nbsp; getting more return from regenerative investment 
than&nbsp; from the death system. For example, as stated in , CoEvolution 
Quarterly, Summer '83, p. 91, investment returns for public utilities supplying 
power were as follows:<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Nuclear based stocks appreciated 24% ..<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Mixed groups (some nuclear) 52%<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Non-nuclear power utilities 82%<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Dividends for those groups were 30%,59% and 81% respectively. It is now certain 
that socially responsible</p> 
<p>page 554 </p> 
<p>investment pays. We can also make it cost to be socially .Irresponsible by 
withdrawing investments<br>
 from , ethical groups, Socially sensitive 
investments not&nbsp; only pay better, but are basically an insurance against 
(rather than susceptible to) stock market crashes, as local facilities are 
always important in hard times, arId local investments do not crash.</p> 
<p>As money begins to flow to regional and socially responsible funds, even 
those people not personally<br>
 persuaded of the need to invest in the future 
will have cause to think about investing in unethical<br>
 systems from which 
public and financial support is being withdrawn, Pursued vigorously as a 
strategy,<br>
 reinvestment in ethical systems can change the total direction 
of capital flow towards beneficial<br>
 systems. </p> 
<p>Some Strategies for Investment in the Environment <br>
 Recently 
third-world debt (heavily discounted by the creditor bank as apoor investment, 
so that one can buy $1,000,000 of debt for $120,000 of cash) has been purchased 
by conservationists (via a tax-deductible trust such as the World Wildlife 
Fund, or one of many conservationist societies), For this debt, the trust asks 
not for repayment of capital and interest in hard currency, but in forest or 
wetland assets in the debtor country.</p> 
<p>In this way, everybody benefits: the banks, the debtor nation, the 
environment, and the purchasers;<br>
 moreover&nbsp; the wildlife and forest 
reserves so purchased can be sensitively developed for nature, tourism and 
research rather than being cut down for debt repayment. The whole world 
benefits from forests, and such benign strategies need to be operated on the 
widest possible scale. This is not so difficult, as almost every world&nbsp; 
nation except perhaps Japan, Botswana (diamonds), and Nauru {rock phosphate) is 
today a debtor nation and few have any hope of repaying their debts-such is the 
stupidity of governments and banks that invest in corruption and exploitation 
(note that ethical funds don't share in the stock market crashes if they hold 
real assets that support sel!-reliance).</p> 
<p>It is also possible to deposit funds with a tax- deductible trust, which 
purchases critical or species-<br>
 rich areas discounted by farmer debt or by 
misuse or overcutting {salted and eroded lands). By putting<br>
 aside a sum 
for management, income can be made from wildlife reserves, seed, or new 
forests. In the<br>
 case of capable farmers, they can themselves be appointed 
as co-managers, and many would gladly<br>
 accept this role in restoration and 
earth care. Many good farmers are made bankrupt by trying to<br>
 restore land 
to health!</p> 
<p>Investors can do the same for a public (for-profit) trust that reassesses 
its share prices annually. As a<br>
 property is developed with lakes, forests, 
and wildlife, 80 its value increases, and the increased share<br>
 value can be 
traded, It is in such restoration work that management teams (some of them<br>
 
co-investors, by an issue of shares for labour) can test their rehabilitation 
skills, as outljn~tI in this<br>
 book and elsewhere in the land restoration 
literature.</p> 
<p>Company takeovers or raids are often used to enrich ruthless individuals by 
&quot;assetstripping&quot;-selling off<br>
 a public company's assets and 
keeping the profits, regardless of the effects on the work force or<br>
 
national economy. However, the same methodology can be used by 
conservationminded takeover<br>
 teams, who &quot;strip&quot; polluting 
companies, and develop land and urban assets to serve the needs of the<br>
 
society and of nature. Many failing logging companies have vast areas of 
degraded lands suited to<br>
 small forest farm operations, and would-be forest 
farmers would love to manage a small area of forest<br>
 properly, as would 
many theoreti- cal botanists and academics who have 1ong known how to develop
<br> a forest for eternal yield, but never had the land or capital to do so. 
</p> 
<p>By these and other methods; the public can start to go to work via the 
normal financial and market<br>
 procedures of the capitalist world to set 
their environment in order, to preserve species, and to<br>
 educate and train 
an effective work force in assuming control for good purposes.</p> <b><i></i>

<p><i><b>TOTAL APPROACHES TO FINANCE IN SOCIETY</b></i> <br>
 Margrit Kennedy 
(in a manuscript Toward an Ecological. Economy: money, land and tax reforms, 
Oct.<br>
 1987) is convinced that an interest-free financial system is not only 
the sole sustainable medium for<br>
 exchange, but that such a &quot;no 
growth&quot; fiscal system encourages and preserves all natural resources.<br>
 
It would at one stroke abolish the condition where the third world and the poor 
in affluent countries<br>
 payout more in interest than it has received in 
loans, pre.vent the growth of a minority wealthy elite,<br>
 and stabilise 
resource use.</p> 
<p>In everything we use there are hidden interest costs:. about 12% of garbage 
cQllection charges, 38% of drinking water charges, and 77% of social housing 
charges are accountable as interest. The gains go to the rich or lenders, and 
the losses to the poor or borrowers even though the earth may provide the 
wealth of their labour (the production sphere). This wealth is removed by 
interest charges in the fiscal or circulation sphere. Thus, wealth used by 
unethical investment strategies is rapidly transferred via global stock or 
money markets to most efficiently exploit the poor; a wry comment on the people 
devising or running such systems.</p> 
<p>The gross imbalance of wealth promotes &quot;big&quot; spending in 
capital-consuming but publicly paid<br>
 investments (big dams, big power 
stations, big housing corporations) where governments refer the<br>
 costs to 
the people. In the end, only military (waste) funding can use all this 
misbegotten wealth. So,<br>
 sensible smallscale and cost--effective solutions 
are prevented or actively discouraged by<br>
 governments and fiscal managers 
alike.</p> 
<p>With no or very low interest rates, people buy goods at a steady rate, and 
industries do not need to be<br>
 geared to cope with the fluctuations in 
market caused by the sw.ings inherent in a global money<br>
 supply which 
starves some regions and floods others with only a profit motive in mind. These 
goods<br>
 or services need </p> 
<p>PAGE&nbsp;&nbsp; 555 </p> 
<p>about a 5% maintenance cost, just to pay for repairs or people to run the 
system. It only needs any<br>
 town, region, or nation to set up such a 
constant system to put right many social and ecological ills.<br>
 This was, in 
fact, the system tried successfully by some small Austrian towns in the 1930's
<br> depression; as such systems strengthen and grow, so regions can stabilise 
and pay for all their<br>
 essential longterm resources. </p> 
<p>At any rate, the present system is in the process of collapse, and the new 
barter systems are<br>
 expanding; the only question we have is if the life 
support systems of earth will still be intact, or<br>
 whether sanity in fiscal 
affairs will be delayed until no human survival is possible on a polluted earth.

<b>FUTURES</b> </p> 
<p>I have borrowed, in part, from the publications of the infant world 
regional and familial alliances to detail (as a thematic structure) those 
global problems and local disturbances that will concern all of us over the 
next few decades. These are</p> 
<p>.ENVIRONMENTAL DETERIORATION. <br>
 A. Desertification, under the topics of:
<br> 1. Deforestation. <br>
 2. Water balance disturbance. <br>
 3. Soil 
salting and collapse.<br>
 4. Overgrazing. </p> 
<p>.POLLUTION. <br>
 A. Of the atmosphere, leading to acid rain and climatic 
change.<br>
 B. Of soils via chemical waste. <br>
 C. By radioactives in the 
soil and food chains.<br>
 D. Of inland and fresh waters. <br>
 E. Of the 
estuaries and marine systems.<br>
 F. Of food by biocides, radiation. </p> 
<p>.THE EXTINCTION OF NATURAL SYSTEMS AND SPECIES. <br>
 A. By rainforest 
destruction.<br>
 B. By desertification of arid area borders. <br>
 C. By 
clearing for agriculture.<br>
 D. By draining wetlands. </p> 
<p>.CLIMATIC CHANGES. <br>
 A. Heating of earth by ('~rhon dioxide and gaseous 
pollutants in the global atmosphere.<br>
 1. Rising sea levels <br>
 2. 
Reduction of stratospheric ozone.<br>
 3. Intensification of local ozone at 
ground level.<br>
 4. Acidic particles leading to acid rain. </p> 
<p>.SOCIO-POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CON- cERNs. <br>
 A. The use of torture and 
imprisonment for repression of people; arrest or detention without charge or<br>
 public trial.<br>
 B. The continuous oppression of minority ethnic, language, 
cultural, or tribal peoples.<br>
 C. Corruption, and the misuse of public 
monies by selfinterest groups.<br>
 D. Replacement of crafts and skills with 
machines and mass production.<br>
 E. Intolerable employment; unsafe, 
unhealthy, waste-productive .<br>
 F. Essentially short-term solutions to 
long-term, chronic problems.<br>
 G. Cash resources sequestered via addiction 
and crime.</p> 
<p>.DIREcrLY HUMAN CONCERNS <br>
 A. Meaningful work (employment in right 
livelihood).<br>
 B. Adequate nutrition. <br>
 C. Adequate and easily 
maintained (low-energy shelter.<br>
 D. Access to a land base for sustenance. 
<br> E. Access to finance for development. </p> 
<p>.RESEARCH AND SCIENTIFIC CONCERNS <br>
 A. The perversion of science to 
assist war, torture, oppression.<br>
 B. The lack of common, practical 
translation of scientific findings to those who can use the informa-<br>
 tion. 
<br> C. The ineffectiveness of researchers in applying findings and obtaining 
feedback.<br>
 D. Setting priorities for research via morbidity and global 
analyses, and funding such priorities.<br>
 E. The monopolisation of socially 
useful inventions by patents, especially in seed and technology.</p> 
<p>In everyone of the above categories, effective solutions to the stated 
problems exist, have beeh<br>
 applied, and have solved that problem locally or 
even nationally. Some are imperfect and need<br>
 adjustment, others work in 
the context of specific cultures or landscapes, while a lesser number are<br>
 
effective across the whole range of specific phenomena. But in almost every 
case, &quot;case histories&quot; of<br>
 solutions are not locally available 
over the range of current problems. Any such library of solutions<br>
 needs an 
educational outreach. Educational programmes themselves need orientation to 
practical<br>
 problem-solving using successful models. </p> 
<p>Modifying all climatic and plant data given herein is the global warming 
effect and stratospheric ozone<br>
 loss now expected to continue for the 
foreseeable future. This will mean increased air and seawater<br>
 tempera- 
tures, the extension of typhoons and monsoon rains away from the equator towards
<br> Latitudes 20-25&amp;deg;, drier winters in western coastal and southwest 
Mediterran- ean climates, and a<br>
 general increase in carbon dioxide, hence 
increased plant growth in the semiarid areas of tropical<br>
 deserts. </p> 
<p>As a background to any trends such as global warming, the basic llyear (22 
year) sunspot cycle, and</p> 
<p>PAGE&nbsp; 556 </p> 
<p>more importantly the 18.6 year lunar cycle (the latter affecting the shift 
north or south of cyclonic systems, the former affecting incoming radiation) 
will continue to determine drought and wet years. Such factors are now firmly 
tied to food crises and drought in most continents (new scientist 8 Oct 87, 
p.28)<br>
 The lunar atmospheric tide is the overriding effect, and the chief 
collator of such data (Robert Currie, State University of New York, Stonybrook, 
N.Y. USA) warns of agricultural shortages in the northern hemisphere in 
1990-92. These years will be wet in the year 2009 or thereabouts. Thus, 
governements and farmers can plan to reduce herds, store grains, increase tree 
crop, enlarge or increase water storages and swales, and select plant crop 
species for such regular or cyclic variations. At present, Africa is in 
drought, and Europe in a flood cycle, every 9+ years this reverses.</p> 
<p>It is now time to diversify bioregional resources to afford a flexible 
response to these changes. Such preprations may mean that several strategies 
need to applied including;<br>
 &nbsp; </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Assessment of the local and national relief, and sea level rise effects in 
every region. For example, most low islands may be at some risk, while lowlying 
cities and coasts can be either evaculated or portected (at great cost).</li> 
<li>Extension of hurricane-proof housing design to Latitudes 30&amp;deg; north 
and south.</li> 
<li>Preparation for much hotter climactic factors both in gardens and homes 
(from 8-12 oC warmer in mesothermal areas, from 1-5&amp;deg;C warmer in the 
tropics), thus far greater attention to high tree and palm canopy, insulation, 
building ventilation, and shadehouses.</li> 
<li>Increases of 16-25%in ultraviolet radiation, hence a change in human 
activity, and clothing. Animal breeds, resistant to heat effects, need to be 
selected now.</li> 
<li>A generally more mixed ecology with many more forest components in both 
urban and rural areas, including species from warmer regions.</li> 
<li>As for future occupational changes and migrations, there will need to be 
far more emphasis on home gardens or city farms, specialist crop, forestry, and 
local processing for regional needs, as no one can ensure continued 
agricultural food supply or industrial crop sustainability.</li> 
<li>Just to halt or modify the worst aspects of the current atmospheric 
trends, there is no doubt that any nation wishing to survive will redirect 
public and private investment monies into sustainable practices, and ban many 
substances and industries. For example:</li> 
<li>Biocide residues will be disallowed in food, water, and soils, and thus 
only sophisticated biological controls will apply on farms. Many chlorine 
products will be discontinued, as well as plastics such as polystyrene.</li> 
<li>Padi rice and feed-lot beef will be disallowed or eliminated as major 
pollutants, and supplemented with less polluting alternatives (e.g. potatoes, 
free range beef, chicken flocks).</li> 
<li>Coal burning for power and industry, and fossil fuel use generally will be 
greatly curtailed, thus solar, tide, hydroelectric, wave, wind, and biogas 
systems will come into general use. &quot;Clean&quot; fuels will be in global 
demand especially solar-electric vehicles. and wind-assisted freight systems 
{ships and balloons, or dirigibles).</li> 
<li>Community forestry will be of critical importance in bioregions, cities, 
and in arid or salted areas.</li> 
<li>Farm tenure could be tied to good husbandry, not &quot;yield&quot;, and 
disallowed if soil losses exceed soil creation on site, or water sources are 
polluted. Thus, annual cropping or plough culture will greatly decrease, and 
with it a host of problems.</li> 
<li>.Wise government will ban cattle, goats, and sheep from delicate arid or 
highland areas, and accept the high yields of adapted wildlife under careful 
mangement.</li> 
<li>.Any activity producing acid rain or persistent radioactives will be 
eliminated or minimised.</li> 
<li>There will need to be a global response to environmental refugees, 
especially from atolls, low coasts, stllaries, and coastal cities (due to sea 
level rises). These will need to be housed in new, well-designed, low-energy 
inland villages or self-reliant settlements, minimising transport and 
fossilfuel uses. Moreover, many of these strategies will need to start now, and 
many sensible people andregions are already moving in these&nbsp; directions. 
Books such as this one will be needed for planners and designers, and general 
media services (radio, television, educational services) will have a key role 
to play in avoiding chaos and directing a well-orchestrated series of changes 
via positive advice and documentary education. New approaches to total 
bioregional policy planning by coalitions of scientists, planners, 
conservationist, and cooperating essential industries can replace 
short-term,nationalistic political processes.</li> </ul> 
<p>Factors such as coastal seawater contamination of groundwaters, 
increase&nbsp; flood.damage, coastal<br>
 erosion, profound changes in 
fisheries and agriculture, and sociall disruption are foreseen as inevitable<br>
 for a century to come, but if all the causative factors continue unabated, 
worse and more rapid<br>
 changes can occur over the next 30 years. </p> 
<p>Essential industries {small steel, cement, pipe, glass. and workshop-based 
t enterrprises, plus energy industries&nbsp; will need to be relocated inland, 
and extensive road rerouting plus barge or water transport services will be 
needed; areas that will become islands will need efficient water or air 
transport.<br>
 As we cannot predict effects on fisheries or crops, diverse 
planning will be needed to establish inland<br>
 aquacultures, forests, and 
gardens; economic species should be collected and preserved for future<br>
 
changes.<br>
 Above all, people need now to be well-informed so that they can 
act for themselves, or in concert, and<br>
 we should all prepare for 
selfreliance and regional interdependence. As the problems are truly global,<br>
 global concerc and action will be needed.</p> 
<p>PAGE&nbsp; 557 </p> 
<p>I believe that only group or community (bioregional) survival&nbsp; 
meaningful and possible; individual survival is meaningless, as is survival in 
fortresses, Thus, we plan for total regions, and include all the skills of 
society.</p> 
<p>The profound change we must all make is internal; body needs to realise 
that there is no group<br>
 to their rescue, that it is only what each of us 
that counts; thus, those who cooperate with others, and take on a task relevant 
to all people, will be above those who seek personal survival.</p> <b></b> 
<p><b>14.15</b> <br>
<b>NO ASSISTANCE I.N AREAS OF NEED</b> </p> 
<p>In 1946, the ecologist Aldo Leopold (in A Sand Country Almanac, Oxford 
University Press) forsaw two seemingly inveitable trends; one is the exhausion 
of the wilderness as a resource, and &quot;the other is the world-wide 
hybridisation of cultures through modern transport and communication. the 
question arises whether certain values can be preserved that would otherwise be 
lost.&quot; Thus , in developing permaculture, we have the following factors in 
mind;<br>
 &nbsp; </p> 
<ul> 
<li>We need to cultivate or construct the resources that we use, not plunder a 
failing wilderness.</li> 
<li>All remaining genetic resources are to be preserved., as far as possible 
on their native sites (this includes cultivated plants)</li> 
<li>We need to accept that the hybridisation of culture does occur, but at the 
same time preserve the values in cultures that assist human happiness, 
responsibility, sharing, conservation, and good management. That is, need to 
put an ethical or value base to our actions.</li> 
<li>Many of us offer aid to areas of need, and there are numerous 
non-governnment organsiations (NGO's) at work in the area of aid; some are 
supported by churches, others by civil institutions, and many are groups of 
people organised locally; for self-help. Aid is necessary but delicate affair; 
some forms of aid can produce dependency, facilitate further inequities in a 
society, destroy or impair cultural values, decrease the yeiIds of the 
environment, upset delicately balanced nutritional habits, or actually destroy 
sustainable local ecologies or agricultural systems.</li> </ul> 
<p>Perhaps we can approach the matter of successful aid defining what such a 
success would entail; by<br>
 setting criteria for judging &quot;success&quot; 
.Thus, successful aid should:<br>
 &nbsp; </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Address real and basic problems of the region (nutrition, drought relief, 
land and resource inequality) and to recognise that political and financial 
action may necessary</li> 
<li>Devise strategies to offset the effects of such problems, and to educate a 
group of local people to apply trials of those strategies.</li> 
<li>&nbsp;Assess trials for side effects and sustainablility. </li> 
<li>Leave a local group able to further extend or educate others in such 
strategies.</li> 
<li>Provide modest support services and monitoring; above all, to record and 
circulate case&nbsp;&nbsp; histories to other non -governmen torganisations.
</li> </ul> 
<p>Problem areas are no place for fools, amateurs, or people who will not 
listen to others or assess<br>
 results. For example, many alkaline desert 
soils lack avilable zinc; whole grains and seed legumes<br>
 may exacerbate 
metabolic zinc loss. Thus, traditional diets need to be examined and supported 
if they provide sources of zinc from meats, bone, ashes, or animal testicles. 
Anew stove or cooker may prevent the incorporation of ashes in the diet, or a 
new diet 'may create a !!evere deficiency. There is no substitute for thorough 
analysis of soils and foods, the use of trace elements or soil additives, 
respect for traditional methods of food preparation, and an excellent education 
to accompany the project. Some of the factors that greatly assist effective aid 
are therefore:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Excellent research, and excellent teaching locally; local teachers to be 
encouraged for the long term.</li> 
<li>Courtesy and respect for traditional diets and methods, cultures and 
languages.</li> 
<li>Honest, modest, and practical (achievable, affordable) advice as to trials 
of new systems.</li> 
<li>Feedback assessed, and flexibility of approach maintained (no one 
solution).</li> 
<li>Congruence jn lifestyle and advice of advisers; advisers or educators 
should adopt their own advice! It is also important to teach models based on 
successful trials, not theoretical models.</li> 
<li>Effort to reach all sections of society. </li> 
<li>.A positive, cheerful, enthusiastic approach to projects, inspiring by 
example.</li> </ul> 
<p>The core of successful aid lies in modest trials, careful extension, and 
provision for widespread<br>
 education, so that after aid has ceased (or ended 
a phase) local people can continue the education process, maintain any system 
(financial, technological, or agricultural), andcan call for additional 
modest&nbsp; resources if necessary.</p> 
<p>Many problems are very long-term, and short-term aid (typical of emergency 
programmes) is not able to address these; drought has an 18-20 year 
periodicity, and needs to be coped with by food storages on good years, 
emergency food and forage from tree crop, pre-drought reduction of herds, 
widespread rainfall harve!!ting systems, and a well-informed public assisted by 
appropriate policy such as equable&nbsp; adjustment of livestock herd size, and 
government aid to establish drought refuges locally for essential livestock and 
for people.</p> 
<p>All these strategies need careful long-term planning, and tlrm policy 
implementation; these need to be in place over several decades before 
fine-tuning is possible. As political rule can change so rapidly, and is often 
repealed by opposing rulers, planning for the very long-term is possible only 
as a resident regional</p> 
<p>PAGE 558 </p> 
<p>involvement. &quot; Advisors&quot; are short-term, and if they do not leave 
a corps of well-informed people, are of I ephemeral effect; even such a basic 
technology as a water tap needs a trades-person capable of descaling vents and 
reseating valves, or replacing washers over the long term.</p> 
<p>In catastrophes, only residents are effective over the short term; it is 
they who need, and can effectively use, relief housing and supplies. Outside 
aid is far less effective except in the matter of supply of requested 
resources; in areas of India where drought was offset by storage of hardy crops 
such as ragi (a sorghum), the introduction of exotic wheat varieties has meant 
that ragi is often unavailable for storage. Eucalypt monoculture for rayon 
fibre (textiles) has obliterated many ragi fields, and in total this may add up 
to a deferred catastrophe. Aid-financed deep wells and pumps in the same region 
have enabled large livestock herds and more annual cropping at the cost of a 
rapidly falling water table. So &quot;improvements&quot; in short-term finances 
(to large landowners or industrialists) add up to a greatly impoverished 
population and environment; in short, desertification due to improvements&quot;.
</p> 
<p>Aid as Joint Enterprises <br>
 What is a joint enterprise? It is a mutual 
agreement,&nbsp; written and legal, that two groups, one third<br>
 world (TW) 
and one western world (WW), work out for a mutual ethical enterprise. 
Accounting is:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Financial: Most of the cash is from the WW group to establish a small 
manufacturing industry (seed production, craft, publishing, modest 
technological).The TW group supplies mainly skills and labour equivalents based 
on local average incomes. Jointly,costs are accounted up to product sale level, 
then net profits are equably split (profit minus costs and agreed-on cash 
reserves for future materials and expansion).</li> 
<li>Ethical: The product is life-enhancing and benefits&nbsp; people and the 
global ecology-</li> 
<li>Social: The product does not impoverish a local resource, or benefit an 
already rich group. The socialeffects are consistently.assessed and accounted.
</li> </ul> 
<p>Note: All forms of accounting are assessed annually,&nbsp; and the results 
circulated to all investors or<br>
 co-owners. </p> 
<p>It is probable that the WW group sets up sales, ads, investment in the 
first place, and acts for the enterprise in their country, thus generating 
capital. The TW group sells locally and supplies mainly labour and skills, but 
also teaches skills to the WW people. Both groups set aside 10-15% of nett 
profit as research and develop- ment funds, or fund socially needed health and 
educa- tion. Trade is always reciprocal.</p> 
<p>The long-term aim is to: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Satisfy needs of both groups in a specific area. </li> 
<li>Set up reciprocal beneficial trade and travel. </li> 
<li>Teach others how to do this. </li> 
<li>See that both ends of the arrangement have their essential need supplied 
</li> </ul> 
<p>Reduce the need for trade goods, and increase the information flow. </p> 
<p>The main aim is to make friends with each other; to draw closer together 
socially. This is the primary<br>
 written rule &quot;To become friends for 
mutual enrichment&quot;.</p> 
<p>For example, a dryland group in the WW sends a convener to a host group in 
the dryland TW, and<br>
 assesses local needs, both ways. A mutual decision is 
reached on an enterprise, e.g. seed growing.<br>
 Both grow and exchange seed, 
set up a single seed catalogue and packaging system, agree to split<br>
 
profits, make arrangements for reciprocal travel, and devise ways to be closer 
friends.</p> <b></b> 
<p><b>A FINAL LIMIT TO DEVELOPMENT.</b> <br>
 Few economic systems, including 
those outlined in this section, give thought to some ultimate end.<br>
 Even if 
we do achieve the goals of global community self-management, we are as much in 
danger of<br>
 destroying the world by producing goods endlessly in Mondragon 
cooperatives, communist, or<br>
 capitalist factories, or as individuals. There 
are certain rules for earth care which lie beyond the<br>
 economic realm. I 
believe we should always tend towards minimising the spread of people and their
<br> works on the face of the land. </p> 
<p>When we replace agriculture with gardens, then we should close down, as a 
priority, the most distant<br>
 or most damaging agricultures. We can retain as 
land stewards the very few broadscale graziers and<br>
 managers who now use 
vast tracts of land or who crop huge monocultural acreages. Better still, we<br>
 can make foresters of our farmers. Some of them are already on this path.</p> 
<p>If we close down farms and wasteproduct factories, we need to greatly 
enlarge true wilderness, for it is<br>
 the ultimate grace to give room on 
earth to all living things, and the ultimate in modesty .to regard ourselves 
as&nbsp; stewards, not gods. ,</p> <b></b>
