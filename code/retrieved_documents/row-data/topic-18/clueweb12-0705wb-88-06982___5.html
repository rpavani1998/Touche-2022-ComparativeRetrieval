<h2>Preparing a Charcoal Barbecue Grill</h2>  Posted in Barbecue <strong>|
</strong> No Comments &raquo; <br>

<p>Grilling on a charcoal barbecue grill can be fun and help you create many 
delicious meals. At the beginning of grilling season, or when you buy a new 
grill, there are a couple of things you need to do before cooking on it for the 
very first time.</p> 
<p>Most grills look clean and shiny when they are new, but can quickly turn 
disgusting after one or two uses. Before you use the grill, you will want to 
make sure it is clean of any leftover manufacturing oil or grime, which can 
negatively affect the taste of your food.</p>  This is a portion of Preparing a
