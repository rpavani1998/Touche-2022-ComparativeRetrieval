<h2> Bart Simpson,&nbsp;Anti-Hero </h2> Saturday, April 11, 2009 at 1:51PM <br>
 The Simpsons are the closest thing in America to a national media literacy 
program. By pretending to be a kids' cartoon, the show gets away with murder - 
that is, the virtual murder of our most coercive media iconography and 
techniques. For what began as an entertaining interstitial material for an 
alternative network variety show has revealed itself, in the 21st Century, as 
nothing short of a media revolution.<br>
<br>
Maybe that's the very reason the 
Simpsons worked so well. The Simpsons were born to provide the Tracey Ullman 
show with a way of cutting to commercial breaks. Their very function as a form 
of media was to bridge the discontinuity inherent to broadcast television. They 
existed to pave over the breaks. But rather than dampening the effects of these 
gaps in the broadcast stream, they heightened them. They acknowledged the 
jagged edges and recombinant forms behind the glossy patina of American 
television, and by doing so, initiated its deconstruction.<br>
<br>
Consider, 
for a moment, the way we thought of media before this cartoon family quite 
literally satirized us into consciousness. Media used to be a top-down affair. 
A few rich guys in suits sat in offices at the tops of tall buildings and 
decided which stories would be in the headlines or on the evening news, and how 
they would be told.<br>
<br>
As a result, we came to think of information as 
something that got fed to us from above. We counted on the editors of the New 
York Times to deliver &quot;all the news that's fit to print,&quot; and Walter 
Cronkite to tell us &quot;that's way it was.&quot; We had no reason not to 
trust the editorial decisions of the media managers upon whom we depended to 
present, accurately, what was going on in the world around us. In fact, most of 
us didn't even realize such decisions were being made at all. The TV became 
America's unquestioned window to the world, as the Simpson's opening sequence - 
which shows each family member rushing home to gather at the TV set - plainly 
acknowledges.<br>
<br>
But we call the stuff on television programming for a 
reason. No, television programmers are not programming television sets or 
evening schedules; they're programming the viewers. Whether they are convincing 
us to buy a product, vote for a candidate, adopt an ideology, or simply confirm 
a moral platitude, the underlying reason for making television is to hold onto 
our attention and then sell us a bill of goods. Since the time of the Bible and 
Aristotle through today's over-determined three-act action movies, the best 
tool at the programmer's disposal has been the story. But, thanks to 
interactive technologies like the remote control, and cynical attitudes like 
Bart Simpson's, the story just doesn't hold together anymore.<br>
<br>
For the 
most part, television stories program their audiences by bringing them into a 
state of tension. The author creates a character we like, and gets us to 
identify with the hero's plight. Then the character is put into jeopardy of one 
sort or another. As the character moves up the incline plane towards crisis, we 
follow him vicariously, while taking on his anxiety as our own. Helplessly we 
follow him into danger, disease, or divorce, and just when we can't take any 
more tension without bursting, our hero finds a way out. He finds a moral, a 
product, an agenda, or a strategy - the one preferred by the screenwriter or 
his sponsor, of course - that rescues him from and danger, and his audience 
from the awful vicarious anxiety. Then everyone lives happily ever after. This 
is what it means to &quot;enter-tain&quot; -- literally &quot;to hold 
within&quot; -- and it only works on a captive audience.<br>
<br>
In the old 
days of television, when character would get into danger, the viewer had little 
choice but to submit. To change the channel would have required getting up out 
of the La-Z-Boy chair, walking up to the television set, and turning the dial. 
50 calories of human effort. That's too much effort for a man of Homer's 
generation, anyway.<br>
<br>
The remote control changed all that. With an 
expenditure of, perhaps, .0001 calories, the anxious viewer is liberated from 
tortuous imprisonment and free to watch another program. Although most 
well-behaved adult viewers will soldier on through a story, kids raised with 
remotes in their hands have much less reverence for well-crafted story arcs, 
and zap away without a moment's hesitation. Instead of watching one program, 
they skim through ten at a time. They don't watch TV, they watch the 
television, guiding their own paths through the entirety of media rather than 
following the prescribed course of any one programmer.<br>
<br>
No matter how 
much we complain about our kids' short attention spans or even their Attention 
Deficit Disorder, their ability to disconnect from programming has released 
them from the hypnotic spell of even the best TV mesmerizers.<br>
<br>
The 
Nintendo joystick further empowers them while compounding the programmer's 
dilemma. In the old days, the TV image was unchangeable. Gospel truth piped 
into the home from the top of some glass building. Today, kids have the 
experience of manipulating the image on the screen. This has fundamentally 
altered their perception of and reverence for the television image. Just as the 
remote control allows viewers to deconstruct the television image, the joystick 
has demystified the pixel itself. The newsreader is just another middle-aged 
man manipulating his joystick. Hierarchy and authority are diminished, and the 
programmers' weapons neutralized.<br>
<br>
Sure, they might sit back and watch 
a program now and again -- but they do so voluntarily, and with full knowledge 
of their complicity. It is not an involuntary surrender.<br>
<br>
A person who 
is doing rather than receiving is much less easily provoked into a state of 
tension. The people I call &quot;screenagers,&quot; those raised with 
interactive devices in their media arsenals, are natives in a mediaspace where 
even the best television producers are immigrants. Like Bart, they speak the 
language better, and see through those clumsy attempts to program them into 
submission. They never forget for a moment that they are watching media, and 
resent those who try to draw them in and sell them something. They will not be 
part of a &quot;target market.&quot; At least not without a fight.<br>
<br>
So, 
then, what kind of television does appeal to such an audience? Programs that 
celebrate the screenager's irreverence for the image, while providing a new 
sort of narrative arc for the sponsor-wary audience. It's the ethos and 
behavior embodied by screenager role-model and anti-hero Bart Simpson.<br>
<br>

His name intended as an anagram for &quot;brat,&quot; Bart embodies youth 
culture's ironic distance from media and its willingness to dissemble and 
resplice even the most sacred meme constructs. From with the plastic safety of 
his incarnation as an animated character, Bart can do much more than just watch 
and comment on media iconography. Once a media figure has entered his animated 
world, Bart can interact with it, satirize it, or even become it. Although the 
Simpsons began on adult television, these animated tidbits became more popular 
than the live-action portion of the Tracy Ullman show and Fox Television 
decided to give the Simpson family their own series. It is not coincidental 
that what began as a bridging device between a show and its commercials--a 
media paste--developed into a self-similar media pastiche.<br>
<br>
&quot;The 
Simpsons'&quot; creator, comic-strip artist Matt Groening (rhymes with 
&quot;raining&quot;), has long understood the way to mask his countercultural 
agenda. &quot;I find you can get away with all sorts of unusual ideas if you 
present them with a smile on your face,&quot; he said in an early 1990's 
interview. In fact the show's mischievous ten-year-old protagonist is really 
just the screen presence of Groening's true inner nature. For his self-portrait 
in a Spin magazine article, Groening simply drew a picture of Bart and then 
scribbled the likeness of his own glasses and beard over it. Bart functions as 
Matt Groening's &quot;smile,&quot; and the child permits him--and the show's 
young, Harvard-educated writing staff--to get away with a hell of a lot. 
&quot;The Simpsons&quot; takes place in a town called Springfield, named after 
the fictional location of &quot;Father Knows Best,&quot; making it clear that 
the Simpson family is meant as a nineties answer to the media reality presented 
to us in the fifties and sixties. This is the American media family turned on 
its head, told from the point of view of not the smartest member of the family, 
but the most ironic. Audiences delight in watching Bart effortlessly outwit his 
parents, teachers, and local institutions. This show is so irreverent that it 
provoked an attack from George Bush, who pleaded for the American family to be 
more like the Waltons than the Simpsons. The show's writers quickly responded, 
letting Bart say during one episode, &quot;Hey, man, we're just like the 
Waltons. Both families are praying for an end to the depression.&quot; The show 
shares many of the viral features of other nineties programs. Murphy Brown's 
office dartboard, for example, was used as a meme slot; in each episode it has 
a different satirical note pinned to it. The &quot;Simpsons'&quot; writers also 
create little slots for the most attentive viewers to glean extra memes. The 
opening credits always begin with Bart writing a different message on his 
classroom bulletin board and contain a different saxophone solo from his 
sister, Lisa. Every episode has at least one film reenactment, usually from 
Hitchcock or Kubrick, to satirize an aspect of the modern cultural experience. 
In a spoof of modern American child care, writers re-created a scene from The 
Birds, except here, Homer Simpson rescued his baby daughter from a daycare 
center by passing through a playground of menacingly perched babies.<br>
<br>

These media references form the basis for the show's role as a media literacy 
primer. The joy of traditional television storytelling is simply getting to the 
ending. The reward is making it through to the character's escape from danger. 
While most episodes of the Simpsons incorporate a dramatic nod to such 
storytelling convention, the screenagers watching the program couldn't care 
less about whether Principle Skinner gets married, or if Homer finds his donut. 
These story arcs are there for the adult viewers only. No, the pleasure of 
watching the Simpsons for its media-literate (read: younger) viewers is the joy 
of pattern recognition. The show provides a succession of &quot;aha&quot; 
moments - those moments when we recognize which other forms of media are being 
parodied. We are rewarded with self-congratulatory laughter whenever we make a 
connection between the scene we are watching and the movie, commercial, or 
program on which it is based.<br>
<br>
In this sense, The Simpsons deconstructs 
and informs the media soup of which it is a part. Rather than drawing us into 
the hypnotic spell of the traditional storyteller, the program invites us to 
make active and conscious comparisons of its own scenes with those of other, 
less transparent, media forms. By doing so, the show's writers help us in our 
efforts to develop immunity to their coercive effects.<br>
<br>
The show's 
supervisors through The Simpsons' golden years of the mid-1990's, Mike Reiss 
and Al Jean, were both Harvard Lampoon veterans. When I met with them on the 
Fox lot, they told me how they delighted in animation's ability to serve as a 
platform for sophisticated social and media satire. &quot;About two thirds of 
the writers have been Harvard graduates,&quot; explained Jean, &quot;so it's 
one of the most literate shows in TV.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We take subjects on 
the show,&quot; added Reiss, who was Jean's classmate, &quot;that we can 
parody. Homer goes to college or onto a game show. We'll take Super Bowl 
Sunday, and the parody the Bud Bowl, and how merchants capitalize on the 
event.&quot; Having been raised on media themselves, the Diet Coke-drinking, 
baseball-jacketed pair gravitated toward parodying the media aspects of the 
subjects they pick. They did not comment on social issues as much as they did 
the media imagery around a particular social issue.<br>
<br>
&quot;These days 
television in general seems to be feeding on itself. Parodying itself,&quot; 
Jean told me. &quot;Some of the most creative stuff we write comes from just 
having the Simpsons watch TV.&quot; Which they did often. Many episodes are 
still about what happens on the Simpsons' own TV set, allowing the characters 
to feed off television, which itself is feeding off other television. In this 
self-reflexive circus, it is only Bart who refuses to be fooled by anything. 
His father, Homer, represents an earlier generation and can easily be 
manipulated by TV commercials and publicity stunts like clear beer. &quot;Homer 
certainly falls for every trick,&quot; admitted Reiss, &quot;even believing the 
Publishers Clearing House mailing that he is a winner.&quot; When Homer 
acquired an illegal cable TV hookup, he became so addicted to the tube that he 
almost died. Lisa, the brilliant member of the family, maintains a faith in the 
social institutions of her world, works hard to get good grades in school, and 
even entered and won a Reader's Digest essay contest about patriotism.<br>
<br>

&quot;But Lisa feels completely alienated by the media around her,&quot; Jean 
warned me. &quot;The writers empathize with her more than any other character. 
She has a more intellectual reaction to how disquieting her life has become. 
When Homer believes he may die from a heart attack, he tells the children, 'I 
have some terrible news.' Lisa answers, 'Oh, we can take anything. We're the 
MTV generation. We feel neither highs nor lows.' Homer asks what it's like, and 
she just goes 'Eh.' It was right out there.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bart's reaction to 
his cultural alienation, on the other hand, is much more of a lesson in GenX 
strategy. Bart is a ten-year-old media strategist - or at least an unconscious 
media manipulator - and his exploits reveal the complexity of the current pop 
media from the inside out. In one episode - the show that earned Reiss and Jean 
their first Emmy nomination - Homer sees a commercial for a product he feels 
will make a great birthday gift for Bart: a microphone that can be used to 
broadcast to a special radio from many feet away (a parody of a toy called Mr. 
Microphone). At first Bart is bored with the gift and plays with a labeler he 
also received instead. Bart has fun renaming things and leaving messages like 
&quot;property of Bart Simpson&quot; on every object in his home; one such 
label on a beer in the fridge convinces Homer that the can is off limits. 
Bart's joy, clearly, is media . . . and subversive disinformation.<br>
<br>

Homer plays with the radio instead, trying to get Bart's interest, but the boy 
knows the toy does not really send messages into the mediaspace; it only 
broadcasts to one little radio. Bart finally takes interest in the toy when he 
realizes its subversive value. After playing several smaller-scale pranks, he 
accidentally drops the radio down a well and gets the idea for his master plan. 
Co-opting a media event out of real history, when a little girl struggled for 
life at the bottom of a well as rescuers worked to save her and the world 
listened via radio, Bart uses his toy radio to fool the world and launch his 
own media virus.<br>
<br>
He creates a little boy named Timmy O'Toole, who 
cries for help from the bottom of the well. When police and rescuers prove too 
fat to get into the well to rescue the boy, a tremendous media event develops. 
News teams set up camp around the well, much in the fashion they gather around 
any real-world media event like the OJ Trial or Waco stand-off. They conduct 
interviews with the unseen Timmy--an opportunity Bart exploits to make 
political progress against his mean school principal. In Timmy's voice he tells 
reporters the story of how he came to fall into the well: He is an orphan, new 
to the neighborhood, and was rejected for admission to the local school by the 
principal because his clothes were too shabby. The next day, front-page stories 
calling for the principal's dismissal appear. Eventually the virus grows to the 
point where real-world pop musician, Sting, and Krusty the Clown, a TV 
personality from within the world of &quot;The Simpsons,&quot; record an aid 
song and video to raise money for the Timmy O'Toole cause called &quot;We're 
Sending Our Love Down the Well.&quot; The song hits number one on the charts.
<br> <br>
So Bart, by unconsciously exploiting a do-it-yourself media toy to 
launch viruses, feeds back to mainstream culture. He does this both as a 
character in Springfield, USA, and as a media icon in our datasphere, 
satirizing the real Sting's charity recordings. The character Bart gets revenge 
against his principal and enjoys a terrific prank. The icon Bart conducts a 
lesson in advanced media activism. But, most importantly, it is through Bart 
that the writers of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; are enabled to voice their own, 
more self-conscious comments on the media.<br>
<br>
Finally, in the story, Bart 
remembers that he has put a label on his radio toy, earmarking it 
&quot;property of Bart Simpson.&quot; He decides he better get it out of the 
well before the radio, and his own identity, is discovered. In his attempt to 
get the damning evidence out from the bottom of the well, however, Bart really 
does fall in. He calls for help, admitting what he has done. But once there is 
a real child in the well - and one who had attempted to play a prank on the 
media - everyone loses interest in the tragedy. The virus is blown. The Sting 
song plummets on the charts, and the TV news crews pack up and leave. It is 
left to Bart's mom and dad to dig him out by hand. In our current self-fed 
media, according to the writers of &quot;The Simpsons,&quot; a real event can 
have much less impact than a constructed virus, especially when its intention 
is revealed.<br>
<br>
No matter how activist the show appears, its creators 
insist that they have no particular agenda. Reiss, insisted he promoted no 
point of view on any issue. In fact he claimed to have picked the show's 
subjects and targets almost randomly: &quot;The show eats up so much material 
that we're constantly just stoking it like a furnace when we parody a lot of 
movies and TV. And now so many of our writers are themselves the children of TV 
writers. There's already a second generation rolling in of people who not only 
watched TV but watched tons of it. And this is our mass culture. Where everyone 
used to know the catechism, now they all know episodes of 'The Twilight Zone,' 
our common frame of reference.&quot;<br>
<br>
Reiss was being deceptively 
casual. Even if he and the other writers claim to have no particular agenda - 
which is debatable - they readily admit to serving the media machine as a 
whole. As writers, they see themselves as &quot;feeding&quot; the show and 
using other media references as the fodder. It is as if the show is a living 
thing, consuming media culture, recombining it, and spitting it out as 
second-generation media. With a spin.<br>
<br>
Even Bart is in on the gag. In 
one episode, when Homer is in the hospital, the family stands around his sick 
bed recalling incidents from the past, leading to a satire of the flashback 
format used by shows to create a new episode out of &quot;greatest hit&quot; 
scenes from old ones. As the family reminisces together about past events, Bart 
raises a seeming non sequitur. His mother, Marge, asks him, &quot;Why did you 
bring that up?&quot; &quot;It was an amusing episode,&quot; replies Bart, half 
looking at the camera, before he quickly adds &quot;. . . of our . . . 
lives.&quot; Bart knows he's on a TV show and knows the kinds of tricks his own 
writers use to fill up airtime.<br>
<br>
Such self-consciousness is what allows 
&quot;The Simpsons&quot; to serve as a lesson in modern media discontinuity. 
Bart skateboards through each episode, demonstrating the necessary ironic 
detachment needed to move through increasingly disorienting edits. &quot;It's 
animation,&quot; explained Jean, who has since returned to writing for the 
program. &quot;It's very segmented, so we just lift things in and out. If you 
watch an old episode of 'I Love Lucy,' you'll find it laborious because they 
take so long to set something up. The thesis of the Simpsons' is nihilism. 
There's nothing to believe in anymore once you assume that organized structures 
and institutions are out to get you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Right,&quot; chimed 
in Reiss, finally admitting to an agenda. &quot;The overarching point is that 
the media's stupid and manipulative, TV is a narcotic, and all big institutions 
are corrupt and evil.&quot; These writers make their points both in the plots 
of the particular episodes and in the cut-and-paste style of the show. By 
deconstructing and reframing the images in our media, they allow us to see them 
more objectively, or at least with more ironic distance. They encourage us to 
question the ways institutional forces are presented to us through the media 
and urge us to see the fickle nature of our own responses. Figures from the 
television world are represented as cartoon characters not just to accentuate 
certain features, but to allow for total recontextualization of their 
identities. These are not simple caricatures, but pop cultural samples, 
juxtaposed in order to illuminate the way they effect us.<br>
<br>
As writers 
and producers, Reiss and Jean served almost as &quot;channels&quot; for the 
media, as received through their own attitudinal filters. While they experience 
their function as simply to &quot;stoke the furnace,&quot; the media images 
they choose to dissemble are the ones they feel need to be exposed and 
criticized.<br>
<br>
Reiss admitted to me, ''I feel that in this way 'The 
Simpsons' is the ultimate of what you call a media virus. It sounds a little 
insidious because I have kids of my own, and the reason we're a hit is because 
so many kids watch us and make us a huge enterprise. But we're feeding them a 
lot of ideas and notions that they didn't sign on for. That's not what they're 
watching for. We all come from this background of comedy that has never been 
big and popular--it's this Letterman school or 'Saturday Night Live,' Harvard 
Lampoon, National Lampoon. We used to be there, too.&quot;<br>
<br>
The 
Simpsons provided its writers with a durable viral shell for their most 
irreverent memes: &quot;It's as though we finally found a vehicle for this 
sensibility, where we can do the kind of humor and the attitudes, yet in a 
package that more people are willing to embrace. I think if it were a 
live-action show, it wouldn't be a hit,&quot; Reiss concluded quite accurately.
<br> <br>
In the mainstream media, only kids' TV appears sufficiently innocuous 
to permit such high levels of irreverence. Like a Trojan Horse, the Simpsons 
sneaks into our homes looking like one thing, before releasing something else, 
far different, into our lives. The audience interested in the program's 
subversive doctrine may not be large enough to keep the show in prime time, but 
the millions of kids who tune in every week to watch Bart's antics are.<br>
<br>
If the Simpsons fades in popularity in the coming decade, it will merely be a 
testament to the show having accomplished its purpose. Once we fully recognize 
the way that our media attempts to make us care about things we ought best not 
care about - from the label on our sneakers to the hair style of our 
politicians - Bart's lesson in media literacy and activism will be complete.
