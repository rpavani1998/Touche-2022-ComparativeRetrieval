<h2>  13 Reasons the New Nikon SB-910 Speedlight Flash Is Worth the Money </h2>
1. Nikon introduced its new SB-910 Speedlight Flash at the end of November 
2011, replacing the SB-900, as the top unit in Nikon&rsquo;s Creative Lighting 
System (CLS).
<p>2. Professional photographers will certainly gravitate to the SB-910 with 
its top-of-the-line features and performance; however, Nikon has designed it 
for any photographer that requires portability and big power for a wide range 
of shooting situations.</p> 
<p>3. Enthusiasts, professionals and industry experts are already applauding 
the SB-910&rsquo;s more intuitive graphic user interface that is reminiscent of 
the GUI on Nikon&rsquo;s older SB-700 Speedlight. Lighted function buttons, a 
separate menu button and an upgraded LCD screen make operation of the SB-910 
more efficient.<br>
<br>
4. Instead of the overheating protection system found 
on many other flash units, which completely stops the operation of the flash, 
Nikon&rsquo;s Thermal Cut-Out system in the new SB-910 simply hesitates the 
recycling time until the temperature decreases to its default level to continue 
shooting.<br>

<p>5. The SB-910 also comes with color compensation filters for fluorescent 
and incandescent color temperature balancing. They are tough and solid, 
extending the unit&rsquo;s life and giving it more protection from heat. The 
flash detects which filter has been selected and adjusts the white balance 
setting on the Nikon DSLR camera to which it is attached.</p> 
<p>6. Photographers will also appreciate that the SB-910&rsquo;s AF-assist 
illuminator works with all the AF systems found in Nikon DSLRs.</p> 
<p>7. Making the Nikon SB-910 Speedlight even more versatile and easy to use 
is its three lighting configurations: standard, center-weighted and even. Each 
was designed to assist the photographers for virtually all shooting scenarios. 
As its name implies, the standard configuration produces a flash for many 
typical photos. Portrait photographers will discover that the center-weighted 
configuration seemed to be designed just for them. They&rsquo;ll have the use 
of larger guide numbers at comparable focal lengths than many other flash 
units. The even configuration is a great aid for group photos, as the light 
will illuminate the entire group with no falloff at the edges.</p> 
<p>8. Nikon gave the SB-910 other &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; features, 
including a multi-step power zoom range with an expansive 17&ndash;200mm angle 
of view, so the right amount of light is generated according to the lens in 
use. It also &ldquo;knows&rdquo; whether the photographer is using a Nikon FX 
or DX format, and then makes the proper zoom adjustments for the light required.
</p> 
<p>9. To take its position at the top of Nikon&rsquo;s Speedlight line, the 
SB-910 also supports the company&rsquo;s sophisticated wireless TTL technology. 
The SB-910 serves as a wireless commander that directs three different groups 
of speedlights. It also works as a remote speedlight when controlled from other 
SB-910s, SB-700s, Nikon&rsquo;s SU-800 Wireless Commander or the built-in 
speedlight set to Commander Mode on compatible Nikon DSLR cameras.</p> 
<p>10. The SB-910 has the speed to benefit any photographer who wants 
professional-grade lighting. Recycling time is approximately 2.5 seconds for 
full power with NiMH batteries, and approximately 3.0 seconds with AA Alkaline 
batteries.</p> 
<p>11. Inclement weather won&rsquo;t deter the use of the SB-910 outdoors, 
since Nikon is adding optional water guards to some of its cameras, which will 
keep moisture from the flash-to-camera connection.</p> 
<p>12. The Nikon SB-910 Speedlight Kit also includes the SJ-4 Color Filter 
set, with Warming, Red, Yellow and Blue filters, and the AS-21 Speedlight 
Stand, SW-13H Diffusion Dome and SS-910 soft case.</p> 
<p>13. B&amp;H Photo Video expects to receive the first SB-910s before January 
1, 2012, which can be pre-ordered at the price of $549.95.</p>
