<p><b>RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:</b></p> 
<p>A. &nbsp;To explore husbands' and other male influentials' motivations and 
barriers to being involved in: birth preparedness, promoting skilled 
attendance, using skilled care.</p> 
<p>B. &nbsp;To determine factors that underlie household and community level 
delays in seeking skilled care for normal births and in obstetric emergencies, 
particularly their own role but also the specific role of other household and 
community influentials.</p> 
<p>C. To elicit husband/male influential perspective on preparation women and 
families now make for birth, particularly their current role in 
preparations/support and potential roles; feasibility and acceptability of 
birth preparedness; and to understand motivations of men to participate in 
preparing for the birth and ensuring skilled attendance at delivery.</p> 
<p>D. To explore husband/male influential support and perceived consequences 
of TBA compared to care by a skilled attendant during and after delivery, and 
their perspective on the preferences of women now for birth attendant and birth 
location, and reasons why women do or do not use skilled care (barriers, 
motivators, willingness to change).</p> 
<p>E. &nbsp;To explore husbands/male influentials&rsquo; knowledge and 
perceptions of problems, complications, and emergencies in birth and early 
postpartum, when and where they should be cared for, and perceptions of 
emergency care providers.</p>

<p></p> 
<p><b>S</b><b>a</b><b>y</b><b>: &nbsp;</b>This is part of a study to learn 
more about how we can help women be healthier in pregnancy and childbirth. I 
want to ask you questions about what men in your community think about this 
issue, because we know that men are important in the family.</p> 
<p><b>B</b><b>I</b><b>R</b><b>TH PREPAREDNESS</b></p> 
<p><b>Notes for the Interviewer</b></p>

<p>What types of routine preparations are made for childbirth? Who helps in 
planning and making preparations for birth?</p> 
<p>Who is the decision-maker &nbsp;for delivery location and preparations for 
birth?</p> 
<p><b>S</b><b>a</b><b>y</b><b>: </b>I&rsquo;d like to ask you about how women 
and their families prepare for childbirth.</p> 
<p><b><i>Qu</i></b><b><i>e</i></b><b><i>s</i></b><b><i>tions to ask:</i></b>
</p> 
<p><b>1</b><b>. &nbsp;When a woman is pregnant, are men involved in any 
discussion about where she&rsquo;s going to delivery the baby?</b></p> 
<p><i>I</i><i>f yes: </i>Who&rsquo;s involved in the conversation? W ho 
initiates it? What is said? What are all the places for delivery women and 
their families consider?</p> 
<p><i>I</i><i>f no: </i>Why not? Should they have this kind of discussion? 
Why/ why not? Who should initiate a conversation on this topic?</p> 
<p><b>2</b><b>. &nbsp;During a woman&rsquo;s pregancy, does her husband do 
anything to prepare for childbirth?</b></p> 
<p><i>I</i><i>f yes: </i>What? Arrange transport? Set aside money? Other? How 
are each of these arrangements made? When are these arrangements made? Who else 
is involved?</p> 
<p><i>I</i><i>f not: </i>Why not? Do you think that men should be involved in 
these kinds of preparations? Why/</p> 
<p>why not?</p> 
<p><b>3</b><b>. &nbsp;If a pregnant woman and her family have different ideas 
about where she should deliver or which preparations should be made, whose 
opinion in the family is the final decision?</b></p> 
<p>How much influence does the woman herself have over where she&rsquo;s going

<p><b>Notes for the Interviewer</b></p> 
<p>Key ideas to explore:</p> 
<p>Where do women prefer to deliver?</p> 
<p>What are barriers to delivering in health facilities?</p> 
<p><b>S</b><b>a</b><b>y</b><b>: </b>As you know women deliver their babies at 
different places &ndash; at their own homes, TBAs homes, and health facilities. 
I&rsquo;d like to ask you some questions now about why this is.</p> 
<p><b><i>Qu</i></b><b><i>e</i></b><b><i>s</i></b><b><i>tions to ask:</i></b>
</p> 
<p><b>4</b><b>. &nbsp;Why do you think women sometimes deliver their babies at 
home?</b></p> 
<p>What do they like about delivering there? What do family members do to help?
</p> 
<p><b>5</b><b>. &nbsp;What do TBAs do to help women during delivery?</b></p> 
<p>Where do they usually assist deliveries &ndash; at their own homes or at 
women&rsquo;s homes? What are the best parts about delivering with a TBA? What 
do women not like about delivering with a TBA? Why do you think some women 
deliver with TBAs and others deliver by themselves or with family members?</p> 
<p><b>6</b><b>. &nbsp;What do staff at health facilities do to help women 
during delivery?</b></p> 
<p>How do they help a woman feel more comfortable? How do they treat the 
people who come with the woman to the health facility, like her family members 
or a TBA? Do they ask women and their families to purchase any items or pay any 
fees? What? How much does it cost? What happens if women and their families 
can&rsquo;t pay these fees? W hy do you think some women deliver at health 
facilities and others deliver their babies at home and/or with TBAs?</p> 
<p><b>7</b><b>. &nbsp;Around here, are men ever away when their wives go into 
labor?</b></p> 
<p><i>I</i><i>f yes: </i>Where are they usually (<i>probe for migrant work, 
etc.</i>)? What happens it&rsquo;s time for a woman to deliver her baby but her 
husband&rsquo;s not available? If the woman wants to go a health facility, can 
she go even his without permission?</p>

<p><b>S</b><b>KI</b><b>LLED CARE FOR OBSTETRIC EMERGENCIES</b></p> 
<p><b>Notes for the Interviewer</b></p> 
<p>Key ideas to explore:</p> 
<p>What do men know about obstetric complications?</p> 
<p>How do men feel about planning for obstetric emergencies?</p> 
<p><b>S</b><b>a</b><b>y</b><b>: </b>Some women experience complications in 
late pregnancy, childbirth and the first weeks after delivery. It would be 
helpful to hear more about these problems.</p>

</b></p> 
<p>Complications during late pregnancy? During childbirth? During the first 
few weeks after childbirth?</p> 
<p><b>9</b><b>. &nbsp;Out of all these problems, which do you think are the

problem? What? Why?</p> 
<p>b)&nbsp; &nbsp;Where can they go to get help in your community?</p> 
<p>c)&nbsp; &nbsp;Which health facilities can they go to?</p> 
<p>d)&nbsp; &nbsp;What kinds of arrangements do they make if they decide to go 
to a health facility?</p> 
<p>e)&nbsp; &nbsp;What kind of transportation can they take to get to a health 
facility?</p> 
<p>f) &nbsp;&nbsp; What do you think can happen once they get to a health 
facility?</p> 
<p><b>1</b><b>1</b><b>.</b><b> </b><b>Do women and their families ever make 
plans in advance in case problems like these occur?</b></p> 
<p><i>I</i><i>f yes: </i>What do they do? Why? Who is involved in discussing 
and making these arrangements? How are men, specifically, involved? Are there 
other plans that you think they should make in advance? What would make it 
easier for women and their families to make these kinds of plans?</p> 
<p><i>I</i><i>f no: </i>Why not? Do you think that they should have this kind 
of discussion? Why/ why not? How easy or difficult would it be to make these 
kinds of plans?</p>

<p><b>Notes for the Interviewer</b></p> 
<p>Key ideas to explore:</p> 
<p>What are customary practices during the first two weeks after childbirth? 
How do men view early postpartum care on a routine basis?</p> 
<p><b>S</b><b>a</b><b>y</b><b>: </b>We talked about preparing for delivery, 
and about giving birth. Now I would just like to ask you a few more questions 
about the time right after childbirth.</p>

she first leave her house?</b></p> 
<p>Can women leave the house whenever they want after childbirth? Why? Are 
there exceptions?</p> 
<p><b>1</b><b>3</b><b>.</b><b> </b><b>Do you think that women should go to a 
health facility after they deliver to get a check-up for themselves?</b></p> 
<p>Why/ why not? &nbsp;If a woman has a normal delivery and a healthy baby and 
feels well, should she go for a check-up for herself? W hy or why not? How soon 
after the birth should she go? Who should go with her? If she doesn&rsquo;t go 
to a health facility, should she go to a TBA? Why/ why not?</p>

<p><b>Notes for the Interviewer</b></p> 
<p>Key ideas to explore:</p> 
<p>How do pregnant women get information and support from their household and 
community? What are potential outlets for health-related messages, including 
radio?</p> 
<p><b>S</b><b>a</b><b>y</b><b>: </b>I&rsquo;m also interested to hear how 
women around here learn about childbirth.</p>

<p>The work of children is play. Play is the main means through which they 
learn ideologies, worldviews, behaviors, knowledge and skills to negotiate 
their place in their world. However, play with their peer group, with older 
children and with adults is highly value laden and gendered in its 
socialization, psychosocial growth and wellbeing effects on young children.</p>

<h3><strong><strong>Being </strong></strong>dad</h3> 
<ul> 
<li> Making the most of visits with the kids <br>

<p><strong>Many divorced fathers are faced with the reality of visitation- an 
often negotiated, mediated and all too brief time they are able to spend with 
their children.</strong> In many cases, visitation is very limited, compared to 
the relationship dads used to be able to enjoy, so it's absolutely crucial that 
dads make this visitation time the best possible experience for their children 
and themselves. Here are a few ideas for making the most of your visitation:</p>

<li> Listen to her - and then listen some more <br>

<p><strong>Girls tend to be a riddle to fathers.</strong> Like any mystery, 
the relationship with our daughter can be frightening, exciting, entertaining, 
baffling, enlightening or leave us completely in the dark; sometimes all at 
once...</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Dealing with miscarriage <br>

<p><strong>Miscarriages happen for a wide variety of reasons.</strong> About 
half are due to abnormalities in the fetus or the placenta, including 
chromosomal problems. Sometimes the egg attaches in the wrong place resulting 
in an early miscarriage. Recent studies have linked environmental pollution or 
excessive caffeine consumption to higher risks of miscarriage. So the short 
answer is that most times, miscarriage occurs totally outside of the control of 
the expectant mother. But both physically and emotionally, miscarriage means 
much more than the textbook definition. There are strong physical and emotional 
impacts to a couple who experience miscarriage.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Healing family conflicts <br>

<p><strong>Families can be torn apart by illness, divorce or other problems 
that create conflict and stress.</strong> Family therapy can help families 
identify and resolve problems. Your family can be your greatest source of 
support, comfort and love. But it can also be your greatest source of pain and 
grief. A health crisis, mental illness, work problems or teenage rebellion may 
threaten to tear your family apart. Family therapy can help your family weather 
such storms. Family therapy can help patch strained relationships, teach new 
coping skills and improve how your family works together. Whether it's you, 
your partner, a child or even a sibling or parent who's in crisis, family 
therapy can help all of you communicate better and learn to get along.</p> Read

<p><strong>As a proud new dad, you want to do everything you can to be 
involved in your child's life.</strong> But during those bleary early weeks, 
when your baby is breastfeeding around the clock, it can be hard to work out 
where to start.Hang on in there. With time, you and your baby will develop your 
own special relationship - one that's just as vital as the mother-baby bond. 
Meanwhile, here are our top tips for being the best possible dad from the word 
go:</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> How to adjust to life as a single father <br>

<p><strong>Is there a more challenging transition for a man than to become a 
new single dad with children at home?</strong> <br>
If there is, I can't 
imagine it. Whether you lose your spouse and the mother of your kids to death 
or because of a divorce and/or abandonment or your partner working away fro 
long periods at a time, adjusting to the new reality of things is a major and 
life changing task.I look after my two daughters, aged five and four, in 
Harare, Zimbabwe - a very challenging environment. There are many times I just 
don't enjoy it - it is a real hard job but this is more than compensated for in 
the love I receive from my daughters, the praise from their Mum who is working 
away about the job I am doing and the hugs, kisses and other feedback I get 
from my girls.</p> Read more... </li>

<p>It is much easier to become a father than to be one. ~Kent Nerburn</p> 
<p>When I was a boy of fourteen, my father was so ignorant I could hardly 
stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be twenty-one, I was 
astonished at how much he had learned in seven years. ~Mark Twain</p>

<li> Single, separated and divorced fathers <br>

<p><strong>A peaceful divorce? Possibly. A pain-free divorce? That&rsquo;s 
exceedingly rare.</strong> The adjustments for dad, mum and kids are major.

<li> Myths surrounding children and divorce <br>

<p><strong>In the early 1970&rsquo;s, Judith Wallerstein, began to study the 
effects ofdivorce on children.</strong> She studied a group of 131 children and 
their families who were going through the divorce process over a period of 25 
years. In her book, The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce: A 25 Year Landmark Study, 
published in 2000, we learn that children really aren&rsquo;t 
&ldquo;resilient&rdquo; and that divorce leaves children to struggle for a 
life-time with the residue of a decision their parents made.</p> Read more...

just a part of growing up.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Blended families <br>

<p><strong>Stepfamilies, also known as blended families, are more of a norm 
now than ever.</strong> At least one-third of all children will be part of a 
stepfamily before they reach age 18. Children in blended families may at first 
resist the many changes they face. Fortunately, most blended families are able 
to work out their growing pains and live together successfully. Open 
communication, positive attitudes, mutual respect and plenty of love and 
patience all have an important place in creating a healthy blended family.</p>

<p><strong>Parental smoking is a significant issue.</strong> In a study of

mother). Tobacco consumption was higher where both parents smoked or where only 
the father smoked</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Dads and breastfeeding <br>

<p><strong>Breast is best!!!</strong> Before the baby is born, you may find 
that many expectant fathers state categorically that breast is best, and that 
they are fully in favour of their partner breastfeeding for as long as possible.

<li> Dads hold up half the sky <br>

<p><strong>Fathers parent differently from mothers and that difference matters 
a lot for kids!</strong> Fatherhood is just as essential to healthy child 
development as motherhood! In some measures, father-love is more important. The 
professional journal, Review of General Psychology, finds &ldquo;evidence 
suggests that the influence of father love on offspring&rsquo;s development is 
as great as and occasionally greater than the influence of mother love.&rdquo;

<li> Tell your kids you love them! <br>

<p><strong>Men are often tongue tied when asked to make their feelings open 
but &quot;I love you,&quot; are three words all children need to hear often 
from their Dad.</strong><br>
Do you want those words to have real meaning to 
your child? Do you want them to connect one heart to another? Do you want to 
use them to develop a level of intimacy between you that communicates your 
heartfelt affection for your children? If so, consider strengthening 'I love 
you' with the following suggestions.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Common fertility problems for men <br>

<p><strong>Blockages.</strong> A small percentage of men have a blockage in 
their ejaculatory duct that prevents sperm from getting into their ejaculate 
fluid. If your vas deferens or epididymis tubes are blocked or damaged, they 
can prevent your sperm from getting to your partner's egg. Infection, injury, 
congenital defects, or avasectomy could cause this blockage.</p> Read more...

<li> What dads-to-be dream about <br>

<p>Could being a dad-to-be explain why I'm having such strange dreams? As a 
dad-to-be, your feelings of excitement, anticipation, anxiety, and worry may 
open a floodgate of dreams. Perhaps you've been dreaming about sleeping with 
someone besides your partner? This could mean that you're worried that 
pregnancy will damage your sex life. Or maybe you've been dreaming about your 
grandparents? Pending fatherhood can make you think about your family's roots. 
Your dreams might also reveal that you are feeling resentful and left out as 
all the attention centres around your partner and her growing bump. </p> Read

<li> Married fathers <br>

<p><strong>Is it impossible for a father to be a good one if he is not married 
to the mother of his child?</strong> No. But it is certainly much harder, and 
it is more difficult for a father to leave the kind of legacy for his children 
that he needs to. Keeping your marriage strong takes time and investment but 
the rewards are great.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Registering baby's birth <br>

<p><strong>It's my child - and I'm proud to be his Dad!!!</strong> The 
registration of births varies in different countries but a good starting point 
for information is your midwife, hospital or delivery unit. They can guide you 
where to go. Usually the baby must be registered within 42 days (six weeks) of 
the date of birth. Do it!</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Managing your anger <br>

<p><strong>Ever felt that your anger was getting the best of you?</strong> As 
we discipline children, anger is an emotion that must be controlled. After all, 
we are trying to change behaviour and teach self control--we can't lose ours in 
the process. Find ways to keep anger under control as you work with your 
children.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Five worries about fathering our daughters <br>

<p><strong>Every father faces psychological and cultural barriers on the way 
to full engagement in a daughter&rsquo;s life...</strong> We must understand 
these hurdles to be effective fathers and stepfathers&mdash;or to work 
effectively with fathers and families. These hurdles may seem silly, 
unnecessary, or insignificant to others. But they are not silly, unnecessary, 
or insignificant to fathers.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Dad's at a distance - working away <br>

<p><strong>Relationships with children are much like plants, they need 
constant nourishing!</strong> At home, this type of nourishment comes easily 
through the activities and time spent with your children. However, when you are 
away this becomes more difficult to accomplish. If work takes you away from 
your child more often than you would like, these fun ideas will help you and 
her to have some special times, even though you're miles apart.</p> Read more...

<p><strong>Whether you are divorced or separated and the custodial parent, or 
whether you are a widowed dad, the challenges are similar...</strong> So, given 
the advice from those who have walked in your shoes, here are some suggestions 
for tackling this important task successfully.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> 5 myths of fatherhood <br>

<p><strong>If you're like most new or expectant dads, you're probably carrying 
around some silent assumptions about what it means to be a father.</strong> 
Those ideas are rooted in your experiences with your own father and in what you 
believe society expects of a male parent. The various sections on this page 
should give you some basic reassurance!</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Marriage counseling <br>

<p><strong>Illness, infidelity, sex, anger, communication problems, parenting 
&mdash; all can contribute to distress in marriages or other relationships.
</strong> Marriage counseling or couples counseling can help resolve conflicts 
and heal wounds. Your partner comes home from work, makes a beeline for the 
liquor cabinet and then sulks off silently. You haven't had a real conversation 
for weeks. A few arguments over money or late nights out, sure, but no 
heart-to-hearts. Sex? What's that?</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Children's ways of love <br>

<p><strong>Individual children each have to be shown love in a way which is 
also very individual</strong>. For example, one daughter may receive love best 
when dad or mom gives her a very personalized gift&mdash;it could be a note, a 
set of gel pens or a t-shirt, but she knows she is loved when someone gives her 
something. Trying to use the technique that worked for one child with the other 
would be useless.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Five commandments for today's family man <br>

<p><strong>Two years ago, I was getting a little woozy as I stared at the 
proof pages of a magazine I was editing.</strong> It was 4am. I had phoned my 
wife five times that night, promising to come home soon with each call. I 
really did love the work I was doing, but not seeing my kids for the whole day 
left me feeling empty. The worst of the calls involved hearing my youngest 
wailing in the background as my then six-year-old got on the line to say, 
&quot;You're not even going to cuddle with us tonight?&quot;</p> Read more...

<li> Bonding with the new baby <br>

<p><strong>&nbsp;When your new baby makes its appearance, it can be a 
challenge for both mom and dad to connect with the new baby.</strong> Lack of 
sleep and the other demands of being a new parent can wear thin on both fathers 
and mothers... But mom tends to have a better opportunity to get close to the 
new baby simply because she usually spends more time at it. And yet dads often 
feel a significant need to get close to the new baby, but have a challenge 
getting there. So we asked some new dads and some of the experts about how best 
to help dads bond with their babies.</p> Read more... </li>

<li> Non-violent relationships: A role for fathers <br>

<p><strong>Good fathers help their boys treat women with respect</strong> They 
lead by example by respecting their partners, wives, and the mothers of their 
children. Boys learn from their fathers to treat women with respect, not to use 
violence to get their way or solve their relationship problems. They let their 
daughters know that they must not accept abusive behaviour from men as the 
norm. They help their daughters to tell men that their father would never use 
abuse towards them, would not sanction their brothers or other relatives to do 
it so why should they accept it from any other man? Fathers play a critical 
role in providing their children with safe home environments that are free from 
abuse and neglect. All children deserve a chance to grow up unafraid.</p> Read

<li> Activities for dads and kids <br>

<p><strong>Playing with our children is more important than we may realize.

positive father involvement has a beneficial effect on kids and their dads.</p>

<li> Divorce: Your child's perspective <br>

<p><strong>Children usually feel a lot of pain and emotional conflict during 
and after divorce.</strong> Whether or not your children say it or show it, you 
can be sure they are deeply affected by the divorce and the struggles around 
it. The article below gives excellent insight into what your child may be 
thinking, feeling and needing from you.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Do you have to be at your baby's birth? <br>

<p><strong>&nbsp;It's up to you!</strong> Two decades ago it was unusual for a 
father to be there when his child was born. These days, for urban dads it's 
more unusual if he isn't there. For many couples, being together is what feels 
right. But not everyone feels the same.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Children's expectations of you and your ex <br>

<p><strong>Marriage is a contract between adults, and when it ends, the matter 
is between the adults - not, repeat, not the kids!</strong> Yet, no parental 
action has a greater impact on children. Children love their parents and want 
to be with them. Even in times of great stress, parents have a responsibility 
to conduct their legal affairs in a manner that will protect their children 
from adult conflicts. Try to agree with your ex the following. Then discuss it 
with your child or children.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> The birth - tips for dads <br>

<p><strong>If you aren't nervous about labour and delivery, you're either in 
denial or not paying attention!</strong> Remember that as difficult as it may 
be to watch your partner or loved one in pain, most fathers find the birth of 
their child to be one of life's most powerful and satisfying moments. Of 
course, it's better if know that you've been a help rather than a hindrance. To 
help you be the kind of birth partner a labouring woman dreams of, William 
Wade, a father of one, asked people who've been there to share their feelings.

<li> I have been violent or abusive and I need help <br>

<p><strong>'Sometimes when we argue and I shout at my partner she is scared of 
me'</strong>, 'I slapped her once and I promised myself it would never happen 
again - but I hit her again...', 'I get angry with her and I totally lose 
it...' Do you recognise yourself in any of that? Are you concerned that your 
behaviour towards your partner is costing you your relationship? Are you 
worried your children are witnessing too many arguments between their parents?

<li> Tips on stress <br>

<p><strong>Set aside time for yourself. Sit and read a book for 10 minutes.
</strong> It&rsquo;s easy to get stressed as you juggle family, washing, 
cooking, cleaning, getting from A to B, money etc. There are times when too 
much stress makes life really difficult as everything seems too huge and too 
hard.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> She's not made of porcelain! <br>

<p><strong>From the beginning, it&rsquo;s crucial that fathers nurture a 
daughter&rsquo;s image of her body as strong, healthy, capable, and active...
</strong> That means you might have to overcome a common misperception first, 
that of thinking of your daughter as delicate or fragile. Many dads I meet 
share this mistaken idea:</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Stepfathering <br>

<p><strong>Stepfathers face significant challenges as they move into a 
situation where they are often unwanted and unappreciated.</strong> It takes 
special skills and attitudes to be a successful stepfather. This page contains 
resources for stepfathers and fathers in blended families. Once the initial 
settling in is over, there is the challenging task of building a new family. 
This doesn't mean that old families are forgotten, of course, but simply 
involves creating a new branch. The list of potential adjustments is long, and 
it calls for a considerable amount of patience.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Dealing with anger - your own and your child's <br>

<p><strong>Divorce can bring out the worst in people.</strong> It can cause an 
exceptional parent to lose focus on what is best for his/her children, which in 
turn can cause the children to feel mistreated. It seems some parents 
can&rsquo;t divorce their bad feelings for an ex spouse from their feelings for 
their children. When those negative feelings bleed over into the relationship 
with children, the result is a fractured child/parent relationship.</p> Read

<li> Staying together for the sake of the kids <br>

<p><strong>Which is better for your kids? Should you stay together for the 
sake of the kids, or have a good divorce and set positive role models for your 
kids?</strong> The issue is whether or not divorced couples can raise children 
who fare better in life as adults than unhappy couples who stay together for 
the sake of the kids. It is generally accepted that children learn both good 
and dysfunctional patterns and behavior from their parents.</p> Read more...

<li> Daughters and single dads <br>

<p><strong>Whether you are divorced or separated and the custodial parent, or

shoes, here are some suggestions for tackling this important task successfully.

<li> Do you use domestic violence? <br>

<p><strong>If you are violent in your relationship you are a Perpetrator of 
Domestic Violence and need to accept that fact and try and get help.</strong> 
&ldquo;Do no harm,&rdquo; must be the mantra of every man in our society and 
especially fathers. Situations of family and relationship violence impact 
couples, but can be particularly harmful for children.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Can men get the baby blues? <br>

<p><strong>My wife had a baby a couple of weeks ago and, after the initial 
elation I am surprised to find myself feeling quite down.</strong> Can men get 
something like the baby blues as well as women? Yes, fathers are vulnerable to 
similar emotions to a new mother, and there's some evidence that new dads can 
become depressed after the birth of a baby as well. That's one of the reasons 
we know that the baby blues aren't exclusively caused by hormonal changes.</p>

<li> Boxers or briefs? Facts about men's fertility <br>

<p><strong>Men's part in fertilization is quite amazing.</strong> About 200 
million sperm are mixed with semen to form ejaculate. In most men, 15 to 45 
million of these sperm are healthy enough to fertilize an egg, although only 
400 survive after a man ejaculates. Only 40 of those 400 reach the vicinity of 
the egg, surviving the toxic environment of the semen and the hostile 
environment of the vagina. After another process called capacitation (an 
explosion that allows the remaining sperm to drill a hole through the tough 
outer layer of the egg), only one lone sperm reaches the egg for fertilization 
and conception.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> It's you she wants in the delivery room <br>

<p><strong>Be there for her! (and for yourself)</strong> What is the role of 
the father who is present at the birth of his child? Is he a labor coach, 
advocate or partner? Is he a fifth wheel? A nuisance? A liability? In the 
twelve years that I have served birthing families in my community, I have heard 
many passionate opinions about the presence of fathers at birth. Over the years 
my own understanding of the role that fathers play in pregnancy and birth has 
developed to become much deeper and more complex as I have served different 
families, each with their own unique relationship, culture, expectations and 
beliefs.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Raising your daughter <br>

<p><strong>Every father and stepfather can make a huge difference in his 
daughter&rsquo;s life!</strong> A father is the first man his daughter knows. 
With that potent position of &ldquo;first man&rdquo; comes the ability to set 
the norm of manliness for her&mdash;a norm that ultimately can be stronger than 
what anyone else tells her!</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Dads play with kids can make a big difference <br>

<p><strong>There is growing evidence that fathers influence the healthy 
development of their children and that positive father involvement has a 
beneficial effect on kids and their dads.</strong>Be it gardening together, 
singing to babies, playing building blocks with toddlers or just throwing the 
ball in the backyard, regular interactions between dads and their children help 
them to develop into happy healthy children.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Real dads play dolls <br>

<p><strong>Is playing with dolls manly? Of course it is!</strong> That&rsquo;s 
a question that occurs to many fathers and stepfathers of daughters. And most 
of us believe that real men don&rsquo;t play dolls. That belief is of little 
use once you have a stepdaughter or daughter. In fact, it may be a major 
barrier in the work of building a strong bond with her.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> The effects of divorce on children and how to cope <br>

<p><strong>It is hard to imagine a more difficult transition for a child than 
to be a party to his or her parents' divorce.</strong> I have watched this 
closely the last few months as some very good friends of ours have been 
separated and preparing for divorce. And even through attempts at 
reconciliation through family counseling, the children have suffered. There 
have been many empirical studies focusing on the effects of divorce on 
children. Some of the common findings among all of these studies are detailed 
in this article.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Infidelity: Mending your marriage after an affair <br>

<p><strong>Infidelity causes intense emotional pain &mdash; anger, disbelief, 
fear, guilt, shame.</strong> But an affair doesn't have to mean the end of your 
marriage. Understand how a marriage can be rebuilt after an affair. When an 
affair is first discovered, both partners feel as if the world has collapsed 
&mdash; you're left wondering whether your marriage can survive.</p> Read

<li> Disciplining for Dads <br>

<p><strong>One of the biggest challenges for fathers is selecting appropriate 
discipline for their children.</strong> <br>
Discipline is all about modifying 
behavior, not about anger or retaliation. Ever felt that your anger was getting 
the best of you? As we discipline children, anger is an emotion that must be 
controlled. After all, we are trying to change behavior and teach self 
control--we can't lose ours in the process. Find ways to keep anger under 
control as you work with your children.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Prevention of HIV transmission to Infants <br>

<p><strong>Many people know nothing or very little about the Mother To Child 
Treatment programmes that can prevent babies contracting HIV.</strong> Men are 
even more marginalized and are not in a position to support their spouses, 
partners, and sisters in participating in the programmes.Counselling is a major 
factor affecting women and their partners' choices regarding voluntary HIV 
testing and subsequent participation in the programmes.</p> Read more... </li>

<p><strong>A good laugh helps break the tension.</strong> Instead of backing
