<h1>05/10/2011Language learning for adults and how to make it work</h1> 
<h2> <strong>Almost all the adults I know think learning a new language in 
adulthood is impossible. A new foreign language can be difficult to learn, and 
linguists agree. Here are some tips to stay motivated.</strong></h2> Related 
Articles <br>

<h2>How expats are learning the local lingo</h2> 
<h2>Expat children and language learning</h2>  Steven Pinker, for one, thinks 
the &ldquo;language instinct&rdquo; is lost somewhere around puberty. Children 
are linguistic geniuses, adults linguistic dolts. Pinker points out that Walter 
Kissinger (Henry&rsquo;s younger brother) has no German accent, though sixty 
years after his emigration, Henry famously does.<br>
<br>
They came to the 
United States at the same time, in the crucial years around puberty. 
Walter&rsquo;s advantage, Pinker surmises, was being a few years younger than 
his brother when they moved. This allowed him to absorb more English and kick 
his accent. (According to Pinker, the accent is as much a part of the language 
instinct as&nbsp;is grammar.)<br>
<br>
 Learning a language in adulthood is 
difficult&mdash;nothing can replace the childhood environment, much less the 
childhood brain. However, with patience and persistence, it can be done. To 
produce a foreign language requires more than lips, teeth and tongue&mdash;it 
requires ears, eyes and mental agility. You must listen carefully and then 
imitate. <br>
&nbsp;  Language is like jazz: both are spontaneous compositions 
derived from a finite set of elements (notes or words). But the jazz analogy 
may compel people to think that they simply don&rsquo;t have the talent. What 
they don&rsquo;t realize is how obsessively John Coltrane practiced, repeating 
scales and arpeggios over and over again to build up the skills he would need 
to make that freeform composition on the stage seem so effortless.<br>
<br>
 It 
is exactly the same way when composing a foreign language.<br>
<br>
 I&rsquo;ve 
learned Spanish, German, French, Portuguese and Russian&mdash;all post-puberty. 
And recently, I started Arabic&mdash;by far the hardest language I&rsquo;ve 
studied. Though I was frustrated at first, now that I have a better teacher and 
a good textbook, I&rsquo;m making rapid progress. Every student of language is 
different, but here are some strategies that have helped me:<br>
<br>
Slow and 
steady <br>
<br>
Regular practice is by far the most important element in 
learning a language. Students often try to cram as much into their heads as 
fast as they can which leads to frustration and fatigue. If taking a class, 
they are exposed to the language only one to three times a week, plus the time 
they spend on homework.<br>
<br>
 It is far more helpful to spend five minutes 
twice a day, every day, thinking, reading and talking in the language. Where 
and when, though? As you learn, practice out loud whenever you are alone. While 
you walk to the train station, or sit in stop-and-go traffic, review to 
yourself. Start simple: &ldquo;I go to work. I am in the car. I live in New 
York.&rdquo; Repeat these basics over and over, and then vary the subject. 
&ldquo;Steve goes to work. Steve is in his car. Steve lives in New York.&rdquo;
<br> <br>
Repeat, repeat, repeat. You will then feel a thrill as you proceed to 
compound sentences, tenses, and modal verbs (should, would, must, may). 
&ldquo;I am going to work, because I have to. I live in New York, and I love it 
here.&rdquo; Those steps beyond baby talk are exciting. <br>
Take a class <br>

&nbsp;If you live in any medium-sized city, a foreign-language class is not 
hard to find. If you are in a big city, you will be spoiled for choice. New 
York University, for example, offers dozens of classes in a wide variety of 
languages from Norwegian to Yiddish to Persian, for around USD450 a semester.
<br> <br>
Attending a class is the single best way to motivate 
yourself&mdash;the desire to impress a teacher and classmates will help keep 
you on task. If you have the means to get a private tutor, even better. But be 
sure to get a recommendation from a knowledgeable friend&mdash;not every native 
speaker is a good teacher.  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
 (Illustration above by &nbsp; Markus)&nbsp; <br>

Teach yourself <br>
Learning a foreign language all by yourself is extremely 
difficult&mdash;and probably not a good idea if it&rsquo;s your first one. 
However, if you decide to go the autodidact route, make sure to buy top-notch 
books, audio CDs, and computer programs.<br>
<br>
 A good book can get you far 
in a language with an easy spelling system, like Spanish or Italian. I&rsquo;ve 
found Routledge&rsquo;s &ldquo;Colloquial&rdquo; series to be fairly good. But 
for languages with irregular spelling (French or Danish, say), or unfamiliar 
sounds (Chinese or Hindi), it&rsquo;s better to get a book that comes with 
audio CDs. The &ldquo;Ultimate&rdquo; series from Random House has a 
straightforward, building-block structure, with practical vocabulary and lucid 
explanations.<br>
<br>
 Computer software has something to offer as well. But 
don&rsquo;t expect miraculous results. I reviewed the Danish version of the 
widely marketed Rosetta Stone series here. Short version: you will learn 
grammar and vocabulary surprisingly quickly with this novel (and expensive) 
software, but you won&rsquo;t learn practical stuff at all.<br>
<br>
While 
focusing on grammar building blocks, the program sacrifices basic elements of 
conversation such as &ldquo;hello&rdquo; or &ldquo;my name is&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;help!&rdquo; Though you&rsquo;ll be able to say, &ldquo;There is not an 
elephant under the airplane,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not sure you&rsquo;ll ever have a 
reason to use this sentence in daily conversation.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Rosetta 
Stone has another drawback. Each lesson is structured exactly the 
same&mdash;identical exercises in the same order. This is bad 
practice&mdash;different languages pose different challenges. Also, many 
languages have structures Rosetta Stone isn&rsquo;t equipped to teach: the 
Arabic dual number (words have singular, dual and plural endings), the Russian 
verbal aspect system, the Spanish subjunctive and so forth are all distinctive. 
Rosetta&rsquo;s software does not address any of these eccentricities.<br>
<br>

Surround yourself <br>
Whenever possible, bring the language into your 
immediate world. The &ldquo;10 Minutes a Day&rdquo; series of books is 
generally useless, as if written for not particularly bright six-year-olds, but 
they do come with small stickers you can attach to items all around your house. 
This is an excellent vocabulary-building technique. If every time you reach for 
your coffee mug you see chashka (Russian for cup) and you say the word to 
yourself, it will stick in your head.<br>
<br>
 Nearly every language in the 
world can be found on the Internet. The BBC, in fact, broadcasts everything 
from Spanish to Bengali. (You can check out their 33-language menu here).<br>

<br>  As you potter around the house, listen to the day&rsquo;s news in your 
language of choice. You don&rsquo;t need to understand everything, but this 
will both help you feel the rhythm and become accustomed to the accent. 
You&rsquo;ll get a crucial psychological boost when you can make out a few 
words, then phrases and sentences, in a row. Do this every few days and 
you&rsquo;ll be surprised by your progress.<br>
<br>
Read <br>
BBC.com also has 
written material that you can practice with. The news stories in each of those 
33 languages are written in a clear, simple style for a worldwide audience. 
When you&rsquo;re ready, try to read a news story a week, especially about 
something you&rsquo;re familiar with.<br>
<br>
This is crucial&mdash;reading an 
article about unfamiliar material is distressingly complex. But if you know the 
subject, it can be pleasantly easy, since you&rsquo;ll be able to guess many 
unfamiliar words. You&rsquo;ll need to start out with a dictionary, but once 
you learn frequently-used words, you&rsquo;ll be able to go without it and 
guess most of the things you don&rsquo;t know.<br>
<br>
You can also read books 
that have been translated from English into your chosen language&mdash;all the 
better if it&rsquo;s a book you know. I have a copy of Nick Hornby&rsquo;s High 
Fidelity in German, for example. Hornby&rsquo;s clear English is translated 
into similarly clear German, without some of the convoluted sentence structures 
many native Germans use. I know the original book and movie, so I myself can 
zip through it.<br>
<br>
 When you are ready to move to the next level and read 
unfamiliar books in this language, ask a native which authors write in an easy, 
clear style. If you were helping a foreigner try to learn English, for example, 
you would suggest Hemingway, not David Foster Wallace. Similarly, someone 
learning German would do well to start with Kafka rather than Thomas Mann.<br>

<br> Find a friend who speaks the language <br>
This is obvious, but practice 
with a native speaker is enormously helpful. If you&rsquo;re lucky enough to 
have a good friend who is a native speaker&mdash;or best of all, a 
girlfriend/boyfriend or housemate (someone you see all the time)&mdash;take 
advantage of him or her. Don&rsquo;t wait until you feel totally comfortable, 
or you&rsquo;ll never start. Make it fun, make it a routine, and do so early.
<br> <br>
Relax <br>
The biggest hurdle to learning a language is 
psychological. If you&rsquo;re nervous about blundering through a new language 
in front of strangers, the best way to relax is to start slowly. At a local 
coffee shop staffed exclusively by young Polish blondes, I take my muffin and 
coffee away with a &ldquo;dziekuje.&rdquo; (Thank-you.)<br>
<br>
My 
pronunciation isn&rsquo;t perfect, but it never fails to win a slightly 
surprised smile. Next step? I&rsquo;ll order the coffee in Polish, too. Then, 
I&rsquo;ll try &ldquo;goodbye.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
 When you&rsquo;re ready and 
have the chance, smile and try speaking with your teacher in the corridor, your 
cute Russian co-worker, the man who sells you cigarettes, or the waiter at your 
favorite restaurant. See that grin? Most people love to see you make the 
effort, and they will be happy to see you break out new vocabulary and longer 
sentences.  &nbsp;  If you kick yourself for every little slip-up (and 
you&rsquo;ll make many), you&rsquo;ll never progress. If you relax, simply 
communicate, and most of all enjoy, you can, with patience and effort, learn 
any language you want.  By Robert Lane Greene* <br>

step one towards language learning. You need to hit the ground running and

week. This is what worked for me: Radboud in'to Languages, Nijmegen.</p>  Add a
