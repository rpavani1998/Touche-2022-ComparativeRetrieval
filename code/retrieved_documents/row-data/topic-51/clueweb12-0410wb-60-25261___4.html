other NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) such as ibuprofen (Motrin, 
Advil), diclofenac (Voltaren), diflunisal (Dolobid), etodolac (Lodine),

<h2>How should I use rectal aspirin?</h2> 
<p>Use this medication exactly as directed on the label, or as it has been 
prescribed by your doctor. Do not use the medication in larger or smaller 
amounts, or use it for longer than recommended.</p> 
<p>This medication comes with patient instructions for using the rectal 
suppository. Follow these directions carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist 
if you have any questions.</p> Do not take rectal aspirin by mouth. It is for 
use only in your rectum. <br>
<br>

suppository. Try to use the medicine at a time when you can lie down afterward 
and hold the medicine in. Avoid using the bathroom during this time. It may be 
best to use this medicine at bedtime.</p>

handling the suppository too long or it will melt in your hands.</p>

dosing schedule. If you are using the medication regularly, use the missed dose 
as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the 
missed dose and wait until your next regularly scheduled dose.<b>Do not</b> use 
extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p> 
<h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2> Seek emergency medical attention if you 
think you have used too much of this medicine. <br>
<br>

uncontrolled muscle twitching, shortness of breath, bloody urine, 
hallucinations, or seizure (convulsions).</p>
