<h2>Beastie Boys Inducted Into Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame</h2> Friday, April

Beats, Self-Produced Music | pauly <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Beastie Boys Inducted Into Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame</p> If you&rsquo;re 
not familiar with the Beastie Boys, you&rsquo;ve missed out on one ofrap music
&lsquo;s original acts. The Beastie Boys, who first hit the charts in the 
1980&prime;s, introduced rap music to scores of white, middle-class suburban 
kids. Last week, The Beastie Boys, also known as Adam Horowitz, Adam Yauch, 
Michael Schwartz and Michael Diamond, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall 
of Fame.
<p></p> 
<h3>Honor For Just The Third Rap Act</h3> 
<p>The Beastie Boys are just the third rap group to be inducted into the Rock 
and Roll Hall of Fame, behind Run-DMC and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious 
Five. Rap masters LL Cool J and Chuckie D formally inducted the group.</p> 
<p>In its earliest years, the group was associated closely with producing 
legends Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin at Def Jam Records. The group credited 
other acts in the emerging rap music genre for their influences, including Bad 
Brains, The Slits, the Treacherous Three and XRay Spex. Four of the 
group&rsquo;s eight albums reached the top of the Billboard Album chart, 
including Licensed to Ill, Ill Communication, Hello Nasty and To the 5 
Boroughs. The group continues to perform today, and most recently released an 
album entitled Hot Sauce Committee Part Two in 2011.</p> 
<p>Their first release, New York Thrash, was a forerunner of the modern 
mixtape and preceded the release of their first EP, Polly Wog Stew (1982). 
Originally, the band worked in the hardcore metal genre, but successfully made 
the switch to rap early on. Since the group&rsquo;s inception, they&rsquo;ve 
sold more than 40 million albums world wide, about half of which were sold in 
the United States.</p> 
<p>The Beastie Boys made it big with the help of an established music 
producer, but they also helped to open the door for artists who want to produce 
their own music. The Beastie Boys were considered a 
&ldquo;groundbreaking&rdquo; act in the 1980&prime;s and served as many 
fans&rsquo; first introduction to the rap music genre. The group paired 
famously with Run-DMC for its Raising Hell tour in 1985 and first cracked the R 
&amp; B and Dance charts in the same year with &ldquo;Hold It Now, Hit 
It.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The Beastie Boys demonstrate that anyone can break into rap music and 
deliver a successful sound. For aspiring new musicians in the rap music genre, 
one of the best tools to have is DubTurbo, a complete music-production software 
package that lets you create your own musical style!</p>

<h2>Group Demonstrates Hip Hop&rsquo;s International Flair</h2> Friday, March 
23rd, 2012 |Beat Maker Software, Beat Making, Hip Hop, Music Production, 
Self-Produced Music | pauly <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Group Demonstrates Hip Hop's International Flair</p> If you&rsquo;ve never 
heard of Bliss n Eso, you&rsquo;re probably not alone, but it might surprise 
you to find out that Bliss and Eso are Australia&rsquo;s premierehip hop music 
artists, and have a professional music career that spans more than a decade. 
Bliss n Eso is actually a trio of musicians. MC Bliss, also known as Jonathan 
Notley, is an American. MC Eso, an Australian, is also known as Max MacKinnon, 
and DJ Izm, a Moroccan, known as Tarik Ejjamai, rounds out the group.
<p></p> 
<h3>Trio Takes To North America</h3> 
<p>The group met in high school and has performed together since that time. 
They occupy Australia&rsquo;s top spot in terms of hip-hop artists, in a field 
that&rsquo;s becoming more crowded every day. The group focuses on its lyrics 
and beats but has tried to avoid developing a predictable style.</p> 
<p>They regularly perform live and still include traditional rap techniques 
like scratching and beatboxing to achieve their unique sound. While 
they&rsquo;ve moved around from label to label, the group has also opened for 
some of rap&rsquo;s most recognizable acts, including 50 Cent, G-Unit, and Lil 
Jon. Bliss and Eso have been nominated for ARIA awards, Australia&rsquo;s 
version of the Grammys.</p> 
<p>Bliss n Eso aren&rsquo;t your typical hip-hop musical act, and have been 
very active in a number of charitable causes. The group&rsquo;s work has helped 
fund relief work in South Africa as well as in Victoria, Australia. 
They&rsquo;ve toured the US several times and have released four albums, one of 
which was certified gold and the group&rsquo;s most recent release, Running on 
Air, was certified platinum.</p> 
<p>If any of this surprises you, it shouldn&rsquo;t. Hip-hop, as a musical 
artform, has demonstrated itself to be among the most culturally flexible, and 
has inspired musicians and artists from all over the world. New musicians find 
the genre to be welcoming, and relatively easy to break into, compared to other 
musical genres like rock.</p> 
<p>Hip-hop, when combined with the ability to self-produce, self-publicize and 
self-distribute music, turns out to be highly appealing to listeners all over 
the world. There&rsquo;s no easier way to start in the music business today 
than by producing your own hip-hop and rap beats.</p> 
<p>Unlike other genres, it&rsquo;s both acceptable and expected that artists 
who are just trying to break into the music scene will create and distribute 
free mixtapes of their music. If you&rsquo;re an aspiring artist and are 
considering going this route, check out some of the best tools available on the 
market today, like dubTurbo and Sonic Producer. Download your copy of one or 
both of these applications, and you&rsquo;ll be making your own unique sounds 
in no time!</p>

<h2>Grammy Awards Should Inspire New Rap Beats</h2> Friday, February 10th, 
2012 |Beat Maker Software, Beat Making, Hip Hop, Music Production, Rap Beats, 
Self-Produced Music | pauly <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Grammy Awards Should Inspire New Rap Beats</p> The Grammy Awards, 
music&rsquo;s highest honor, will be somewhat different than it has been in 
past years. This year, for the first time, more than 30 musical categories in 
which Grammy Awards had been issued, will no longer be eligible for special 
recognition. To be sure,rap beats won&rsquo;t be among those cut out of the 
action, but the move should shake up musicians and rap artists anyway.
<p></p> 
<h3>New Generation Of Music</h3> 
<p>For some musicians, self-production is the way to get into the music scene. 
Most of the music genres being cut from the Grammy Awards this year will fall 
into the category of &ldquo;niche&rdquo; music. Rap isn&rsquo;t niche anymore; 
it&rsquo;s definitely mainstream.</p> 
<p>However, many of the genres that are being cut are filled with artists who 
self-produce their music, largely because big labels aren&rsquo;t interested in 
musicians with very small potential audiences. Self-produced music is a way of 
life for these folks. Self-produced music is growing in popularity, even among 
genres that can&rsquo;t be considered &ldquo;niche,&rdquo; like rap.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s never been easier than it is today to get into the music 
business. With the excellent software tools that are on the market today, a 
novice can put together a debut album that has all the sound quality of a 
professional studio recording. Musicians also have a lot of control over their 
sounds.</p> 
<p>With the tools of music self-production, artists can create music in their 
way, using their own equipment. Better still, up-and-coming performers can 
distribute their music to audiences inexpensively and without the need for 
studios. The Internet makes it possible to reach the audiences musicians are 
looking for, and it also makes it possible for listeners to find the musicians 
they&rsquo;re most interested in.</p> 
<p>With products like Sonic Producer, musicians can make their own music. 
Sonic Producer also comes with thousands of royalty-free sample tracks and 
videos that can help new music producers make the most of their investment in 
Sonic Producer!</p> 
<p>Self-production is a great way to reach the audience you&rsquo;re trying to 
find, and still maintain ultimate control of your music. You don&rsquo;t need 
to worry about recording contracts, paying royalties to other artists, or not 
having a distribution channel for your music. Sonic Producer provides you with 
the recording software you need to make your music, record your music into a 
digital file format, and package it for distribution among the many channels 
that are available to musicians today.</p> 
<p>Download your copy of Sonic Producer today and get your beats up in the air!
