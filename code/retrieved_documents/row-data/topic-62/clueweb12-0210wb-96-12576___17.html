<h1>OU-P: What&rsquo;s New For &lsquo;11?</h1> 
<p>By: Rabbi Shmuel Singer</p> 
<p>Kedem continues to bottle grape juice under its own name as well as under 
the Savion, Gefen and Lipschutz labels. All these items have always been and 
will continue to be Mevushal. Kedem has one not Mevushal grape juice. This is 
bottled in 1.5 liter glass bottles and clearly labeled Non-Mevushal. 
Manischewitz will once again have an OU-P grape juice under its own label. This 
grape juice is made from concentrate. Kedem will offer a variety of OU-P 
Sparkling Grape Juices. These grape juices are Mevushal. Kedem will also 
produce a variety of OU-P cooking wines. Kedem has introduced Pomegranate and 
Sparkling Pomogrape Juices with the OU-P certification as new items this year. 
Two new alcoholic OU-P items will be available. Jelinek will have OU-P pear 
brandy in addition to traditional slivovitz and Distillerie will have OU-P gin.
</p> 
<p>The OU has certified the Manischewitz matzah bakery in the United States 
for the past years. For a long time this was the only OU matzah bakery in the 
world. It continues to be the only one in the United States. Other OU-P brands 
such as Horowitz Margareten and Goodman&rsquo;s are all baked at Manischewitz. 
The bakery has relocated and is fully functioning this year. All regular 
Manischewitz items will again be available. The OU has also agreed to place the 
OU-P on Aviv, Osem, Yehuda and Rishon matzah products coming from Israel. The 
items are supervised by local Rabbanim and are satisfactorily made with OU 
Pesach guidelines. They are certified by the OU when the OU-P appears on them. 
In addition, we have this year certified Yanovsky matzah baked in Argentina. 
This matzah is widely distributed in Latin America. This company manufactures 
various types of matzah. All matzah is always an eighteen minute product. Rabbi 
Feigelstock of Buenos Aires serves as the OU rav hamachshir at this factory.</p>
<p>Manischewitz has whole wheat matzah meal and whole wheat matzah farfel. 
These items are made from Manischewitz OU-P whole wheat matzah. Manischewitz 
will again have traditional egg matzah. This product is Matzah Ashirah and is 
permitted for Sefardim or Ashkenazim who cannot eat regular matzah. It is so 
marked on the box. Manischewitz produces Passover Tams which are small egg 
matzah crackers coated with different flavorings. They are marked as Matzah 
Ashirah on the box. Manischewitz will continue to sell OU-P machine shmurah 
matzah under both the Manischewitz and Goodman&rsquo;s labels. In addition, 
OU-P hand shmurah matzah will be available from Kfar Chabad and Rokeach. Kedem 
will be selling, as they did last year, Savion matzah sticks. This is matzah 
baked in stick form under the Savion label. Manischewitz makes a product known 
as matzah crackers. Both of these are ordinary matzah products and not matzah 
ashirah. The various Israeli OU matzah companies will all be selling machine 
shmurah matzah as well. In addition the OU-P symbol will appear on Geula and 
Haddar matzah and matzah products.</p> 
<p>Coca Cola will again be available with an OU-P for Pesach. Aside from the 
New York metropolitan area, Coke will be available in Boston, 
Baltimore-Washington, Miami, Atlanta, Houston, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles. 
This year, in New York, Coca Cola items will be made with an OU-P in 2 liter 
bottles. All these items, of course, require the P symbol. Most of the bottling 
plants servicing these markets will designate the Passover Coke items with a 
distinctive yellow cap in addition to the P symbol on the cap or shoulder of 
the bottle.</p> 
<p>All the Haddar Passover items will now be available with the OU-P symbol. 
The traditional OU-P candy brands such as Oneg, Alprose, Elite and Empress will 
again be available. This year the Barton brand will be back again with the 
OU-P. A full line of Barricini candy items will be available with the OU-P 
symbol. Elyon, Manischewitz, Gefen and Granny&rsquo;s will continue to have 
OU-P marshmallows. Manischewitz will have a number of new items including 
chocolate covered cherries, marshmallows and biscotti. Shkedia will also be 
selling chocolate covered items such as nuts and citrus peel.</p> 
<p>This year the OU-P will appear on various Cholov Yisroel dairy products. 
Norman&rsquo;s has introduced the OU-P Machmirim brand of yogurt. In addition 
there will be OU-P Cholov Yisroel goat cheese and sheep cheese from Barkanit 
and mozzarella, provolone and pecorino cheese from Yotvata. Haddar will be 
selling OU-P Cholov Yisroel milk powder. Cabot Creamery will be introducing 
OU-P cheddar cheese. This item is not Cholov Yisroel.</p> 
<p>There will be two OU-P brands of packaged cakes available this year. These 
will be Reisman and Lily&rsquo;s Bakeshop. These lines will be more extensive 
than last year. Both are baked in a special Passover bakery and do not contain 
matzah meal. In addition the Willmark line of industrial bakery products has 
been purchased byVIP and many of these items are appearing with the OU-P label 
this year. Gedilla and Gefen cookies will be available with OU-P. Bernies Foods 
will have Frankels blintzes, waffles and pizza as well as LeTova Kichel and 
bread sticks. These are all not made with matzah meal. Dayenu pizza, rolls and 
pierogies are made with matzah meal. Gefen will have a full line of cake mixes 
and hot cereal items. Those contain no matzah meal.</p> 
<p>Manischewitz has kept the Season name on OU-P fish items which include 
tuna, sardines, salmon and anchovies. Season has introduced a number of new 
Moroccan sardine items in various sauces for Pesach. All of these items are 
made with Mashgiach Temidi and bishul yisrael. In addition, the Season label 
will continue to appear on OU-P bamboo shoots and water chestnuts as well as 
some sauces and oil. Tuna fish is available with an OU-P from Season, Gefen and 
Mishpacha. In addition Shoprite OU-P tuna fish in water will be available. 
Season and Gefen will have OU-P salmon in both regular and no salt versions. 
All these items are made with Mashgiach Temidi and Bishul Yisrael. Dr. 
Praeger&rsquo;s continues to produce breaded fish fillets and fish sticks with 
an OU-P. These products contain no matzah meal. In addition, Ratner&rsquo;s 
will have a line of OU-P pancakes and blintzes. These do contain matzah meal.
</p> 
<p>The OU position remains that extra virgin olive oil can be used without 
special supervision for Pesach. In addition, Bartenura, Carmel, Gefen and 
Mishpacha olive oil will be available with an OU-P label. Mother&rsquo;s olive 
oil pan coating spray, Mishpacha olive oil spray and Manischewitz buttery 
safflower cooking spray, olive oil spray and olive oil garlic cooking sprays 
will also be available. Prepared olives with an OU-P will be available from 
Gefen, Osem, Kvuzat Yavne, Gilboa and Mishpacha. Bartenura will be introducing 
an OU-P grapeseed oil this year.</p> 
<p>Manischewitz, Mishapacha, Rokeach and Savion will continue to make OU-P 
sauces. These include different types of tomato sauce, dressings and marinades. 
Savion will have an OU-P line of sauces known as Fireman&rsquo;s Frenzy. These 
include spicy marinades, salsa and spicy ketchup. In addition,VIP and Kojel wil 
have OU-P ready to eat soup in a bowl items.</p> 
<p>The OU position remains that regular tea bags, which are not flavored or 
decaffeinated, are acceptable for Pesach without special supervision. In 
addition we have clarified once again this year that all Lipton decaffeinated 
tea bags are acceptable without special supervision. This is not true of other 
decaffeinated tea bags. Shoprite also has specially marked OU-P plain tea bags 
on the market. In addition Swee-Touch-Nee and Wissotsky will continue to have 
Pesach herbal teas. Nestea instant unflavored tea powder and instant unflavored 
decaffeinated tea powder are acceptable for Pesach without special supervision.
<b>Our position in former years in regard to coffee had been similar to tea. We 
maintained that all regular coffee, that is unflavored and not decaffeinated, 
is acceptable for Pesach without supervision. This is no longer true. Some 
coffee companies add maltodextrin, which is either chametz or kitniyos, to 
instant coffee. As a result this coffee is not kosher for Passover. Only coffee 
bearing an OU-P symbol or brands listed in the gray area of the Passover 
Directory should be used. Both Folger&rsquo;s and Taster&rsquo;s Choice instant 
coffee remain acceptable. Other brands should be checked in the Directory. 
Ground coffee remains acceptable from any source as long as it is unflavored 
and not decaffeinated.</b></p> 
<p>This year a number of supermarket labels will have OU-P flavored seltzers 
for Pesach. These include America&rsquo;s Choice, Shoprite and Price Chopper.
</p> 
<p>Two new OU-P labels available this year are Guss OU-P pickles and Sonny 
&amp; Joe&rsquo;s line of salads, dips and pickles. In addition Kirkland OU-P 
Apple Juice will be available for the first time. Two other new products are 
Gefen almond butter and Haddar almond butter and cashew butter. In addition 
Health Garden OU-P xylitol will be available. This is a non-sugar based 
sweetener. Another new item is Jane&rsquo;s Crazy Mixed-Up salt which is an 
OU-P salt and seasoning mixture.</p> 
<p>It remains the position of the OU Poskim that aluminum pans do not require 
Passover supervision. Pro Pak will be producing a line of OU-P parchment paper 
and Plasti Made food storage bags.</p> Back to OU Passover Home Page Print

<h1>Medicine Guidelines</h1> 
<p><b>1.</b> Known and tested medications in the form of creams, non-chewable 
pills and injections may be owned, used and consumed on Passover, even if they 
contain chametz or kitniyot, since they are inedible. This covers most 
medicines used by adults.<br>
 If an equally effective chametz-free alternative 
is available or procurable, this should be used instead.<br>
 a. It is 
permissible to grind pills and mix the powder into food items so that a child 
can take medicine on Passover. However, a doctor must be consulted to make sure 
that the child is getting the correct dosage and that the potency of the pill 
is not compromised by altering its consistency.<br>
<b>2.</b> Liquid medicines, 
chewable pills and pills coated with a flavored glaze are considered palatable 
and may contain chametz. Also Gelcaps may present a problem because they may 
contain non-kosher edible gelatin.<br>
 Therefore:<br>
 a. If possible, they 
should be replaced &mdash;under the direction of a doctor &mdash; with a 
nonchewable, uncoated pill.<br>
 b. If substitution is not possible and the 
person is in a state of sakanah or safek sakanah (any possible danger to human 
life), the medication<br>
 may be owned and consumed. The same applies if the 
condition is not yet a safek sakanah but may deteriorate to that point.<br>
 A 
Rabbi should be consulted as to whether it is preferable to purchase the 
medicine before or on Passover, and as to how to dispose of the medicine once 
the danger passes.<br>
 c. If substitution is not possible and a doctor 
determines that there is no possibility of sakanah if the person does not take 
the medicine, a Rabbi should be consulted. He may be able to determine that the 
medicine does not contain chametz and/or kitniyot, or he may decide that the 
medicine may be consumed due to the seriousness of the patient&rsquo;s 
condition.<br>
<b>3.</b> In many cases, medicinal items which contain kitniyot 
are permitted for people who are ill. Questions on this issue should be 
directed to your Rabbi.<br>
<b>4.</b> You should exercise extreme caution and 
consult with your doctor and Rabbi before making a decision not to take a 
medicine.<br>
<b>5.</b> These guidelines do not address the more general 
prohibition of consuming medicines on Shabbat and Yom Tov.</p> 
<p><b>The following medications are under the supervison of the OU and have 
been found to be free of<i>chometz</i> but do contain <i>kitniyot</i></b>:<br>
 
Children&rsquo;s Triaminic Syrup Multi-Symptom Fever, Bubble Gum<br>

<h1>Kashering for Passover</h1> 
<p>One of the many preparations one must make for Pesach is <i>kashering</i>, 
a process to prepare<i>chametz </i>vessels for Pesach use. (Although most 
people only kasher their utensils in preparation for Pesach, the following 
directions apply to<i>kashering </i>utensils all year-round as well.) As with 
all areas of<i>halachah</i>, those who are unsure of how to apply the rules of 
<i>kashering </i>to their situation should consult their local Orthodox Rabbi. 
</p> 
<p><b>General rules</b></p> 
<p>There are two steps in kashering: 1. Cleaning&mdash;removing all tangible 
traces of chametz, and 2. Purging&mdash;using heat to remove all absorbed 
chametz flavor.</p> 
<p><b>Cleaning</b></p> 
<p>All chametz utensils that will be used for Pesach must first be thoroughly 
cleaned.</p> 
<p>This involves the removal of all food, rust, dirt, calcium deposits and 
anything else that protrudes; it does not include the removal of 
discolorations. Items which have narrow cracks, crevices, deep scratches or 
other areas that cannot easily be cleaned, cannot be kashered for Pesach. 
Therefore, the following, for example, cannot be kashered: &bull; Colanders 
&bull; Decanters or baby bottles (due to their narrow necks) &bull; 
Filters/screens over drains in sinks &bull; Graters &bull; Knives (or other 
utensils) where food or dirt can get trapped between the blade and handle 
&bull; Slotted spoons &bull; Sponges &bull; Toothbrushes</p> 
<p>Additionally, the common custom is to cover tables, counters, refrigerator 
shelves and other areas where one might not have been able to clean away every 
trace of chametz.</p> 
<p><b>Purging</b></p> 
<p>In addition to cleaning, most items require some form of hot purging in 
order to remove the flavor that has been absorbed. As a rule, any utensil that 
came in contact with hot food, was washed with hot water or was used to store 
liquids, requires hot purging. A comprehensive analysis regarding when hot 
purging is required and how one determines which form of purging is effective 
is beyond the scope of this article. Rather we will describe the standard 
method of purging flavor from the most common items.</p> 
<p>Utensils made from the following materials cannot be kashered: &bull; 
Ceramic&mdash;all types&mdash;including brick, china, coffee mugs and enamel. 
&bull; Glass&mdash;all forms&mdash;including Corning Ware, Corelle, fiberglass, 
porcelain enamel (for example, porcelain sinks and enamelized pots), Pyrex or 
Thermoses. &bull; Plastic&mdash;Rabbinical authorities disagree as to whether 
it is possible to kasher plastic and other synthetic materials (including 
Teflon, rubber, Formica). You should consult your local Rabbi. If a synthetic 
material is a minority component of a substance (like Silestone), many rabbis 
believe that one may kasher it, even if one does not normally kasher artificial 
materials for a number of reasons.</p> 
<p>As a rule, materials such as fabric, metal, wood, rubber and stone (for 
example, granite and marble) can be kashered.</p> 
<p><b>Specific Items</b></p> 
<p>All methods of kashering noted in this section presuppose that the 
equipment was thoroughly cleaned, as described above.</p> 
<p><b>Silverware, Pots and Other Small Items</b><br>
 Small items are kashered 
with<i>hagalah</i>, which involves: 1. Not using the utensil for anything, 
including non-chametz, for twenty-four hours. This also applies to the 
(non-Pesach) pot in which the hagalah water will be boiled. 2. Submerging the 
utensil in boiling water that is over the fire. The water must be at a rolling 
boil before the utensil to be kashered is put into it, and the water must touch 
every surface of the utensil. Therefore, each item should be kashered 
individually, and the water should be allowed to return to a boil before the 
next item is placed into the pot. Large utensils may be submerged in the water 
one part at a time. 3. Removing the utensil from the water and rinsing it in 
cold water.</p> 
<p><b>Ovens</b></p> 
<p>Kashering a Self-Cleaning Oven: 1. Remove any visible pieces of food (or 
other items) from the oven; 2. Go through one complete self cleaning cycle with 
the racks in place.</p> 
<p>Kashering a Non-Self-Cleaning Oven: 1. Clean walls, floor, door, ceiling 
and racks thoroughly with an abrasive cleaner (for example, Easy-Off ) to 
remove tangible chametz. Pay special attention to the temperature gauge, the 
window in the door and the edges of the oven chamber. Black discolorations that 
are flush with the metal do not have to be removed. 2. Once the oven is clean, 
it is preferable that it remain unused for twenty- four hours. 3. Place the 
racks back into the oven, and turn the oven to broil for one and-a-half hours. 
4. Pesach food or pans may be placed directly on the door or racks once the 
oven has been kashered.</p> 
<p> If the oven has a separate broiler chamber, it should be kashered in the 
same manner as the oven chamber.</p> 
<p> A broiler pan that comes in direct contact with food cannot be kashered.
</p> 
<p>Note: The method of kashering described above is based on the ruling of Rav 
Aharon Kotler zt&rsquo;l. However, Rav Moshe ruled that the oven must either be 
kashered with a blowtorch, or that an insert should be placed into the oven for 
the duration of Pesach. Consult your own Rabbi for guidance.</p> 
<p><b>Stovetops</b></p> 
<p>The grates of a gas stovetop should be kashered in the oven chamber in the 
same manner described above. For an electric stovetop, just clean the coils and 
turn on high for ten minutes. If you have a glass-topped stovetop, you should 
consult your Rabbi for directions on if/how it can be used for Pesach.<br>
 For 
a gas or electric stove, it is preferable to replace the drip pans that are 
under the burners; if this isn&rsquo;t possible, the area should be covered 
with aluminum foil. The work area between the burners should be cleaned and 
covered with aluminum foil. The knobs and handles of the oven and stovetop 
should be wiped clean.</p> 
<p><b>Sinks</b></p> 
<p>Kashering a Stainless Steel Sink: 1. If the filter covering the drain has 
very fine holes, remove the filter and put it away for Pesach with the chametz 
dishes. If the holes are larger, the filter may be kashered with the sink. 2. 
Clean the sink, faucet and knobs, and don&rsquo;t use the sink for anything 
other than cold water for twenty-four hours. 3. Boil water up in one or more 
large pots (clean pots that have not been used for twenty-four hours). The pots 
may be chametz pots. 4. Dry the sink, then pour the boiling<br>
 water over 
every spot on the walls and floor of the sink and on the faucet. One may kasher 
part of the sink and then boil more water for the rest of the sink. Extreme 
care should be taken during this type of kashering to ensure that none of the 
boiling water splashes onto the person doing the kashering or others who are 
nearby. 5. Rinse the sink and faucet with cold water. 6. Put a new filter over 
the drain. One should also purchase new sponges and a fresh bottle of 
dishwashing liquid.</p> 
<p>Kashering a Porcelain Sink:<br>
 Since a porcelain sink cannot be kashered, 
one should kasher the faucet and knobs as outlined above and, for the duration 
of Pesach, place a basin (or insert) into the sink. All dishes, silverware, 
etc., should be washed in the basin, and wash-water can be disposed of through 
the sink&rsquo;s drain. One should be careful not to allow the sink to fill 
with hot water while the basin is in the sink.</p> 
<p><b>Microwave Oven</b></p> 
<p>Someone who wishes to use a year-round microwave on Passover should do the 
following.<br>
 &bull;The microwave should be cleaned out very well.<br>
 
&bull;A toothpick should be used to clean out the holes of the vent. If any 
particles splattered through the vent, they are likely too far away from the 
zeiya to pose an issue.<br>
 &bull;Liquid cleanser should be sprayed on all 
surfaces and washed off.<br>
 &bull;The turntable should be removed and 
replaced with new Kosher for Passover surface.<br>
 &bull;The microwave should 
be left idle for 24 hours.<br>
 &bull;A clean drinking glass, unused for 24 
hours, should be filled with water and boiled in the microwave for 10 minutes 
(Note: it might take several minutes for the water to begin to boil).<br>
 
&bull;The cup should be refilled and moved to another spot and the process 
repeated for 10 more minutes.<br>
 &bull;A piece of cardboard or contact paper 
should be taped over the glass window pane.<br>
 &bull;(If one does not kasher 
plastic for Passover, then all of the surfaces should be covered with cardboard 
or contact paper. Make sure to leave holes for the vents.)<br>
<br>
<b>
Dishwashers</b></p> 
<p>Dishwashers are often made from plastic and are subject to great 
discussion. However, if they are made from porcelain they cannot be kashered, 
while if they are made from stainless steel then they can be kashered. However, 
one should note that stainless steel dishwashers also contain synthetic 
components such as rubber gaskets and rubber tubing.</p> 
<p>Some individuals (or communities) wish to avoid leniencies, particularly in 
their Passover observance. Yet for others having use of their appliances on 
Passover is a basic essential. It is therefore recommended that these 
guidelines be discussed with one&rsquo;s Rabbi to see what method for kashering 
is appropriate given one&rsquo;s particular circumstances.</p> 
<p>If one wishes to use a non-porcelain year-round dishwasher on Passover, the 
following should be done:<br>
 &bull;If it is made of plastic or has synthetic 
gaskets, speak to your Rabbi as to whether it can be kashered for Passover.<br>

 &bull;Clean all surfaces using liquid cleanser.<br>
 &bull;Leave the 
dishwasher idle for 24 hours.<br>
 &bull;Run a heated cycle of the dishwasher 
with soap.<br>
 &bull;Boil large pots of water on stove and pour into the 
dishwasher<br>
 &bull;Add heated stones.<br>
 &bull;Run a heated dishwashing 
cycle.</p> 
<p><b>Refrigerators, Freezers, Food Shelves and Pantries</b></p> 
<p>These areas should be thoroughly cleaned&mdash;paying special attention to 
the edges where crumbs may get trapped&mdash;and the shelves lined with paper 
or plastic. The refrigerator and freezer will operate more efficiently if one 
pokes a few holes in the lining.</p> 
<p><b>Tablecloths, Kitchen Gloves, Aprons and Other Items Made of Fabric</b>
</p> 
<p>Any item made of fabric can be kashered by washing it in a washing machine 
set on &lsquo;hot&rsquo; and then checking to make sure that no pieces of food 
remain attached to it. Vinyl and plastic-lined tablecloths cannot be kashered.

<h1>Essential Information for Observing the Holiday</h1> 
<p>No other ceremony or ritual of the Jewish year is as beloved or is observed 
by so many as the Passover Seder. Yet celebrating Passover properly requires 
close familiarity with all the laws governing Passover foods, ownership of 
chametz, preparing the home, and so on.</p> 
<p>In this website, we have provided much of the basic information you will 
need. However, if you are unsure about any aspect at all of how to observe 
Passover, or how to make sure your home fully conforms to the Passover 
requirements, you should not hesitate to ask an Orthodox Rabbi for his guidance.

<h1>The OU symbol: A Mark of Trust</h1> 
<p>With an array of religious, youth, social action, educational, public 
policy and community development services, programs and activities, the 
Orthodox Union is among the largest Jewish organizations in the world. Its 
kosher supervision label, the OU, is the world&rsquo;s most recognized kosher 
symbol.</p> 
<p>Over 60% of kosher supervised foods in the USA carry the OU on their 
labels. That translates to more than 275,000 products from over 2,400 
manufacturers, produced in nearly 6,000 plants in 77 countries. Respected and 
trusted the world over, OU Kashrut makes it easy to shop for kosher products 
and to keep kosher at home and away.</p> 
<p>The OU symbol is a registered trademark in the U.S., Israel, Canada, and 
the European Union. It may only be used with written authorization of the 
Orthodox Union Kosher Division. This site includes a list of OU certified 
kosher products for use for Passover, 2005.</p> 
<p>Products appearing in this website are certified as kosher only when 
bearing the emblem on the label. It is recommended that consumers check the 
ingredient panel of products with no dairy designation to insure that the 
pareve status is accurate.</p> 
<p>Consumers should look for the P or Kosher for Passover symbols on all 
products. There are, however, some OU products which do not require special 
Passover supervision. These are so noted in the Pesach Online Database. Kosher 
for Passover stickers are generally not acceptable.</p> 
<p>This website does not deal with medicines or cosmetics. Personal products 
such as these also fall under the Passover laws and you should ask an Orthodox 
Rabbi which products may be permissible to be used, and which must be disposed 
of or sold.</p> 
<p>We encourage you to ask your local grocer or supermarket manager to stock 
those OU endorsed products that are not readily available in your area.</p> 
<p>Kosher updates appear regularly on our website, in our weekly Shabbat 
Shalom e-mail, and in Jewish Action, our quarterly family magazine.</p> Back to

<h1>Shiurim of Passover</h1> 
<p>By: Rabbi David Bistricer</p> 
<p><br>
 The Passover holiday is a time when we celebrate our rich heritage 
and affirm our commitment to the continuity of our traditions. The exodus from 
Egypt was the point in our great history when we were freed from bondage to 
man, and culminated with our becoming a nation of God with the subsequent 
acceptance of the Torah at Sinai. What has sustained us as a nation and 
preserved us throughout the millennia? The observance of Torah and mitzvot 
replete with their many details as required by religious law define our way of 
life and preserve our identity. During Passover, this notion expresses itself 
through required measurements of the special foods we eat during the holiday. 
These basic measurements and their careful observance are integral to our 
heritage. Indeed, the Talmud states that halachic measurements are a part of 
the unique laws that were given to Moshe Rabeinu at Sinai.<br>
 The general 
measurement of food items used in the performance of mitzvot is minimally a 
kezayit, the size of an olive by volume. Liquids are measured by revi&rsquo;it, 
an ancient measure equaling a few liquid ounces.<br>
<br>
<b>Kezayit Matzah</b>
<br> There are some variances amongst halachic authorities as far as how the 
precise measurement should be calculated,<b> but the minimally recommended size 
is approximately 26 cubic centimeters</b>.<br>
 Although strictly speaking, the 
Torah level mitzvah of matzah requires one to eat the measurement of a single 
kezayit, there is a rabbinic requirement to consume a total of five kezeitimat 
different intervals of the seder.<br>
 The first two portions are eaten 
together, one associated with the benediction of hamotzi with the other 
associated with the benediction of<i>al achilat matzah</i>. <br>
 The third 
kezayit is eaten as part of the traditional korech sandwich from the sage, 
Hillel, which serves as a reminder of the Beit Hamikdash. The fourth and fifth 
kezeitim are eaten together at the end of the festive meal as part of the 
Afikoman.<br>
 The fourth kezayit is associated with the korban Pesach, while 
the fifth kezayit is a reminder of the chagigah offering that was brought 
during the Three Festivals. Ideally, the required measurement for the 
additional four kezeitim should be the same as the basic mitzvah of 
matzahmentioned above. However, since these four kezeitimare rabbinic 
requirements, in an extenuating circumstance there is room for leniency to eat

<b>Kezayit Moror</b><br>
 Nowadays, with the absence of the Beit 
Hamikdash (Holy Temple), the korban Pesach (paschal lamb) is not brought and 
therefore its interdependent sister mitzvah, maror (bitter herb), is not a 
Torah-level precept, but is currently a rabbinic ordinance. This is because our 
Sages mandated that one must still eat the traditional bitter herb 
independently.<br>
 Therefore while the minimal amount of maror that one is 
required to consume at the seder is also a kezayit, there are some variances 
amongst halachic authorities as far as how this measurement should be 
calculated. Moreover, some authorities calculate the measurement diferently for 
mitzvot derabbanan.<br>
<b>The minimal size given is approximately 26 cubic 
centimeters, which can be limited to just a single, large leaf of romaine 
lettuce</b>. <br>
 Medium or small leaves of romaine lettuce will respectively 
amount to approximately three-fifths or one-fifth of the required amount. Large 
romaine stalks are approximately half a kezayit, while small romaine stalks are 
roughly one-quarter&rsquo;s worth. A single endive is between one half to one 
quarter of the required amount, depending upon whether the leaf is large, 
medium, or small. A filled one ounce shot glass of ground horseradish 
constitutes a kezayit.<br>
<br>
<b>Revi&rsquo;it Wine</b><br>
 The requirement 
of drinking four cups of wine is rabbinic in nature and the minimal measurement 
required for the four cups is a rivi&rsquo;it for each cup. There are some 
variances amongst halachic authorities as far as how this measurement should be 
calculated, but the<b>minimal size given is approximately three ounces </b>. It 
should be noted that if one&rsquo;s cup holds more than a rivi&rsquo;it, one 
should try to drink the entire cup or at least most of it.<br>

 Passover 
is a time when we became a nation and is therefore an opportunity to appreciate 
the many laws that were given to us. As we celebrate our freedom during the 
Passover holiday, we have the opportunity to reflect on what makes our heritage 
so unique. The meticulousness, care, and detail with which we approach ritual 
observance will certainly make our heritage special.</p> Back to OU Passover

<h1>Mechirat Chometz</h1> 
<p>By: Rabbi Dov Schreier</p> 
<p><b>How Mechirat Chametz, Selling Your Chametz, Works</b><br>
 It may come 
as a surprise to many that the sale of chametz, one of Pesach&rsquo;s 
traditional rituals, is actually a relatively recent innovation. In order to 
avoid the prohibition of Jewish ownership during the holiday, the Mishna 
proposes the solution of selling chametz to a non-Jew. However, this selling 
process was very different from the one we practice today. Unlike our current 
practice, the Mishna refers to a final and irrevocable sale through which the 
original owner transfers his chametz into the hands of the non-Jew and then 
abandons any connection to it.</p> 
<p>During the middle ages, Eastern European land laws forbade Jewish 
participation in the agricultural economies of many of the countries in which 
they resided. Consequently, many Jews chose such independent trades as the 
operation of taverns. These taverns manufactured and sold grain-based liquor. 
With their livelihoods invested in liquor inventories, Pesach threatened to 
wipe out the source of income of Jewish tavern keepers.</p> 
<p>Rabbi Yoel Sirkis (Bach, 1560-1640) addressed this problem by permitting 
the sale of liquor without removing it from its premises, accomplished by 
renting the storage space to the non-Jew along with the sale of the chametz. 
Even though the sale would be reversed after Pesach, the Bach held that it was 
nonetheless an effective and legal sale.</p> 
<p>Some have argued that the process of selling chametz should only be done in 
a situation that involves a great loss, for example when a business would be 
forced to discard its chametz inventory. Chametz for personal use, they say, 
should be completely discarded in observance of the mitzvah of &ldquo;tashbitu 
se&rsquo;or mibateichem.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><b>The Rabbi as Agent</b></p> 
<p>Contrary to a widespread misconception, Rabbis do not buy the chametz. The 
individual participating in the sale appoints his Rabbi as an agent to sell his 
chametz to a non-Jew on Erev Pesach. The signature on the contract and the 
exchange of an object (e.g., a handkerchief) in a procedure known as a kinyan 
chalifin, formalizes the power of attorney.</p> 
<p><b>The Sale </b></p> 
<p>To overcome any possible doubts associated with the validity of the 
transaction, different methods of halachic acquisition are also employed:</p> 
<p>1) Kinyan Kesef: An actual transfer of money in the form of a down payment 
is tendered by the purchasing non-Jew.<br>
 2) Kinyan Shtar: The transaction is 
recorded in a legal contract signed by the parties.<br>
 3) Kinyan Chalifin: An 
exchange (barter) of property, whereby the non-Jew hands over an object of his, 
upon which the chametz is transferred into his ownership.<br>
 4) Kinyan 
Chatzer: The non-Jew acquires real estate from the Jew. By dint of the real 
estate acquisition, the chametz transfers as well.<br>
 5) Tekiat Kaf and 
Kinyan Odita: A handshake and verbal affirmation signaling the completion of 
the transaction.</p> 
<p>Due to these intricacies, the sale often takes place in the presence of a 
Bet Din of three or more rabbanim.</p> 
<p>Many Rabbis request that their congregants list all the chametz they have, 
where it is stored, and its approximate total value. Others limit their 
congregations to selling only mixtures of chametz (e.g., dressings with flour, 
mayonnaise with vinegar that may be chametz, as well as liquors), and not pure 
chametz such as breads, pastas, cakes, and cereals. All of this is done in 
order to stress the serious nature of the process.</p> 
<p>To accommodate individuals who plan to be away the entire Yom Tov, some 
Rabbis either hold a key to their home during the holiday, or the individual 
designates someone else to hold the key, to insure the non-Jewish purchaser 
access to his chametz.</p> 
<p>The transaction takes place on Erev Pesach, which falls this year on Monday 
morning, March 29, 2010, prior to the conclusion of the fifth halachic hour of 
the day.</p> 
<p><b>Selling Chametz in Different Time Zones </b></p> 
<p>This process works smoothly when each person and their chametz remain in 
the same time zone. However, what happens if the chametz is in America, but its 
initial owner will be in Israel for Pesach? When the Rabbi is selling the 
chametz in the US time zone, Yom Tov will have already begun in Israel, past 
the time that one is permitted to have chametz in one&rsquo;s possession. If a 
person travels before Pesach, the Rabbis arrange an early sale, to take effect 
Sunday evening, March 28, 2010. Even with Israel being six or seven hours 
ahead, this is still prior to the prohibition of owning chametz. (For those who 
plan to be away the entire Pesach and want to avoid having to search for the 
chametz, selling the chametz at this time may obviate the necessity for 
searching for the chametz. Consult your Rabbi for details.)</p> 
<p>What about the final day of Pesach, when the Yom Tov concludes at 8:25 p.m. 
in the New York area and the person visiting California is still in the final 
day of Pesach? In this instance, the Rabbi stipulates at the time of the sale 
that he will only reacquire the chametz after Pesach ends for that individual.
</p> 
<p><b>The OU&rsquo;s Jewish-Owned Companies</b></p> 
<p>How does the OU handle the sale of chametz in Jewish-owned kosher-certified 
manufacturers and production plants?</p> 
<p>The first rule &ndash; a Jewish-owned company may not operate on Pesach 
with any chametz. The OU runs a computer report around Chanukah each year of 
all these companies. A note is then sent to the Rabbinic Coordinator who is 
responsible for that plant reminding him to alert the company to sell all its 
chametz and refrain from operation on Pesach. Obviously, there are many 
companies under OU supervision that are not owned by Jews and are not 
restricted from operating on Pesach.</p> 
<p>A shtar, power of attorney document, is signed authorizing Rabbi Yaakov 
Luban (OU Executive Rabbinic Coordinator) to act as each company&rsquo;s agent 
to sell its chametz. The list is meticulously maintained, to ensure that all 
the companies have properly sold their chametz. Rabbi Luban also conducts the 
sale on Sunday night for those companies that are east of New York or whose 
principal owner will be east of New York for Pesach. Rabbi Luban stipulates 
that for those in time zones where Pesach ends earlier, the non-Jew gives 
permission to use the chametz and recalculate the amounts after Pesach. The 
same stipulation is made for those companies west of New York; Rabbi Luban 
acquires the chametz prior to Pesach in New York and the owner does not take 
possession until after Pesach ends for him.</p> 
<p>With the multitude of Jewish-owned companies under OU supervision, 
preparing for Pesach poses a monumental task. But we are fully confident that 
with the proper team work, foresight and careful arrangements, all of our 
companies and consumers can enjoy a &ldquo;chag kasher v&rsquo;sameach.&rdquo;

<h1>Gebrokts &ndash; Not Just a Half-Baked Idea</h1> 
<p>By: Rabbi Nachum Rabinowitz</p> 
<p>People are noticing that matzah meal, a longtime Pesach-baking staple, is 
appearing less and less in pre-packaged kosher-for-Passover products, usually 
substituted with potato starch.</p> 
<p>Why is matzah meal vanishing from much of our Passover-baking fare?</p> 
<p>True, wheat (gluten)-free products have certainly increased in popularity, 
but this alone does not appear to be the motivation for the change. It is 
primarily due to the hundreds-year-old stringency (chumra) of avoiding gebrokts 
(broken matzah, as in matzah meal) adopted in certain communities (particularly 
amongst Hasidim) that forbids the mixture of matzah with water over the Pesach 
holiday. Hence, a batter containing matzah meal and any liquid is avoided by 
the non-gebrokts adherents during Passover. Based on what is available on the 
Pesach supermarket shelves, the non-gebrokts-adherents are commanding an 
increasing market share.</p> 
<p>Halacha and Gebrokts</p> 
<p>The halacha, as formulated in the Gemara and Shulchan Aruch, clearly states 
that once matzah is baked, it can no longer become chametz and is permitted in 
any dish. The majority of Klal Yisrael conducts themselves accordingly &ndash; 
preparing matzah balls, matzah brei and a variety of baked goods containing 
matzah meal.</p> 
<p>Nonetheless, some poskim raised the concern that in the haste to knead the 
dough within the eighteen-minute limit, some of the flour may not be fully 
mixed with the water and does not become matzah. Though this flour is baked, 
there is concern that if subjected to water afterwards, the chametz (leavening) 
process will then commence.</p> 
<p>There are varying parameters applied to this stringency; some individuals 
are careful to avoid even the utensils that were used to prepare gebrokts 
dishes, while others are not. And some avoid mixing matzah with any liquid, 
while others are only careful to segregate Matzo from water.</p> 
<p>Interestingly, one posek even voiced opposition to the minhag, arguing that 
the limitations imposed by its adherence would place unnecessary limitations on 
Pesach menus, thereby diminishing the enjoyment of the Yom Tov.</p> 
<p>It is important to note that even those who keep this custom are careful to 
emphasize that it is only a stringency, and not a halachically-mandated 
requirement. For this reason, Hasidim and others following this minhag often 
partake of gebrokts on the eighth day of Pesach*, so as to symbolically join 
their brethren who have not adopted the chumra.</p> 
<p>Whatever your minhag, may you enjoy all your kosher-for-Pesach cakes and 
eat them too!</p> 
<p>*even though it is a Yom Tov day, it is rabbinically mandated and not 
biblically.</p> Back to OU Passover Home Page Print Article

<h1>The Chef&rsquo;s Table- Healthy Passover Pleasures</h1> 
<p>By: Norene Gilletz</p> 
<p>Most traditional Pesach recipes are high in calories, carbohydrates and 
fat, but are low in fiber. Traditions are hard to break and favorite foods are 
difficult to &ldquo;pass up,&rdquo; especially during a holiday. To help you 
eat well even during Pesach, here are some healthy and delicious recipes that 
are sure to please the guests at your table. I&rsquo;ve also included some 
helpful tips to make your Pesach preparations easier. Enjoy without guilt!</p> 
<p>Plan Ahead: Each year, go through your favorite recipes. Photocopy those 
that are &ldquo;keepers,&rdquo; and note any necessary adjustments. Similarly, 
keep your menus and grocery lists from previous years as a helpful guide and 
store them in clear plastic page protectors. That way, you&rsquo;ll be 
organized for Pesach and will know what to buy for the current year. 
Don&rsquo;t be afraid to try new recipes, but it&rsquo;s a good idea to try 
them ahead of the Seders to ensure that your family will like them.</p> 
<p>Shop Smart: Fill your grocery cart with fresh fruits and vegetables, lean 
meats, poultry, fish and low-fat dairy products. Beware of processed foods, as 
they are often loaded with fat, carbs and sodium. Don&rsquo;t shop when you are 
hungry&mdash;you&rsquo;ll buy too much junk food.</p> 
<p>Boost the Fiber: Choose whole wheat matzah whenever possible. Whole wheat 
matzah contains three to four grams of fiber per sheet, whereas plain matzah 
contains only one gram. To get additional fiber, eat lots of fresh fruits and 
vegetables.</p> 
<p>Portion Distortion: You don&rsquo;t need to eat everything on the table! 
Eat slowly&mdash;it takes twenty minutes for your brain to know when the 
stomach is full.</p> 
<p>Know What to Eat: Choose lower-fat dishes when possible&mdash;chicken, 
turkey and fish are leaner protein choices than meat. Also, soups, salads and 
vegetable dishes are healthier options than traditional starchy Pesach dishes.
</p> 
<p>Leftover Wine: Refrigerate leftover wine or freeze it in ice cube trays, 
storing the cubes in resealable freezer bags. These cubes can later be added to 
various recipes; wine adds flavor to meat, poultry and sauces.</p> 
<p>Dessert Dilemma: Focus on fruit for dessert. Most fruits are low in 
calories, and they also have a low glycemic index (GI). Berries are best. When 
choosing a high GI dessert, top it with fruit to bring the glycemic index down 
to a more moderate level. It&rsquo;s okay to indulge, but keep your portions 
small! A little bit of chocolate also goes a long way.</p> 
<p>Miniature &ldquo;Notsa&rdquo; Balls (Chicken Kneidlach)<br>
 Makes 2 dozen 
miniature balls</p> 
<p>These low-carb chicken kneidlach are a luscious alternative to regular 
matzah balls. You can also substitute ground almonds for matzah meal, which 
makes the balls gluten free. Make your favorite recipe for chicken soup or 
vegetarian broth and serve it with these delicious, guilt-free kneidlach.</p> 
<p>1 medium onion, cut into chunks<br>
 1 celery stalk, cut into chunks<br>
 2 
tablespoons fresh dill<br>
 1 pound lean ground chicken or turkey<br>
 1 large 
egg<br>
 1 tablespoon vegetable or olive oil<br>
 3 tablespoons matzah meal (or 
ground almonds)<br>
 1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
 Freshly ground black pepper<br>
 2 
tablespoons club soda or cold water<br>
 10 cups salted water</p> 
<p>Using the steel blade of a food processor, process the onion, celery and 
dill until minced, about 10 seconds. Add the ground chicken, egg, oil, matzah 
meal (or almonds), salt, pepper and club soda; process just until mixed. 
Transfer to a bowl, cover and chill for 20 to 30 minutes.<br>
 In a large pot, 
bring the salted water to a boil. Wet your hands and shape the mixture into 
walnut-sized balls. Drop balls into the boiling water, cover tightly and simmer 
for 20 to 25 minutes or until cooked through. Don&rsquo;t peek! Using a slotted 
spoon, carefully remove the balls from the water and transfer to bowls of hot 
chicken soup or vegetable broth.</p> 
<p>Note: These &ldquo;notsa&rdquo; balls keep for up to 2 days in the 
refrigerator, and they reheat well. They also freeze well for up to 3 months.

 With 
ground almonds, each ball contains 40 calories, 0.7 gram carbohydrate, and 2.6

 Chef&rsquo;s Secrets:<br>
 Hidden Treasure: Stuff the notsa 
balls with any of the following: shredded carrots, finely minced parsley, 
cooked chopped spinach, saut&eacute;ed chopped mushrooms or onions. To stuff, 
poke a hole with your finger in the center of each ball. Close the opening and 
re-roll the balls so that the filling is hidden.<br>
 Frozen Assets: 
&ldquo;Notsa&rdquo; balls can be cooked in advance, then frozen in chicken 
soup. Alternatively, cook them in a single layer on a cookie sheet or in muffin 
pans until firm, then transfer to plastic freezer bags and freeze until needed. 
There&rsquo;s no need to thaw first&mdash;just reheat them directly in the 
simmering soup! They will take about 10 minutes to defrost.<br>
 Grind It 
Right: Ground chicken usually contains dark meat, which increases the fat 
content. Ask your butcher to grind skinless, trimmed chicken breasts. Or, you 
can grind the chicken breasts yourself in a food processor. Cut 1 pound chilled 
boneless, skinless chicken breasts into 1-inch chunks and process 15 to 20 
seconds until minced.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Notsa&rdquo; Balls<br>
 from a Mix<br>
 Makes 3 dozen miniature balls
</p> 
<p>This tasty, low-carb recipe uses a packet of matzah ball mix. Serve the 
&ldquo;notsa&rdquo; balls in chicken soup or as a side dish. They also taste 
terrific when reheated in the defatted pan juices from brisket or roast chicken.
</p> 
<p>1 pound lean ground chicken<br>
 2 large eggs (or 1 large egg plus 2 egg 
whites)<br>
 1 tablespoon oil<br>
 3 tablespoons club soda or cold water<br>
 1 
tablespoon minced fresh dill<br>
 1 packet matzah ball mix (or gluten-free 
matzah ball mix)<br>
 10 cups salted water</p> 
<p>In a large bowl, combine the ground chicken with the eggs, oil, club soda, 
dill and matzah ball mix; combine well. Cover and chill for 20 to 30 minutes.
<br> In a large pot, bring the salted water to a boil. Wet your hands and shape 
the mixture into walnut-sized balls. Drop into the boiling water, cover tightly 
and simmer for 40 to 45 minutes or until cooked through. Don&rsquo;t peek! 
Using a slotted spoon, carefully remove the balls from the water and transfer 
to bowls of hot chicken soup or vegetable broth.</p>

<p>Honey &lsquo;N Herb Turkey Breast<br>
 10 servings</p> 
<p>Everyone at your table will gobble this up! Mango juice adds a marvelous 
flavor to the turkey, but orange juice will also add its own special twist.</p> 
<p>3 onions, thinly sliced<br>
 1 red pepper, seeded and sliced<br>
 1 
boneless rolled turkey breast (about 4 pounds)<br>
 Salt <br>
 Freshly ground 
black pepper<br>
 Paprika<br>
 1 cup mango or orange juice</p> 
<p>Marinade:<br>
 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil<br>
 2 tablespoons 
lemon juice (preferably fresh)<br>
 2 cloves garlic (about 2 teaspoons minced)
<br> 2-3 tablespoons honey<br>
 1/2 teaspoon dried basil<br>
 1/2 teaspoon 
dried thyme</p> 
<p>Spray a roasting pan with cooking spray. Place the onions and red pepper in 
the bottom of the pan. Rinse the turkey breast and pat dry. Place the turkey on 
top of the vegetables; season with salt, pepper and paprika.<br>
 In a small 
bowl, combine the marinade ingredients; mix well.<br>
 Drizzle the turkey and 
vegetables with the marinade, coating the turkey on all sides. Drizzle the 
mango juice over and around the turkey. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour or up 
to 2 days, basting occasionally. Remove from the refrigerator about 30 minutes 
before cooking.<br>
 Preheat the oven to 350&deg;. Roast the turkey, covered, 
for about 2 hours (about 25 to 30 minutes per pound). Uncover the turkey for 
the last 30 minutes of cooking; baste occasionally. When done, the juices will 
run clear when pierced with a fork, and a meat thermometer, when inserted into 
the thickest part of the bird, should register an internal temperature of 165 
to 170&deg;.<br>
 When the turkey is cooked, remove the pan from the oven, 
cover and let stand for 20 minutes before thinly slicing. Serve with the pan 
juices.</p> 
<p>Note: The turkey will keep for 2 to 3 days in the refrigerator, and it 
reheats well. It also freezes well for up to 4 months.</p>

<p>Chef&rsquo;s Secrets:<br>
 Be Prepared: Prepare and cook the turkey breast 
as directed. Thinly slice and place in a casserole dish; top with pan juices. 
Refrigerate for 1 to 2 days. Reheat, covered for 20 minutes at 350&deg;.</p> 
<p>No Bones About It: If a rolled turkey breast isn&rsquo;t available, use an 
unrolled turkey breast, allowing 20 to 25 minutes cooking per pound. If you 
can&rsquo;t find one large turkey breast, use 2 smaller ones. Use an 
instant-read thermometer to prevent overcooking.</p> 
<p>Pesach Vegetable Muffins<br>
 Makes 10 muffins</p> 
<p>Vegetarian heaven! These colorful veggie muffins make an excellent side 
dish or are perfect as a healthy snack. I like to throw in some garlic, red 
pepper and fresh dill to add color and boost the flavor. A food processor helps 
to speed up the preparation and is well worth the investment.</p> 
<p>2 tablespoons olive oil<br>
 1 medium onion, chopped<br>
 1 clove garlic 
(about 1 teaspoon minced)<br>
 1/2 red or green pepper, seeded and chopped<br>
 
1 celery stalk, chopped<br>
 1 1/2 cups grated carrots<br>
 1 cup grated 
zucchini, well-drained (about 1 small zucchini)<br>
 3 large eggs, lightly 
beaten<br>
 3/4 teaspoon salt<br>
 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br>

 3/4 cup matzah meal<br>
 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill (or 1 teaspoon dried)
</p> 
<p>Preheat the oven to 375&deg;. Spray 10 compartments of a muffin pan with 
cooking spray and fill 2 compartments with water.<br>
 Heat the oil in a large 
nonstick skillet on medium high heat. Saut&eacute; the onion and garlic in hot 
oil for 5 minutes or until golden. Add the pepper, celery, carrots and 
zucchini. Reduce heat to medium and saut&eacute; for 5 to 7 minutes longer, 
until tender, stirring occasionally. Let cool.<br>
 Stir in the eggs, salt, 
pepper and matzah meal; mix well. Scoop the batter into the compartments of the 
muffin pan. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until golden brown. Cool slightly, 
then carefully remove from pan.</p> 
<p>Note: This recipe easily doubles and triples. The muffins keep for 3 to 4 
days in the refrigerator and reheat well. They also freeze well for up to 2 
months.</p> 
<p>Nutrition Info: 100 calories per muffin, 11.6 grams carbohydrate, 0.8 gram

rolls on a baking sheet and bake at 375&deg; for about 45 minutes. Unwrap and 
cut into 1/2-inch slices.</p> 
<p>Variations: <br>
 Try using parsnips, broccoli or an herb such as basil or 
parsley instead of carrots, zucchini or dill.</p> 
<p>Chocolate Almond Apricot Clusters<br>
 Makes 48 clusters</p> 
<p>These chocolates are so good, you&rsquo;ll pray they last until the end of 
Pesach! Chocolate lifts your spirits when you&rsquo;re feeling tired and 
overwhelmed with Pesach preparations, and these no-bake treats are the perfect 
&ldquo;pick-me-up.&rdquo; They are also a wonderful and easy gift to bring to a 
Seder. Everyone will &ldquo;cluster&rdquo; around you when you bring these to 
the table!</p> 
<p>10 ounces good-quality dark chocolate<br>
 (bittersweet or semi-sweet)<br>
 
1 tablespoon vegetable oil<br>
 2 cups toasted almonds, sliced or slivered<br>
 
1 1/2 cups dried apricots, cut up</p> 
<p>Break the chocolate into chunks and place in a large, dry microwaveable 
bowl. Microwave on medium, uncovered, for 2 minutes, then stir. Continue 
microwaving on medium for 1 to 2 minutes longer until the chocolate is just 
melted; stir well. Cool slightly before stirring in oil, almonds and apricots.
<br> Drop the mixture by teaspoonfuls onto baking sheets lined with parchment 
paper. Refrigerate for 30 to 45 minutes or until firm. Transfer clusters to an 
airtight container, separating the layers with parchment or waxed paper.</p> 
<p>Note: The best way to cut the apricots is to use scissors. The clusters 
keep for 2 to 3 weeks in the refrigerator&mdash;if you hide them well! They 
also freeze well for up to 4 months.</p>

<h1>Chametz Sheavar Alav haPesach: The Supermarket Controversy</h1> 
<p>By: Rabbi Yaakov Luban</p> 
<p>An exciting aspect of Torah study is the application of the age-old 
principles of halachah to the modern world in which we live. Thus, as an 
example, there is obviously no Talmudic discussion about the propriety of 
walking past a motion detector on Shabbat, yet contemporary posekim (halachic 
decisors) have analyzed this issue and found relevant source material in the 
vast sea of halachic literature. By identifying fundamental principles and 
concepts, halachists have addressed she&rsquo;eilot (questions) that run the 
full gamut of modern human experience.</p> 
<p>A fascinating case in point is the issue of purchasing chametz (fermented 
wheat, spelt, oat, rye and barley) after Pesach in a Jewish-owned supermarket. 
There were no ShopRites in fourth-century Babylonia when the Talmud was 
redacted, but, nonetheless, treatment of this matter touches on numerous areas 
of halachic thought. One could easily compose an entire volume on this topic 
alone. This article will but scratch the surface and present some of the broad 
issues of concern.</p> 
<p><b>Q. What is &ldquo;chametz sheavar alav haPesach&rdquo;? </b></p> 
<p>A. The Torah prohibitions against chametz are unique, in that a Jew is not 
only prohibited from consuming and deriving benefit from chametz during Pesach, 
but he is even restricted in owning it because of the injunction of 
&ldquo;ba&rsquo;al yairo&rsquo;eh uba&rsquo;al yimotze&rdquo; (literally, 
chametz &ldquo;may not be seen or found,&rdquo; but the Sages interpreted this 
to mean that ownership of chametz is prohibited). In addition, the rabbis of 
the Talmud established an after-the-fact penalty for owning chametz products 
during Pesach, in violation of halachah. Such items, known as &ldquo;chametz 
sheavar alav haPesach,&rdquo; may not be consumed, nor may one derive benefit 
from them. This means that if you neglected to sell your box of Raisin Bran 
before Pesach, you may not consume it or derive benefit from it even after 
Pesach. (In fact, if one accidentally purchased chametz sheavar alav haPesach, 
the item may not be returned for a refund, as this would constitute derivation 
of benefit.) While some posit that only the owner is penalized for chametz 
sheavar alav haPesach, in practice we follow the viewpoint that its 
restrictions are universal and apply to everyone. (Perhaps this serves as a 
deterrent against hoarding chametz in order to sell it after Pesach.) As a 
result, one may not purchase chametz from a Jewish-owned store or supermarket 
after Pesach if the owner continued to own and purchase chametz during the 
holiday.</p> 
<p><b>Q. What if the store is jointly owned by a Jew and non-Jew? What is the 
status of the chametz in this instance?</b></p> 
<p>A. There is an opinion that if the non-Jewish partner owns a majority of 
the business, there is no concern of chametz sheavar alav haPesach (Shu&rdquo;t 
Zecher Yitzchak, responsa 8). Nonetheless, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein (1895-1986; 
Iggerot Moshe, EH 1:7) adds one important caveat: If the Jewish partner is the 
manager of the company, the enterprise is treated as a Jewish business, even 
though the partner owns less than 50 percent of the company.</p> 
<p><b>Q. How do I know which stores are Jewish owned and do not sell their 
chametz? I may know who owns the small local grocery store around the corner, 
but how would I know if the owner or manager of a large chain is Jewish? True, 
I can search the Internet and perhaps discover the owner&rsquo;s name, but how 
would I know if he is really Jewish? Even if the owner has a Jewish-sounding 
name, there is no guarantee that he is Jewish. It is an unfortunate reality 
today that his mother may have been non-Jewish, which renders him halachically 
not Jewish.</b></p> 
<p>A. There are private lists available that circulate around Pesach time with 
basic information, but it is best to check with your local rabbi. If he is in 
doubt, he can call the Orthodox Union (OU) or another major kashrut 
organization that has access to this information.</p> 
<p><b>Q. What items are included in this prohibition? </b></p> 
<p>A. Bread, cookies, cake, pretzels, blintzes, cereals and other foods that 
contain any of the five primary grains (oat, wheat, spelt, rye and barley) are 
included. Interestingly, even flour is problematic because wheat is tempered in 
water before milling, and flour has the status of chametz. Whiskey, beer and 
other alcoholic beverages distilled from grain also pose the same concern.</p> 
<p><b>Q. Does chametz sheavar alav haPesach apply to kitniyot? </b></p> 
<p>A. Jews of Ashkenazic descent refrain from eating kitniyot (legumes, such 
as corn, rice, beans, et cetera) during Pesach. However, this is a tradition 
that evolved in the last millennium, and these foods are not actual chametz. As 
such, chametz sheavar alav haPesach does not apply to kitniyot, and these items 
may be purchased in any supermarket after Pesach.</p> 
<p><b>Q. Do products that contain vinegar (such as salad dressing, pickles and 
ketchup) fall under the prohibition of chametz sheavar alav haPesach?</b></p> 
<p>A. Surprisingly, the answer is the classical rabbinic response: &ldquo;It 
depends.&rdquo; Vinegar is manufactured from fermented alcohol, and there are 
various sources of alcohol. In the United States, most vinegar and alcohol is 
corn-derived (corn is kitniyot), and chametz sheavar alav haPesach does not 
apply. In contrast, in Europe, the majority of alcohol is derived from barley. 
As such, vinegar-based products in Europe are a problem.</p> 
<p><b>Q. How long must one wait before buying chametz from a Jewish-owned 
supermarket after Pesach?</b></p> 
<p>A. When I was a child, it was customary to wait until Shavuot, which is six 
weeks after the conclusion of Pesach. This date was a &ldquo;guesstimate&rdquo; 
of how long it would take for the stock of chametz that had been in the store 
during Pesach to be depleted. Today, it is generally assumed that the inventory 
in a major supermarket is sold much more quickly; shelves are generally 
restocked on a daily basis. Still, supermarket chains maintain large 
inventories of products in warehouses for distribution in individual stores, 
and it is necessary to calculate the turn-around time from the warehouse 
delivery until the purchase by the customer in the actual store.</p> 
<p>Rav Moshe writes (Iggerot Moshe, OC 4:96) that it is permissible to 
purchase chametz from a supermarket at the point in time when there is a 50 
percent possibility that the supermarket purchased the chametz after Pesach. 
Since chametz sheavar alav haPesach is a rabbinic (and not a Biblical) 
injunction, one can rely on a principle known as &ldquo;safek derabbanan 
lekula&rdquo; (one can be lenient when it is uncertain if a rabbinic 
restriction applies), and therefore shop freely in the store.</p> 
<p>The question is, When can one legitimately say there is a 50 percent chance 
that the chametz on the supermarket shelf was purchased by the store after the 
conclusion of Pesach? How long does it take to establish a reasonable doubt? It 
is difficult to give a precise cut-off date. Communal rabbis generally tell 
their congregants when they feel comfortable purchasing chametz, and my 
impression is that Lag B&rsquo;Omer (which is twenty-five days after the 
conclusion of Pesach) is a safe time.</p> 
<p><b>Q. Why can&rsquo;t rabbis sell the chametz of Jewish-owned supermarkets 
before Pesach? Most of us, via our rabbis, sell our chametz to a non-Jew (in a 
process known as &ldquo;mechirat chametz&rdquo;) to avoid the prohibition of 
owning chametz during the holiday. Since we do not legally own the chametz 
during Pesach, it can be consumed afterwards, when the rabbi purchases the 
chametz back. Why not do the same on a grand scale for supermarkets as well? We 
could then safely purchase chametz from the store as soon as yom tov concludes.
</b></p> 
<p>A. Indeed, this is exactly what takes place. In fact, some rabbis arrange 
to sell not only individual stores but also entire supermarket chains. However, 
this process is not without controversy, as it appears on the surface to be 
nothing more than a subterfuge. After all, some supermarkets are open on 
Pesach, conducting business as usual, buying and selling chametz. Doesn&rsquo;t 
this demonstrate that the sale of chametz is performed without sincerity? This 
argument is not new. Rabbi Chaim Chizkiyahu Medini (1832-1904) writes in his 
encyclopedic work, the Sdei Chemed, that a storeowner in his city closed his 
shop for Pesach and arranged for the sale of his chametz to a non-Jew. During 
Chol Hamoed, it was discovered that the store was secretly engaged in selling 
the chametz to non-Jewish customers. Rabbi Medini viewed this as a clear 
indication that the storeowner was not serious about the original sale. He 
publically forbade the community to purchase chametz from this store (as he 
considered it chametz sheavar alav haPesach), even though it resulted in 
enormous losses for the storeowner.</p> 
<p><b>Q. Why is mechirat chametz an accepted practice when it appears to be no 
more than a legal charade?</b></p> 
<p>A. The arguments cited above against selling supermarkets to non-Jews for 
Pesach lead us to fundamental questions about the propriety of the general sale 
of chametz as well. To highlight this point, consider the following: For the 
past twenty years, I have had the unique honor of arranging the sale of chametz 
for all Jewish-owned companies that are certified by the OU. It has often 
occurred to me that the total value of this chametz amounts to hundreds of 
millions of dollars. Every year I meet with an accommodating non-Jew who 
graciously purchases this chametz for a down payment of ten dollars. I explain 
to him that the balance of payment is not due until after Pesach. If one year I 
decide to not repurchase the chametz, this kind-hearted purchaser would have to 
come up with an astronomical sum that would be way beyond his means. Most 
rabbis don&rsquo;t engage in million-dollar sales, but the chametz they sell on 
behalf of their congregants may easily be worth tens of thousands of dollars. 
How can these sales be valid when the buyers lack the financial resources to 
pay for the goods?</p> 
<p>This very same argument was made almost three hundred years ago by Rabbi 
Alexander Sender Schor (1650-1733) (Bichor Shor, Pesachim 21a). The sale of 
large quantities of chametz became prevalent a few hundred years ago as Jews 
began to invest heavily in the liquor industry, and the disposal of chametz 
before Pesach would have resulted in very substantial losses. Rabbi Schor asks, 
&ldquo;How can the sale be valid when the purchaser is a man of very limited 
means who never purchased anything of significant value in his lifetime?&rdquo; 
Though Rabbi Schor offers a halachic response to this question, many rabbanim 
objected to mechirat chametz on these grounds, and the matter remained 
controversial. In fact, many people do not sell chametz be&rsquo;ain (visible 
chametz), and will only rely on mechirat chametz for mixtures of chametz. (For 
example, licorice and many corn-based cereals contain wheat flour as a minor 
ingredient. The halachah is less strict with regard to such chametz, since it 
is not &ldquo;visible.&rdquo;) A full analysis of this topic is beyond the 
scope of this article, but the lenient position has generally prevailed. 
Mechirat chametz has become a fixture of Jewish life, and most people sell all 
kinds of chametz. For our purposes, suffice it to say that mechirat chametz is 
valid because the sellers, who are unable to own chametz, clearly want to 
unburden themselves of these forbidden wares, and the purchaser is told that 
the sale is legally binding. In theory, the buyer could acquire the necessary 
capital to pay the balance due after Pesach by selling the chametz that he has 
acquired.</p> 
<p><b>Q. Why is mechirat chametz for a supermarket that continues to sell 
chametz during Pesach a valid sale?</b></p> 
<p>A. Good question. Many posekim fundamentally oppose the sale of 
Jewish-owned businesses that sell chametz on Pesach. In stark contrast to the 
mechirat chametz of a halachically observant Jew, the sale of a supermarket 
that is fully open for business on Pesach lacks the aura of respectability. The 
seller is clearly not sincere about the sale. For this reason, Rabbi Joseph B. 
Soloveitchik (1903-1993) and others considered sales involving supermarkets 
that sell chametz to customers on Pesach to have no validity. Nonetheless, Rav 
Moshe (Iggerot Moshe, OC 1:149, 2:91 and 4:95) was the champion of this 
transaction. He put forward various arguments of justification, one of which is 
that halachah does not take into consideration private thoughts (devarim 
shebelev) that are not verifiable. Furthermore, it is conceivable that the 
storeowner prefers to transfer ownership of his chametz to a non-Jew so his 
religious customers can shop freely in his establishment after Pesach, even 
though he intends to continue selling chametz merchandise during Pesach.<br>
 
The OU follows the more stringent position of Rabbi Soloveitchik.</p> 
<p><b>Q. How does the OU certify Jewish-owned businesses that manufacture 
chametz? How are manufacturers different than supermarkets?</b></p> 
<p>A. OU companies that are Jewish owned are not permitted to manufacture or 
distribute chametz during Pesach. When the OU enters into a new contract with a 
Jewish company, we make this policy clear at the outset.</p> 
<p>Very well then. You will rely on Rav Moshe. You will check with your rabbi 
and identify a supermarket that has sold its chametz. Immediately after Pesach, 
you will rush out and buy fresh Danishes to enjoy with your coffee after an 
entire week of cake-deprivation and eating cookies made from potato starch. Not 
so fast! Not all the problems have been resolved.</p> 
<p><b>Q. Isn&rsquo;t there a problem concerning chametz purchased by the 
supermarkets during Pesach itself? According to halachah, one cannot sell davar 
shelo ba le&rsquo;olam (goods which are not currently in one&rsquo;s 
possession), even if the transaction will not take effect until such time that 
one acquires the materials. It follows then that a rabbi can only sell the 
chametz owned by a supermarket before Pesach to a non-Jew, but cannot do so for 
the chametz that is acquired during Pesach. Once Pesach is over and you are 
grocery shopping, it is likely that much of the chametz you see on the shelves 
had been purchased by the supermarket on Pesach. Seems like the dream of fresh 
Danish and coffee has just gone up in smoke.</b></p> 
<p>A. Rabbi Pinchas M. Teitz (1908-1995), the rabbi of Elizabeth, New Jersey, 
for many years, took the initiative to arrange the sale of chametz for a number 
of large supermarket chains. About twenty-five years ago, I asked Rabbi Teitz 
why the sale was effective when the stores continued to acquire chametz on 
Pesach. Rabbi Teitz, who was a great talmid chacham, explained to me why he 
felt it was halachically possible to sell the chametz acquired on Pesach as 
well. Rabbis who sell supermarket chains follow this position. Nonetheless, a 
careful reading of the Iggeret Moshe (OC 4:96) makes it clear that Rav Moshe 
had a conflicting opinion and did not consider it possible to sell the chametz 
acquired by supermarkets during Pesach. In fact, this is the opinion of many 
contemporary posekim. If we accept this latter view, one cannot purchase 
chametz in a supermarket&mdash;even if we know that the chametz in that 
supermarket was sold prior to Pesach&mdash;until such time that it is 
reasonable to assume that the majority of inventory was either purchased before 
or after the eight days of Pesach. (Sorry. No post-Pesach Danish.)</p> 
<p>Some rabbanim have found creative ways to deal with the problem of chametz 
purchased by supermarkets during Pesach, but these solutions have not been 
universally accepted. This subject is complex and is beyond the scope of this 
article.</p> 
<p><b>Q. Now I am really confused. If Rav Moshe maintained that supermarkets 
cannot sell chametz that is acquired during Pesach, why did he advocate the 
sale of supermarkets before Pesach?</b></p> 
<p>A. For two reasons. First, the sale of a supermarket is halachically 
beneficial for the storeowners. By transferring ownership of large quantities 
of chametz that are on the supermarket shelves before Pesach, the owners are 
spared from violating multiple Torah restrictions. Second, the sale limits the 
status of chametz sheavar alav haPesach to the narrow window of chametz that is 
purchased by the store on Pesach, and thus, the turnaround time for the 
depletion of prohibited merchandise is shortened.</p> 
<p><b>Q. Some of the supermarket superchains on the East Coast were founded by 
Jews during the last few decades of the twentieth century. Is it true that in 
the past few years, many of these chains have been sold to non-Jewish investors?
</b></p> 
<p>A. Yes, it is true. In fact, when this happened, many rabbis gave a sigh of 
relief, as we thought that matters had been simplified&mdash;and one could buy 
chametz after Pesach in all those supermarkets. But not so! Shortly thereafter 
we learned that the largest distributor of food items on the East Coast, which 
distributes products to a number of major supermarket chains, is the 
Jewish-owned C&amp;S (Cohen &amp; Siegel). If the distributor owns chametz 
during Pesach, the very same problems of chametz sheavar alav haPesach apply 
equally to all non-Jewish-owned stores supplied by that company. Rabbi Elazar 
Mayer Teitz of Elizabeth, New Jersey, sells the chametz of C&amp;S, but the 
concern discussed above with respect to supermarkets (the inability of the 
rabbi to sell chametz that is acquired on Pesach) has now shifted to the 
distributor, and the problems remain the same.</p> 
<p>Some rabbis are of the opinion that one can purchase chametz after Pesach 
in non-Jewish supermarkets that are supplied by C&amp;S. The logic goes as 
follows: Whatever chametz was in the possession of C&amp;S before Pesach is not 
problematic, since it is sold to a non-Jew before Pesach begins. Chametz 
purchased by C&amp;S after Pesach is obviously acceptable for use. Only chametz 
acquired during Pesach is therefore a matter of concern. No one is certain how 
long it takes for products to move from the C&amp;S warehouse to the 
supermarket shelf. Let&rsquo;s say you visit your local supermarket (which uses 
C&amp;S as a supplier) the week after Pesach and you see a box of Cheerios on 
the shelf. There is no way to determine if that box is chametz sheavar alav 
haPesach. The same uncertainty prevails if you shop two or three weeks later. 
Since we are dealing with chametz sheavar alav haPesach, which is a rabbinic 
injunction, the rule of &ldquo;safek derabbanan lekula&rdquo; applies and one 
can be lenient and purchase the Cheerios.</p> 
<p>Other rabbanim are not comfortable with this approach. We know with 
certainty that at some point in time, most of the chametz in the store will be 
chametz sheavar alav haPesach. Because of our lack of information, we 
can&rsquo;t establish precisely when that is. It is unreasonable to allow the 
purchase of chametz at all times when we know that, at some instance, the 
chametz is prohibited. I have discussed this topic with Rabbi Yisroel Belsky, 
halachic consultant to the OU, on many occasions, and he firmly subscribes to 
the latter view.</p> 
<p><b>Q. Why is everything left unresolved? Everything seems to be a matter of 
dispute and is left hanging. Why is there no bottom line? Tell me the names of 
the stores where I cannot shop after Pesach and give me a firm cut-off date, 
and that will be that. Why is the OU not sharing this information?</b></p> 
<p>A. Halachah is not monolithic and rabbinic disputes abound. Jews have 
always turned to their rabbis for guidance and assistance when there are 
conflicting halachic opinions. For the reasons outlined above, there is no one 
definitive position for where and when chametz can and cannot be purchased 
after Pesach. It is difficult to gather precise information and it is no simple 
matter to chart a course between conflicting halachic positions. The OU does 
not supervise supermarkets, and it is our belief that questions related to 
chametz sheavar alav haPesach fall into the domain of she&rsquo;eilot one 
should ask of his local rabbi.</p> 
<p>Hopefully, you now have a greater appreciation for the complexity of issues 
that are relevant in rendering a halachic decision on these matters.</p> 
<p><b>Q. Can you summarize the discussion?</b></p> 
<p>A. Here it is in a nutshell:<br>
 &bull; The sale of chametz in 
Jewish-owned stores that operate fully on Pesach (i.e., chametz is sold in the 
store) is a matter of dispute.<br>
 &bull; Even for those who assume the sale 
is valid, it is questionable whether the sale is effective for chametz that is 
acquired during Pesach.<br>
 &bull; Ask your rabbi to determine which 
supermarkets are Jewish owned or are supplied by Jewish distributors, and how 
long after Pesach you must wait to purchase chametz sold in these stores.</p> 
<p><b>Q. How about a nice simple closing thought?</b></p> 
<p>A. I once learned a great lesson. I accidentally drove into an exit lane 
and was forced to leave the highway prematurely. This put me on a new road, 
which did not have an exit for over forty miles. It took me more than an hour 
to turn around and get back on the original highway. The lesson here is that 
one wrong turn in life can have long-term consequences.</p> 
<p>Perhaps chametz sheavar alav haPesach teaches the same idea. If one does 
not handle chametz properly before Pesach, the prohibition against eating 
chametz will linger long after Pesach is over.</p> 
<p>Dealing with chametz sheavar alav haPesach in our modern world is not a 
simple matter. This rabbinic injunction underscores the importance of doing 
things correctly up front so that we are not haunted by complications in the 
future.</p>

<h1>Birkat HaChammah (A Short Summary)</h1> 
<p>Birkat HaChammah (the blessing over the sun) is said every 28 years, which 
is the amount of time it takes for the sun to return to the same location in 
the heavens where it was first set during the Creation, 5768 years ago. In a 
very rare occurrence, the completion this year of the 207th 28 year cycle 
coincides with Erev Pesach. To mark this occasion, we recite the blessing<i>
oseh ma&rsquo;aseh v&rsquo;reishit</i>(. . . Who performs the work of Creation) 
upon seeing the sun on Wednesday morning, April 8.</p> 
<p>The Hebrew text of the blessing is &ldquo;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1498; 
&#1488;&#1514;&#1492; &#1492;&rsquo; 
&#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1511;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; 
&#1492;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; &#1506;&#1513;&#1492; 
&#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1492; &#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1497;&#1514;&rdquo;.
</p> 
<p>&gt; The ideal time to recite the blessing is upon witnessing sunrise.</p> 
<p>&gt; The blessing can be said until the end of the third halachic hour of 
the day (which is the same as the last time for eating chametz. According to 
some opinions, it may be recited until midday.</p> 
<p>&gt; The blessing may be said even if only the outline of the sun is 
visible through the clouds.</p> 
<p>&gt; It is preferable to recite the blessing in the presence of a minyan.

<h1>Baby Food on Passover</h1> 
<p>The custom of disallowing the use of &lsquo;<i>Kitniyot&rsquo; </i>(soy or 
corn, for example) was never applied to both infants or the ill who require<i>
kitniyot</i> food. </p> 
<p>Despite the fact that <i>Kitniyot </i>for infants is permissible, the 
Mishna Brura states that it is preferable (but not mandatory) to avoid giving 
infants rice, buckwheat (kasha in Yiddish), or millet on Passover.</p> 
<p>However, one must take care to keep Kitniyoth baby utensils or cutlery away 
from the general kitchen area. Any mixing or washing should be done elsewhere, 
such as in the bathroom sink.</p> 
<p>We have indicated that <i>Kitniyot </i>is permitted for infants &ndash; but 
that doesNOT cover <i>Chametz</i>, or any food that was processed on equipment 
that was not properly cleaned for Passover. Such<i>Chametz </i>is strictly 
prohibited even for infants.</p> 
<p>When we talk about <i>Kitniyot </i>being permitted for infants, it means 
that it would have to be a homemade<i>Kitniyot</i>, unless the Sephardic 
community has a reliable Hechsher on an infant product.</p> 
<p>The <i>Halacha </i>(Jewish law) also suggests that separate pots, dishes 
and cutlery be dedicated to the<i>Kitniyot </i>food. </p> 
<p>Obviously, in cases where a doctor insists that the infant must have <i>
Chametz</i>, the prohibition does not apply. In such a situation, it would be 
preferable (if possible) that a gentile should bring his own<i>Chametz </i>and 
feed the baby. If that is not feasible then a Jew would be permitted to feed 
the infant<i>Chametz</i>.</p> 
<p>The upper age still considered an &lsquo;infant&rsquo; depends on the 
child. Obviously, if the child can eat healthy food that is not Kitniyoth, that 
would be preferable. Usually, the Poskim indicate that two years of age would 
be the upper limit, but if a 2-year old is not ready to eat other food, then 
certainly the limit goes up as high as his or her Bar or Bat Mitzvah.</p> Back

<h1>Who Can Eat Egg Matzah?</h1> 
<p>By: Rabbi Eli Gersten</p> 
<p>According to the Shulchan Aruch, dough made from flour mixed with fruit 
juices or eggs will not become chametz no matter how long it stands, provided 
no water is added. Despite this ruling, Ashkenazic practice mandates that egg 
matzot may only be used by the elderly and the infirm. Furthermore, all the 
precautions associated with ordinary Passover matzot apply to egg matzot. The 
egg matzah must be baked thin, in specially heated ovens for less than eighteen 
minutes and must be carefully guarded from becoming chametz during production. 
(Sephardic custom commonly permits different varieties of flour-juice mixtures 
even when not produced as matzah.) As with the permitted use of kitniyot, when 
serving an individual who needs to consume egg matzot, care should be taken to 
use separate or disposable utensils.</p> 
<p>Although the allowance to eat egg matzah over Passover applies in the 
above-mentioned cases, one cannot fulfill the mitzvah of eating matzah on Seder 
night with egg matzah. The Torah refers to matzah as &ldquo;lechem oni&rdquo; 
poor man&rsquo;s bread, because it is made solely from flour and water, the 
simplest of ingredients. Egg matzah is called &ldquo;matzah ashirah,&rdquo; 
rich man&rsquo;s bread, for it contains more complex ingredients and is 
unacceptable for the mitzvah of matzah. Therefore, even the elderly or infirm 
should (if they are able) eat a kezayit of shmurah matzah on the night of the 
Seder.</p> 
<p>Passover is about the transmission of our rich heritage to the &lsquo;next 
generation&rsquo;. Maintaining and teaching family minhagim is a vital part of 
that legacy&mdash;linking us to the generation of the Exodus. May this Passover 
lead us to our nation&rsquo;s long-awaited, final redemption. Le-shanah

<h1>Caring for Infants and the Infirm</h1> 
<p>By: Rabbi Eli Gersten</p> 
<p>Proper Passover observance requires not only detailed knowledge of <i>
halachot</i>, but also an appreciation and awareness of the many traditions 
(minhagim) adhered to during the holiday dictating what one may and may not eat.
</p> 
<p>While it is important that everyone follow family <i>minhagim</i>, it is 
also necessary to understand specific dispensations when dealing with the 
infirm, elderly or small children. The Rabbis throughout the generations have 
recognized that caring for the infirm, elderly and small children over Passover 
entails extra difficulties and have allowed flexibility concerning minhagim in 
cases of great need.</p> 
<p>There are varied minhagim concerning what one is permitted and not 
permitted to consume including kitniyot (corn, rice, peas, lentils, and beans), 
egg matzah (<i>matzah ashirah</i>), machine matzah, exclusively <i>shmurah 
matzah</i>, food prepared out of one&rsquo;s own family kitchen, dried fruits, 
and the list goes on.</p> 
<p>A prominent minhag upheld by Ashkenazic Jewry entails refraining from eating
<i>kitniyot </i>on Passover. However, there are circumstances when <i>kitniyot 
</i>consumption is permissible. First a review of the two basic reasons for the 
restriction:</p> 
<p>&gt; Since kitniyot bears many similarities to the five grains, one may 
come to mistakenly eat<i>chametz</i>.</p> 
<p>&gt; <i>Kitniyot </i>are often grown or stored with kernels of the five 
grains; if chametz kernels are mixed with the kitniyot, it will be difficult to 
separate them out.</p> 
<p><i>Kitniyot </i>foods are permitted to someone who is ill or a child who 
requires them, and is not yet cognizant of Passover concepts. Even a healthy 
adult may eat<i>kitniyot </i>on Passover if he would otherwise have nothing 
else to eat. In these cases, one should be careful to ensure that the<i>kitniyot
</i>foods do not contain chametz, chametz-processing aids or additives, were 
not processed on chametz equipment and are stored apart from other Passover 
foods, as well as served on separate kitchen utensils.</p> 
<p>The infirm, elderly or children who cannot follow the stringencies (<i>
chumrot</i>) of a particular minhag may be lenient. If the ailment is such that 
the person is unlikely to be able to follow a minhag, even in future years,

<h1>Getting to Know Your Matzah</h1> 
<p>By: Rabbi Yaakov Horowitz</p> 
<p>Matzah, at the same time the simplest and most complex of kosher products, 
consists of just two basic ingredients &ndash; flour and water. On Passover we 
avoid all wheat based products save one &ndash; the matzah which is eaten at the
<i>Seder </i>in fulfillment of a biblical obligation, and that which we eat 
throughout the holiday. How is the wheat kernel transformed into matzah while 
avoiding becoming forbidden<i>chametz</i>?</p> 
<p><b>The Basic Ingredients</b></p> 
<p>For most of the year, flour mixed with water is considered a 
kosher-friendly combination. But special production requirements come into play 
when blending the two for Passover. The merging of these ingredients to make 
Passover matzah necessitates a meticulously monitored environment, one that 
prevents the product from becoming<i>chametz</i>, which is defined by our 
rabbis as fermented grain.</p> 
<p><b>Levels of Shmurah Flour</b></p> 
<p>All wheat flour used in matzah production must be continually supervised. 
While kosher supervision of Passover flour used in for &ldquo;regular&rdquo; 
matzah begins prior to its milling, the flour used in &ldquo;<i>shmurah</i>
&rdquo; (watched) matzah is supervised from the time that the wheat is 
harvested in the field. Wheat can only be used to make matzah flour if it has 
been inspected against any signs of moisture. The flour mill, bins, and 
transport vessels must be koshered for Passover; and any equipment used for 
chametz-milling which cannot be adequately cleaned, must be effectively 
sequestered.</p> 
<p><b><i>Mayim Shelanu</i></b></p> 
<p>Water to be used in matzah baking must be left to stand overnight (to 
ensure that it is allowed to cool). This water is then referred to as<i>mayim 
shelanu</i>(water which has &ldquo;slept&rdquo;). </p> 
<p>Therefore, the mashgichim supervising the matzah bakery must take care that:
<br> 1. the water tanks are filled immediately prior to <br>
 nightfall;<br>
 
2. there is sufficient<i>mayim shelanu</i> for the next day&rsquo;s matzah 
production;<br>
 3. no additional water is added to the mayim shelanu tank 
during the day&rsquo;s production.</p> 
<p><b>Safeguarding Against Insect Infestation</b></p> 
<p>The potential of insect infestation must be addressed when dealing with any 
grain product.</p> 
<p>Matzah bakeries should safeguard against infestation in these ways:<br>
 1. 
quick turnaround of flour which allows the least amount of time between 
grinding and baking;<br>
 2. regular cleaning of flour bins and receptacles;<br>
 3. maximum cooling of all flour silos and production areas;<br>
 4. rigid 
sifting protocol of flour prior to baking.</p> 
<p><b>Flour-Dust Control </b></p> 
<p>The flour and water that make matzah must be mixed and kneaded into dough 
in a rabbinically-supervised, controlled environment. Any flour- dust generated 
by the mixing process must be contained to ensure that it does not drift into 
other areas of production, thereby contaminating the dough being rolled into 
matzah. So it is essential that the flour be restricted to a mixing-process 
station. As an additional safeguard, the mixing (flour and water) and rolling 
(dough) should best take place in two completely separated areas.</p> 
<p><b>Heat and Fermentation</b></p> 
<p>The heat generated by the oven and the machinery running in an industrial 
setting often cause bakery temperatures to rise. But excessive heat, which is a 
primary factor connected with fermentation, must be avoided in a matzah bakery. 
Therefore, special precautions should be instituted to maintain temperatures 
around the oven door (<i>pi hatanur</i>). </p> 
<p><b>18-Minute Matzah/Cleanup of the Matzah Bakery</b></p> 
<p>The phrase &ldquo;special 18-minute matzah&rdquo; is actually a misnomer 
since all matzah bakeries, producing either hand or machine matzot, are 
equipped with the proper supervision to ensure that less than 18 minutes 
elapses from the time the flour touches the water until the matzah enters the 
oven. (There are those who set the 18-minute standard to include complete 
baking time as well.)</p> 
<p>In current matzah parlance, &ldquo;18-minute matzah&rdquo; means that the 
entire matzah line is cleaned every 18 minutes; this includes mixing utensils, 
table or conveyor lines, matzah cutters and scorers (dockers) and every other 
surface that comes in contact with the dough. The result is a product that has 
not just been baked in less than 18 minutes, but one that has also not come in 
contact with any dough older than 18 minutes. However, this special 
time-sensitive cleaning process can be challenging, particularly when dealing 
with older matzah-making equipment that is pitted or has cracks and crannies.
</p> 
<p>Cleaning the matzah line every 18 minutes produces a <i>mehudar </i>
(halachically superior) product, as long as each clean-up process is thorough, 
i.e., that every matzah crumb and all residue are removed. If, however, if any 
residual material remains after an imperfect clean-up, the matzah produced on 
that line is considered of an inferior kashrut standard. According to the 
principle of<i>eisek </i>(continual handling), as long as the equipment is 
operating, any residual pieces will not become<i>chametz</i>. Consequently, if 
there were no shutdown every 18 minutes, any residual material in continuous 
motion would not compromise the system. However, if the equipment is stopped 
without it being completely cleaned, the residual material will be rendered 
chametz and could adversely impact the &ldquo;18 minute matzah&rdquo;.</p> 
<p><i>Unacceptable Matzot </i></p> 
<p>In order for matzah to be properly and thoroughly baked, sustained levels 
of heat are required for a prescribed period of time; if the matzah is not 
thoroughly baked, it is considered chametz. Mashgichim must therefore 
continuously monitor ovens against any drop in baking temperatures.<br>
 Two 
other types of inadequately baked matzot are:<br>
 1. <i>kefulot</i>
&mdash;matzot with folds;<br>
 2. <i>nefuchot</i>&mdash;if the scoring is 
insufficient, the matzah will swell (like a pita) indicating that the center of 
the matzah has not been adequately baked.</p> 
<p>Articulated Intent </p> 
<p>Jewish thought attributes to Passover, not just the freedom from physical 
servitude, but also our people&rsquo;s emancipation of spirit. In addition to 
the multitude of material requirements in making matzah, there is one 
additional obligation &mdash; every batch of matzah is preceded by the 
baker&rsquo;s declaration, &ldquo;<i>le-shem matzat mitzvah</i>,&rdquo; that it 
is being baked to provide matzah for all who would taste freedom in the 
fulfillment of the Divine command.</p> Back to OU Passover Home Page Print

<h1>What Could Be Hiding in My Romaine?</h1> 
<p>By: Rabbi Dovid Bistricer</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard or even asked the following question: 
&ldquo;Why is there such a preoccupation with the potential of finding bugs in 
produce these days? I don&rsquo;t recall observing my grandmother checking 
fruits and vegetables for signs of infestation.&rdquo; There are actually a 
number of contributing factors, including changes in diet, growing climates and 
the usage of pesticides; all these have impacted the likelihood of finding 
insects in some of the foods that we eat. So, it is worth our while to 
&ldquo;check&rdquo; into this further.</p> 
<p>The Torah in Leviticus clearly specifies the prohibition of consuming 
insects that are of a size that is visible to the naked eye. In fact, the 
consumption of a single insect can involve a violation of as many as five or 
six Torah prohibitions. Since vegetables grow in the earth, they inevitably 
come in contact with insects; in many cases, vegetables become the 
insect&rsquo;s home. Vegetables with cracks and crevices are more vulnerable to 
infestation, since these are areas for insects to become trapped or hide. 
Undoubtedly, this issue needs to be addressed in a serious, balanced approach.
</p> 
<p>Some consumers assume farmers and companies are wary of insects in 
vegetables and take proper precautionary measures. While this assumption may 
seem reasonable, it has proven to be untrue. TheFDA tolerance levels of insect 
infestation in produce are far more permissive than halachic requirements. For 
example, the US government allows averages of up to 60 insects per 100 grams in 
frozen broccoli, and up to 50 insects per 100 grams of frozen spinach. 
Although, farmers might use pesticides to curb insect infestation levels, the 
effects are often limited.DDT and other highly effective previously-used 
insecticides have been legally banned due to associated health risks. Also, 
insects often develop immunity to certain pesticides over time. The rising 
popularity of organic produce has further complicated matters. The term organic 
implies the products were grown without pesticides, herbicides, and synthetic 
fertilizers. Consequently, organic produce could be subject to higher levels of 
insect infestation.</p> 
<p>Due to seasonal influences and insect life cycles, the incidence of 
infestation in many vegetables varies throughout the year. The prevalence of 
imports, as well as many advances in produce-storage and preservation 
technology, results in seasonal fruits and vegetables being available 
throughout the year. In addition, it is often impossible to trace the origin of 
a particular vegetable. Broccoli sold in the New York area supermarkets may 
originate from Mexico one week and from California or Florida the next. One of 
these locations may have experienced drought conditions during the growing 
season. In another, unusually heavy rains may have adversely affected the crop. 
In the third, due to local regulations, little or no pesticide may have been 
applied. Without this knowledge, one may be tempted to assume that there is no 
need to check broccoli after having found several heads of the vegetables free 
of infestation the previous week. One week&rsquo;s findings may tell little 
about the next week&rsquo;s produce.</p> 
<p><b>Not All Vegetables Need Checking</b></p> 
<p>The requirement to check vegetables depends on the likelihood that an 
insect may be present.</p> 
<p>Vegetables that are not commonly infested do not require checking. </p> 
<p>The Halacha Recognizes Three Levels of Infestation:</p> 
<p> 1. <i>Muchzak Betola&rsquo;im</i>&mdash;experience has shown that a 
certain food during a particular season is likely to contain infestation a 
majority of the time.</p> 
<p> 2. <i>Mi&rsquo;ut Hamatzu&rsquo;i</i>&mdash;a significant minority of 
samples in a particular food are expected to contain infestation. The OU 
accepts the position of the Mishkenot Yaakov that asserts this is at least a 
likelihood of 10%.</p> 
<p> 3. <i>Mi&rsquo;ut She-eino Matzu&rsquo;i</i>&mdash;it is unlikely to find 
infestation in a particular food. Experience has shown that at best, only an 
insignificant minority has proven to be infested.</p> 
<p>We are obligated to check vegetables that fall into the first two 
categories, but not the third. Ascertaining whether a vegetable is subject to 
infestation &mdash; and thereby necessitating checking before use &mdash; is 
mostly determined based on experience. Several manuals and books are now 
available on inspecting produce and serve as excellent guides to educate the 
typical consumer. They include<i>The OU Guide to Checking Fruits, Vegetables 
and Berries</i>, 2nd Edition. </p> 
<p><b>Bugs and Spirituality</b></p> 
<p>The Torah clearly states that adherence to the stringency of not consuming 
sheratzim (insects) preserves the sanctity of the Jewish people. After 
delineating the various forbidden sheratzim, the Torah commands, 
&lsquo;&lsquo;&hellip;for I am Hashem Who brought you up from the land of Egypt 
to be your God, and you shall be holy as I am Holy&rsquo;&rsquo; (Leviticus 
11:45). Rashi cites Torat Kohanim where the term &lsquo;&lsquo;&hellip;Who 
brought you up from the land of Egypt&rsquo;&rsquo; is analyzed. So often in 
the Torah, Hashem speaks of simply having brought us out of Egypt. Why with 
regard to forbidden insects does the Torah deviate from its usual phraseology? 
Based upon this inference, the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught the following 
lesson: &lsquo;&lsquo;Says Hashem, &lsquo;Had I brought the Jewish people up 
from Egypt for no other reason than that they should not defile themselves by 
eating sheratzim as the other nations do, that would have been 
sufficient.&rsquo;&rdquo; The consumption of an insect actually diminishes us 
spiritually. By virtue of this mitzvah, the Jewish people are raised to a 
unique status. Therefore, the terminology: &lsquo;&lsquo;Hashem, who brought 
you up&rdquo; is used. Wishing you all a bug-free Passover. And may this be the 
year we all &ldquo;go up from the land of Egypt,&rdquo; and enter Yerushalayim 
together.</p>

<p></p> <b>How to Check Romaine</b> 
<p></p> 
<p>Romaine lettuce is commonly used for maror. This lettuce type is known as 
an open leaf variety. This means that as they sprout forth from the ground, the 
leaves begin to open up like a flower. Toward the end of their growth, they 
begin to close around the stalk. Since romaine lettuce grows open, it is much 
more prone to insect infestation throughout the head than other varieties of 
lettuce that primarily grow as a closed ball.</p> 
<p>The insects most commonly found in open leaf lettuce are small black or 
green aphids and thrips. The leaves of the vegetable often camouflage these 
insects. The open structure of these vegetables allows insects to penetrate the 
entire head. Often, insects may be found between the innermost layers of leaves 
of an infested head. Therefore, each leaf must be washed and checked 
individually. The use of a light box for checking lettuce can be extremely 
convenient and helpful. However, even if a light box is not used, it is crucial 
to examine both sides of each leaf against a good source of light.</p> 
<p><b>Checking for insects</b></p> 
<p>Below are step by step recommendations for how to properly check romaine 
lettuce for insects:</p> 
<p>1. Cut off the lettuce base and separate the leaves from one another.<br>
 
2. Soak leaves in a solution of cold water and soap. The proper amount of soap 
has been added when some bubbles are observed in the water.<br>
 3. Agitate 
lettuce leaves in the soapy<br>
 solution.<br>
 4. Spread each leaf, taking 
care to<br>
 expose all its curls and crevices. Using a heavy stream of water 
or sink hose, remove all foreign matter and soap from both sides of each leaf. 
Alternatively, a vegetable brush may be used on both sides of the leaf.<br>
 5. 
Leaves should be checked over a light box or against strong overhead lighting 
to verify that the washing procedure has been effective. Pay careful attention 
to the folds and crevices in the leaf where insects have been known to hold 
tightly through several washings.</p> 
<p>Occasionally, worms may be found in burrows within the body of the leaf. 
Look for a narrow translucent burrow speckled with black dots breaking up the 
deep green color of the leaf. These burrows will often trap the worm within the 
leaf. To rid the leaf of these worms, carefully slit the bumpy part within the 
burrow with a sharp knife and remove the worm. It is important to note that 
many of these varieties feature curly leaves with many folds in which the 
insects tend to hide. It is therefore recommended that they be washed and 
checked with particular caution.</p> Back to OU Passover Home Page Print Article
<h1>Birkat Hachammah: An Evocative Blessing</h1> 
<p>By: Rabbi Dr. J. David Bleich</p> 
<p>Why Is This Erev Pesach Different From Every Other Erev Pesach?</p> 
<p>To a Jew every mitzvah is treasured; each is a source of delight. As 
expressed by the psalmist, &ldquo;Happy is the man who fears God, who desires 
His mitzvot greatly&rdquo; (Psalms 112:1). Little wonder then that Birkat 
haChammah, despite its relative simplicity and infrequency of occurrence, has 
received extensive treatment in rabbinic literature. The very rarity of its 
occurrence has served to magnify the rejoicing in its performance and to 
enhance the scholarly attention it has received.</p> 
<p>Birkat haChammah is indeed a rare event&mdash;an event that recurs only 
every twenty-eight years. Even rarer is the occurrence of Birkat haChammah on 
the fourteenth day of Nisan, erev Pesach, as will be the case this coming 
spring. The phenomenon marked by Birkat haChammah did coincide with erev Pesach 
in 5685 (1925). However, before 5685, there was a gap of more than six 
centuries since Birkat haChammah&rsquo;s last previous occurrence on an erev 
Pesach in 5069 (1309).</p> 
<p>It is popularly assumed that the universe was created in Tishrei. That 
assumption is prompted, at least in part, by the fact that the calendar year 
begins on the first day of Tishrei. However, the Gemara, Rosh Hashanah 10b-11a, 
records a controversy between Rabbi Eliezer and and Rabbi Joshua with regard to 
whether the world was created in Tishrei or in Nisan. Birkat haChammah was 
ordained on the basis of the hypothesis that the universe was created in Nisan.
</p> 
<p>Genesis 1:14-19 records that the sun was created on the fourth day of the 
week. According to rabbinic tradition, the sun was created at the very 
beginning of the day and appeared in the sky in the position occupied at 
Tekufat Nisan, i.e., the sun was set into place upon the onset of the fourth 
day at the position of the vernal equinox. Thus, Birkat haChammah is recited 
whenever the vernal equinox occurs at the very beginning of the fourth day of 
the week. At the time of the equinox, day and night are equal in duration, each 
being twelve hours in length. Since in the Jewish calendar each day begins with 
nightfall, the beginning of the fourth day is 6:00 PM Tuesday evening. In an 
annual calendar comprised of 365 days successive vernal equinoxes will occur 
each year on the same day of the month (allowing, of course, for a minor 
variation in a leap year) but one and one quarter days later in the week. It is 
then a relatively easy matter to perform the calculations that demonstrate that 
successive equinoxes will occur upon the advent of the eve of a Wednesday only 
once in twenty-eight years. Birkat haChammah is recited when the sun becomes 
visible after a vernal equinox that occurs at the beginning of the eve of a 
Wednesday as it did at the time of Creation. At the time of the equinox the sun 
occupies a position relative to earth identical to the position it occupied at 
the time of Creation. On the rare occasions that this phenomenon occurs on 
Tuesday evening the blessing &ldquo;Oseh ma&rsquo;aseh bereishit&mdash;He who 
makes the work of Creation&rdquo; is recited upon the appearance of the sun on 
Wednesday morning.</p> 
<p>The 365-day solar year reflects the annual revolution of the earth around 
the sun. The Jewish calendar is lunisolar rather than solar, i.e., it is a 
lunar calendar based upon a cycle of twelve revolutions of the moon around the 
earth with corrections in the form of periodic intercalated months in order to 
reconcile the 354-day lunar year with the 365-day solar year. Those corrections 
are designed to prevent the migration of the yamim tovim throughout the solar 
year so that they may be observed in their appointed (solar) seasons. 
Consequently, each occurrence of Birkat haChammah will not be on the same day 
of the Jewish month. The dates of Birkat haChammah fluctuate from late Adar to 
late Nisan but because of the vagaries of the calendar the coincidence of 
Birkat haChammah and erev Pesach is extremely rare.</p> 
<p>The occurrence of Birkat haChammah on erev Pesach conveys a significant 
message. Although the celebration of Pesach commemorates the Exodus from Egypt 
and Birkat haChammah recalls Creation, the two share a singular common motif.
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Chayyav adam lirot et atzmo ke&rsquo;ilu hu yatza 
miMitzrayim&mdash;a person is obligated to look upon himself as if he exited 
from Egypt.&rdquo; On Pesach a Jew is obligated not simply to recall a 
historical event but to imagine himself an actual participant in that event. 
Rambam&rsquo;s formulation is &ldquo;Chayyev adam leharot et atzmo&mdash;a 
person is obligated to show himself&rdquo; as one who departed from Egypt. A 
fantasy, to be sure. It is difficult enough to enter into a fantasy, yet Rambam 
requires not only that we enter into the fantasy but that we act it out as 
well. The essence of the obligation is internalization of long-ago events to 
the point that they are both intellectually and emotionally no different from 
personally experienced phenomena. To what purpose? To appreciate the 
omnipotence of the Deity who made possible the miraculous events surrounding 
the Exodus. For Rambam, intellectual appreciation is insufficient; it must lead 
to an emotional experience perceivable to an onlooker.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;You shall love the Lord, your God&rdquo; is defined by Rambam (Sefer 
Hamitzvot, Mitzvot Aseh 3; Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah 2:2) as demanding 
intellectual awareness. &ldquo;You shall love your fellow&rdquo; mandates 
performing, or abstaining from, physical acts. Remembering the Exodus on the 
night of the Seder is unique among mitzvot in demanding an emotional 
metamorphosis. That obligation is not triggered by a contemporaneous, external 
event, but is discharged by an awareness born of introspection.</p> 
<p>The greatness and grandeur of God require acknowledgement when His 
handiwork is actually observed. The sprouting of buds on fruit trees evokes 
thanksgiving for that beneficence. Catching sight of strange and exotic animals 
occasions a blessing acknowledging the Divine power that produced a variegated 
animal kingdom. Phenomena such as the appearance of lightning or meteors and 
sighting colossal mountains or deep canyons demand acknowledgment of God as 
&ldquo;He who makes the work of Creation.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The essence of Birkat haChammah is the blessing &ldquo;Oseh ma&rsquo;aseh 
bereishit&mdash;He who makes the work of Creation.&rdquo; The formula is 
identical to that of the berachah pronounced upon visual perception of a giant, 
an elephant, a monkey, lightning, a meteor, Mount Everest or the Grand Canyon. 
The blessing, when pronounced on those occasions, is triggered solely by a 
sensory perception. Birkat haChammah is more than a bit different. To be sure, 
the blessing &ldquo;Oseh ma&rsquo;aseh bereishit&rdquo; pronounced on that 
occasion is also triggered by the appearance of the sun. But visual perception 
of the sun&rsquo;s rays on the day of Birkat haChammah is no different from 
that experience on any other day. Sighting an elephant is far more exciting 
than coming upon a barnyard animal; lightning is awe-inspiring in a way in 
which dark clouds are not; the majesty of God is revealed in the presence of a 
massive, peaked mountain in a way that it is not revealed in a common range of 
hills. But what is it that is singular about the sun on the day of Birkat 
haChammah that requires a human response in the form of a berachah?</p> 
<p>It cannot be that simple visual perception of the sun is the factor that 
occasions the blessing since there is nothing extraordinary in sunrise on the 
morrow of a vernal equinox that occurs at the beginning of a Wednesday. Nothing 
spectacular is perceived on the occasion of the return of the sun to its 
original position in the heavens. Indeed, were empirical observation its sole 
means of discovery, the event would unquestionably pass without notice. Rather 
it is the occurrence of the vernal equinox on a particular day of the week and 
at a particular hour of that day that occasions the berachah. But although the 
sun can be seen with the naked eye, the equinox cannot. The day of the week can 
be ascertained by consulting a calendar, the time of day by glancing at a 
sundial or a clock and the equinox by performing simple calculations. However, 
associating the appearance of the sun at a unique position relative to earth 
with a particular day of the week and a specific hour of the day requires a 
great deal of reflection. The blessing recited on the occasion of Birkat 
haChammah, &ldquo;He who makes the work of Creation,&rdquo; is singular among 
berachot in that it is occasioned by an external event that acquires meaning as 
a testimonial to God as Creator of the universe only when that event is 
reflected upon, internalized and understood in a profound manner. Unlike other 
visual experiences that occasion a blessing, Birkat haChammah is predicated 
upon intellectual cognition.</p> 
<p>But, objectively speaking, all of this is a mirage. The solar calendar is 
not precisely 365 days in length. The solar year is actually 365 days, 5 hours, 
48 minutes and 46 seconds in length, and so the vernal equinox occurs earlier 
and earlier each year. That problem was essentially resolved by the 
modifications made with introduction of the present Gregorian calendar.</p> 
<p>In ordaining Birkat haChammah, the Sages were well aware of the lack of 
precision in the solar calculations they attributed to Shmuel, one of the 
Amoraim. They recognized full well that the calculations of Rav Adda were far 
more accurate and relied upon them in their own astronomical determinations. 
Rav Adda reckoned the solar year as being 365 days, 5 hours, 55 minutes and 25 
25/57 seconds in length. Nevertheless, Chazal employed the solar calendar of 
Shmuel for two purposes: for recitation of tal umatar and in introducing Birkat 
haChammah.</p> 
<p>Daily recitation of tal umatar, a prayer for rain, begins with the advent 
of the rainy season in the Land of Israel. The rainy season is deemed to 
commence on the sixtieth day following the autumnal equinox. The autumnal 
equinox is, of course, a solar phenomenon. The equinox is established as 
occurring precisely 182 1/2 days after the vernal equinox, again based upon the 
premise that the solar year is exactly 365 days in length. The reason for 
adopting Shmuel&rsquo;s calculations for this purpose, even though they were 
known to be inexact, is quite evident: the tal umatar prayer must be recited by 
everyone. A method was required to facilitate fulfillment of that obligation 
that would enable any individual to determine the proper date for commencing 
recitation of tal umatar. Rav Adda&rsquo;s far more accurate, but far more 
complicated, calculations required mathematical acumen well beyond the 
capability of the common man.</p> 
<p>However, Birkat haChammah is the celebration of the anniversary of an 
astronomical event. Given the correct length of the solar year, or Rav 
Adda&rsquo;s close approximation thereof, it is clear that in the 5,768 years 
that have elapsed since Creation the vernal equinox has never recurred at its 
original hour. What, then, is the meaning of Birkat haChammah recited every 
twenty-eight years? Why did Chazal decree celebration of a nonfactual cosmic 
phenomenon?</p> 
<p>If we focus upon the commonality that exists between remembering the Exodus 
and Birkat haChammah, the pieces fall into place. Pesach is designed to cause a 
Jew to reflect upon the miracles surrounding that historical event and come to 
a personal awareness of God &ldquo;who brought us out of Egypt, out of the 
house of bondage.&rdquo; Birkat haChammah is designed to cause man to reflect 
upon observed phenomena, to internalize those phenomena and achieve a profound 
awareness of God as Creator of the universe.</p> 
<p>Since Birkat haChammah is designed to trigger human cognitive processes, 
objective reality is almost inconsequential. To the popular mind, the Julian 
calendar&mdash;and hence the solar year of Shmuel&mdash;was correct. For 
centuries, it was, by and large, unquestioned both among Jews and non-Jews 
because it proved to be quite suitable for human needs. In adopting 
Shmuel&rsquo;s calculations for Birkat haChammah, Chazal in no way intended to 
denigrate or diminish the verities discovered by science. Quite to the 
contrary, they relied only upon the more accurate view of Rav Adda for carrying 
out the more esoteric task of performing the calculations necessary to assure 
the integrity of the calendar.</p> 
<p>Nevertheless, the Sages seized upon the widespread popular presumption 
regarding the length of the solar year and used it as a tool to underscore and 
to reinforce a profound theological truth. Since Birkat haChammah is an 
acknowledgment of a renewed perception of God as Creator of the universe, the 
cause of that awareness is not crucial. Chazal seized upon acceptance of 
Shmuel&rsquo;s determination of the length of the solar year as a means of 
prompting people to focus upon the wondrous nature of God as the Author of 
Creation. The blessing is evocative rather than responsive. It is designed to 
arouse man from his lethargy, to force him to reflect upon this cosmic 
phenomenon, to summon him to contemplation.</p> The occurrence of Birkat 
haChammah on erev Pesach is more than a curious coincidence. Man must not only 
acknowledge but personally perceive God as both the Redeemer who led us out of 
Egypt and as the Creator of the universe. On Pesach, matzah and maror are 
empirical triggers designed to encourage us to acknowledge God as our personal 
Redeemer. The blessing pronounced upon the visual appearance of the sun on the 
day of Birkat haChammah is designed to prompt Jews to reflect upon the cosmic 
event that occurred on a particular hour of that day of the week and thereby to 
acknowledge God as Creator of the universe. That intellectual awareness should 
become acute in a manner akin to sensory perception, with the result that man 
will not simply accept the doctrine of creatio ex nihilo in an abstract, 
detached manner but experientially perceive God as the omnipotent Creator.
<p>Birkat haChammah coincides with erev Pesach only on the rarest of 
occasions. When this does happen the appropriate response should be to seize 
the occasion for intellectual appreciation of the wondrous work of the Almighty 
that, in turn, must lead to a profound understanding and recognition that He 
alone is the God of Redemption and the God of Creation.</p> 
<p>Some time prior to Birkat haChammah on erev Pesach in the year 5685 (1925), 
the Ostrovtzer Rebbe reported that Birkat haChammah had coincided with erev 
Pesach only twice before in the history of the world: in the year of the Exodus 
from Egypt and in the year prior to the event commemorated by Purim. As noted 
in the forthcoming expanded edition of my book, Bircas HaChammah, the 
Ostrovtzer seems to have been in error both with regard to the dates and to the 
number of times that this coincidence has taken place. However, his reaction 
was very much to the point.<br>
 Noting the presumed coincidence of Birkat 
haChammah with deliverance from slavery in Egypt and deliverance from the 
diabolical plot of Haman, the Ostrovtzer prayerfully anticipated that (what he 
presumed to be) the third such occurrence would be the harbinger of the 
deliverance of Israel from its present, and final, exile. We failed to merit 
that deliverance in 5685 but it is our fervent prayer that, should the Messiah 
fail to have arrived earlier, Birkat haChammah on erev Pesach 5769 will signal 
the ultimate Redemption.</p>

<p><b>The Beraita: Birkat haChammah</b></p> 
<p>The primary source for Birkat haChammah is the following beraita 
accompanied by the Amora Abaye&rsquo;s elucidation, found in the Gemara, 
Berachot 59b:</p> 
<p>Our Rabbis taught: He who sees the sun at its turning point, the moon in 
its power, the planets in their orbits or the signs of the zodiac in their 
order should say: Blessed are You who makes the work of Creation.</p> 
<p>And when [does this happen]? Abaye said: Every twenty-eight years when the 
cycle begins again and the Nisan [spring] equinox falls in Saturn on the 
evening of Tuesday, going into Wednesday.</p> 
<p>One who sees the sun on the morning following the vernal equinox when the 
equinox, as reckoned by the Jewish calendar, occurs at 6:00 pm (Jerusalem solar 
time) on Tuesday evening&mdash;an event which occurs at intervals of 
twenty-eight years&mdash;should pronounce the following blessing:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Baruch Atah Hashem &hellip; oseh ma&rsquo;aseh bereishit, Blessed 
are You, Hashem &hellip;.who makes the work of Creation.&rdquo;<br>

<h1>What You Need to Know When Passover Arrives on Saturday Night</h1> 
<p>Every year, Jews around the world anticipate hearing the pivotal four 
questions at their seder tables: this year they&rsquo;ll be asking themselves a 
fifth one: Why is this Passover different from most others?</p> 
<p>This year, Passover arrives immediately following Shabbat &ndash; a rare 
occurrence that creates unique circumstances, directly affecting the typical 
Passover preparations. (You may remember that this last occurred back in 2005. 
Take heart, it will not recur until 2021.) The key adjustments may sound 
daunting at first, but taken step by step, they are definitely doable.</p> 
<p>On the eve of Passover (14th of <i>Nissan</i>), all firstborn males are 
required to fast, commemorating the final plague when God killed the firstborn 
Egyptians, while the firstborn Jews were saved. Since this year this date falls 
on Shabbat when fasting is not permitted, it will be observed on Thursday, 
April 17. The fast can be circumvented if the individual participates in a<i>
seudat mitzvah</i>, <i>such </i>as a siyum, celebrating the completion of a 
portion of Torah learning, usually held in the synagogue following the 
shacharit service.</p> 
<p>The search for leaven, known as <i>Bedikat Chametz</i>, will take place on 
Thursday night, the 13th of Nisan, April 17th. After the search is completed, 
one recites the<i>Kol Chamira</i>, the nullification declaration for any 
chametz that may have been missed. This mitzvah is performed with a blessing 
only if done on this night; if someone is traveling, he or she should conduct 
the search on the night of departure without reciting the blessing.</p> 
<p>After the search is completed, the remaining <i>chametz </i>is carefully 
collected and put aside to be burned the following morning. Unlike other years, 
the second<i>Kol Chamira </i>is not said following the burning of the chametz, 
since<i>chametz </i>may be consumed until Shabbat morning, during the fourth 
hour.</p> 
<p>Arrangements for the sale of <i>chametz </i>to a non-Jew must be made 
before Shabbat. This transaction won&rsquo;t go into effect until after 
Shabbat, making it permissible to eat<i>challah </i>on Shabbat. If someone 
forgets to sell his<i>chametz </i>before Shabbat, a rabbi should be consulted. 
<br> The Shabbat Meals</p> 
<p><i>Chametz </i>may not be consumed after &ldquo;the fourth hour,&rdquo; on 
the eve of Passover, which is approximately 10:40 a.m. in New York City; check 
the OU Guide to Passover or consult your local Orthodox rabbi for the time in 
your area. You should cook only kosher for Passover foods for all the meals on 
this Shabbat and to serve them on Passover dishes. But since some bread must be 
eaten, here are two ways this can be done:</p> 
<p>1. Eat the <i>challah </i>before the meal over a disposable napkin. The 
napkin with any leftover crumbs should be folded up and completely eliminated 
from the home (e.g., flushed down the toilet). Make sure to wash your hands 
before sitting down to the Shabbat meal.</p> 
<p>2. Use egg matzah instead of actual <i>challah</i>. But egg matzah is only 
considered bread when eaten in sufficient quantities. Some rabbinic authorities 
rule that so long as it is eaten in the context of a filling meal it is 
considered bread. Because egg matzah is not<i>chametz</i>, there are differing 
opinions as to until what time it may be eaten on the eve of Passover, so a 
rabbi should be consulted.</p> 
<p>Most synagogues will start Shabbat prayer services very early, leaving 
sufficient time to finish eating chametz before the end of &ldquo;the fourth 
hour.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><i>Se&rsquo;udah shlishit</i> (the third meal) is eaten after midday. By 
that time, chametz, and, according to Ashkenazic practice, also egg matzah, may 
no longer be eaten. Here are some options:</p> 1. You could omit bread 
altogether and eat just meat, fish, or fruit. 2. Since cooked matzah is 
permitted until the 10th hour of the day, the obligation can be fulfilled by 
eating matzah balls. 3. Rabbi Abraham Abele Gombiner, a leading Torah scholar 
of the 17th century, author of<i>Magen Avraham</i>, a commentary on the Code of 
Jewish Law, recommends eating two Shabbat meals with bread in the morning, 
relying on those opinions that allow the se&rsquo;udah shlishit to be eaten 
before midday.
<p>Since we are not permitted to make preparations on Shabbat for Yom Tov, all 
preparations for the seder (including setting the seder table) should be made 
after nightfall.</p>

<h1>Prepared Baby Food</h1> 
<p>1. Gerber Baby Food in all vegetable varieties <b>except for the sweet 
potatoes</b> are acceptable for Passover <i>l&rsquo;chatchila</i> when bearing 
the OU.</p> 
<p>2.Currently, Beechnut has discontinued its Kosher for Pesach supervision, 
and the Mashgiach no longer oversees the kosherization process. In addition, 
ascorbic acid, which may be chometz, is added to the fruit. Nonetheless, our 
investigation has shown that the standard cleaning procedures that are in place 
constitute kosherization, and the ascorbic acid is botel bishishim. 
Halachically, the baby food fruit and vegetables that are not combined with 
cereal are Kosher for Pesach. Nonetheless, since kosherization is performed 
without a Mashgiach, this situation is not optimal, and we recommend that you 
prepare your own baby food.</p> Back to OU Passover Home Page Print Article 
<h1>Shopping after Passover</h1> 
<p>Chametz owned by a Jew during the holiday may not be consumed even after 
the holiday is over. Consequently, when shopping for chametz products after 
Passover, one must take measures to avoid chametz products that may have been 
subject to Jewish ownership during the festival. Because these restrictions are 
not limited to private individuals, Jewish owned stores, food manufacturers and 
distributors are required to rid themselves of chametz before Passover in an 
halachically valid manner, and consumers need to stay clear of chametz products 
that were in such Jewish possession during Passover. Because tracking 
distribution is very complex and these determinations can be difficult, we 
suggest that ask your Rabbi for guidance.</p> Back to OU Passover Home Page

<h1>Tevilat Keilim</h1> 
<p>Since many people purchase new utensils before Passover, we present here 
the laws of<i>Tevilat Keilim</i>, immersing utensils in a <i>mikveh </i>prior 
to their use.</p> 
<p><b>Utensils that need <i>tevilat keilim</i>:</b></p> 
<p>1 The Torah teaches that food utensils acquired from a non-Jew must undergo 
<i>tevilah</i>, that is, ritual immersion in a kosher <i>mikveh</i>. Even 
utensils bought from a Jewish store must undergo<i>tevilah </i>if at some point 
they were owned by a non-Jew. When one is genuinely in doubt,<i>tevilah </i>
should be done without a<i>brachah</i>.</p> 
<p>2. The Torah lists six metals that require <i>tevilah</i>: gold, silver, 
copper, iron, tin, and lead. Newer metals such as aluminum, as well as hybrid 
metals such as steel, are generally assumed to require<i>tevilah </i>as well. 
</p> 
<p>3. Because glass shares certain properties with metal, we are obligated by 
the Rabbis to<i>tovel </i>glass as well. All types of glass are <i>toveled </i>
with a<i>brachah </i>including crystal, Pyrex, and Corelle.</p> 
<p>4. Wood, ceramic, stone, rubber, and all types of plastics do not require 
<i>tevilah</i>.</p> 
<p>5. The need to tovel glazed china and porcelain is debated amongst the <i>
poskim</i>. Many are of the opinion that these items should be <i>toveled </i>
without a<i>brachah</i>.</p> 
<p>6. If a utensil is made of a substance that is exempt from <i>tevilah</i>, 
but is held together with metal screws or rings, then this utensil requires 
tevilah. If the metal does not come in contact with the food, then a<i>brachah 
</i>should not be recited. </p> 
<p>7. Metal utensils that are coated with other materials that do not require 
<i>tevilah</i>, such as a Teflon coated frying pan, should be toveled without a 
<i>berachah</i>. </p> 
<p>8. Utensils used to prepare food while it is still in an inedible state 
should undergo<i>tevilah </i>without a <i>brachah</i>.</p> 
<p>9. Disposable, single-use aluminum pans, according to many opinions do not 
require<i>tevilah</i>. If intended for multiple uses, they do require <i>tevilah
</i>even before their first use.</p> 
<p>10. If one buys a glass bottle of food or drink, this bottle may be reused 
without tevilah (<i>Iggerot Moshe). </i>If the jar is made of metal, some 
authorities require<i>tevilah </i>without a <i>brachah</i>. Metal cans opened 
by a Jew may be reused without<i>tevilah</i>. </p> 
<p>11. Utensils that do not come in direct contact with food do not require 
tevilah. Therefore, oven racks, stove top grates, crock pot shells and can 
openers do not require tevilah. Additionally, utensils that are always lined 
with paper or foil are not obligated.</p> 
<p>12. Electronic appliances, such as urns and grills, require tevilah. In 
many cases, when left to dry properly, it has been demonstrated that contact 
with water is not detrimental.</p> 
<p>13. If one absolutely needs a utensil and for some reason it cannot be <i>
toveled</i>, a Rabbi should be consulted.</p> 
<p><b>Procedure for <i>tevilat keilim</i>:</b></p> 
<p>1. Utensils must be cleaned from any dirt, glue, or residue.</p> 
<p>2. All adhesions such as stickers and labels that are not intended to 
remain on the utensil must be removed.</p> 
<p>3. If the utensil requires kashering then this must be done before <i>
tevilah</i>.</p> 
<p>4. Utensils should be brought to a kosher <i>mikveh </i>(note that not all 
men&rsquo;s<i>mikva&rsquo;ot </i>are kosher for <i>tevilat keilim</i>), or to 
the ocean, sea, or a non-flowing lake.</p> 
<p>5. Rivers and streams are flowing bodies of water. Their permissibility is 
complex and would require a ruling by a Rabbi who is knowledgeable in the laws 
of<i>mikva&rsquo;ot</i> and the properties of the river.</p> 
<p>6. Anyone can do the actual immersion, even a child or a non-Jew. However, 
the tevilah must be done in the presence of a Jewish adult who can verify that 
it was done properly. Additionally, it is not considered correct to have a 
non-Jew do the<i>tevilah </i>if it means that a <i>brachah </i>will not be 
recited.</p> 
<p>7. The entire utensil must be submerged in such a way as to enable water to 
touch all parts of the utensil simultaneously. One must therefore be careful 
that ensures that no air pockets remain. Even one&rsquo;s hand cannot come 
between the water and the utensil. Therefore, either pre-wet your hand so that 
a layer of water separates your hand from the utensil, or submerge the utensils 
in a basket.</p> 
<p>8. One may not pile up dishes and immerse them all at once, since the 
weight of the dishes will block the water.</p> 
<p>9. The brachah, &ldquo;. . . <i>al tevilat kelim</i>,&rdquo; should be 
recited before the<i>tevilah</i>, and one should not talk or do other things 
until all of the toveling has been completed. If one is immersing only one 
utensil then the proper berachah is &ldquo;. . .<i>al tevilat kli</i>&rdquo;.

<h1>Pet Food</h1> 
<p>Since it is forbidden to own or benefit from chametz during Passover, food 
that contains chametz may not be fed to pets. However, it is permitted to give 
pets food that contains kitniyot.<br>
 If one is unable to procure pet food 
that does not contain chametz, some rabbinical authorities allow for a sale, 
which would transfer to a gentile the ownership and responsibility of caring 
for the pet. Ask your Rabbi for guidance.</p> Back to OU Passover Home Page

Additionally, while quinoa is not one of the five grains 
that can create chametz (wheat, oat, barley, spelt and rye), and quinoa is not 
grown in the same vicinity as the grains mentioned above, the processing of 
quinoa is sometimes done at the same location where they process wheat and 
wheat flour. It is highly doubtful that the mills are effectively cleaned 
between grains. The concern of wheat flour or particles finding their way into 
the quinoa flour would be a serious one.</p> Back to OU Passover Home Page

<h1>Gluten Allergies</h1> 
<p>Regretfully, because one can only perform the mitzvah of eating matzot at 
the Seder with a matzah that is made from one of the five varieties of grain 
(barley, wheat, rye, oats, and spelt), eating matzot using any of the other 
flours at are gluten free would still not enable one to fulfill the mitzvah.<br>
 Some people with gluten allergy use either oat matzah or spelt matzah. While 
not completely glutenfree, oat matzah is especially soluble and easy to digest. 
Those with this allergy should discuss the matter with their allergist and 
Rabbi.<br>

 As always, if the performance

reaction, while severe, would not be life-threatening, ask your Rabbi.</p> Back

<h1>Alcoholic Beverages</h1> 
<p>Alcoholic beverages must bear certification to be used for Passover. There 
are numerous issues involving what the alcohol is made from, the equipment it 
is produced in, and the fermentation process itself. We encourage all Kosher 
consumers to find alcoholic beverages with reliable certification or to abstain 
for the eight days of Passover.</p> Back to OU Passover Home Page Print Article 
<h1>Kitniyot Ingredients</h1> 
<p>Why at times can the OU not tell me if something is made from kitnityot?</p>
<p>All products are made from ingredients, and ingredients are often made from 
sub-units. For example, a candy generally contains a flavor, and the flavor may 
be made from as many as 30 ingredients. Some of the ingredients in the flavor 
are made from other ingredients, as well.</p> 
<p>The OU often accepts the certification of other reliable Kashruth agencies 
on ingredients. In such instances, we do not have access to the formula of the 
ingredients. As such, it would not be possible to evaluate the Passover status, 
since we do not know what ingredients are present in the product.</p> 
<p>To use the example of the flavor, it is only possible to determine if a 
flavor is Kosher for Passover if one has the formula which lists the many 
components of the flavor. Thus, only the certifying agency of the flavor would 
be in a position to determine if the flavor is Kosher for Pesach.</p> 
<p>At best, we can suggest the potential existance of Kitniyot or Chametz in a 
product that we do not certify for Passover.</p> 
<p>If you are Sephardi, consume Kitniyot on Pesach, and therefore need a list 
of such products, we recommend that you discuss such questions with a Sephardi 
Rabbi.</p> Back to OU Passover Home Page Print Article 
<h1>Baby Formula</h1> 
<p>Most infant formulas are made from soy products. Use of <i>kitniyot</i> 
does not apply to infants.</p> 
<p>However, you must take care to keep bottles, nipples and formula away from 
the general kitchen area. Any mixing or washing should be done elsewhere, such 
as in the bathroom sink.</p> 
<p>The following products can be assumed to be free of chometz, although they 
may contain<i>kitniyot</i>.</p>

<h1>Wine</h1> 
<p>Please note that not all OU wines are certified for Passover use. </p> 
<p>Some wines, are flavored and colored and may contain Kitniyoth, and 
therefore are not marked for Passover use. The vast majority of OU certified 
wines are OU-P.</p>

<h1>Nutritionals and Dietary Supplements</h1> 
<p><i></i>Nutritional Supplements for Pesach &mdash;5771/2011 </p> 
<p>The products on this list are not certified for Pesach by the OU. Despite 
the OU&rsquo;s best efforts, OU certified manufacturers of nutritional 
supplements have not agreed to special Pesach productions. In an effort to help 
Rabbanim make decisions about nutritional supplements for Pesach the OU has 
identified those products that are halachically acceptable for cholim.</p> 
<p>Please note the following points: </p> 
<p>&bull; Many of the products contain <i>kitniyot </i>and some contain <i>
kitneous</i>as the primary ingredient. <br>
 &bull; Some of the products 
contain ingredients that could be produced from chametz-based raw materials. 
Flavors, for example, can contain components that were fermented from 
wheat-based glucose. Vitamins and citric acid salts such as potassium or sodium 
citrate can also be derived from wheat-based glucose fermentation.<br>
 &bull; 
With the exception of flavors, however, the ingredients that could be made from 
a<i>chametz</i>-based raw material are <i>batel b&rsquo;shishim</i> in any 
given supplement.<br>
 &bull; Even in cases where a given ingredient would not 
be batel &ndash; as in the case of flavors, which are<i>avidah l&rsquo;taimah
</i> &ndash; the majority of world production does not make use of 
chametz-based glucose or other<i>chametz</i>-based ingredients. Furthermore, it 
is difficult and sometimes impossible to determine if such ingredients are<i>
chametz</i>-based. <br>
 &bull; Therefore, the products on this list are 
permitted on Pesach and can be given to someone who is infirm (a<i>cholah 
sh&rsquo;ain bo sakanah</i>). <br>
 &bull; None of these products should be 
provided if a certified alternative is made available.<br>
 &bull; Products 
that contain flavors should only be provided when no unflavored alternative 
exists. Since natural flavors are more likely to contain a chametz-derived 
compound than an artificial flavor, an &ldquo;artificial flavors&rdquo; 
designation on an ingredients label is preferable to &ldquo;natural 
flavors&rdquo; or a &ldquo;natural and artificial flavors&rdquo; designation. 
Most nutritional supplements contain flavors; unflavored products will be 
marked accordingly.<br>
 &bull; Liquid nutritional supplements typically 
contain sensitive ingredients at below bitel proportions. In general liquid 
supplements are preferable to the same product in powder form, which may 
contain sensitive ingredients that may not be batel.<br>
 &bull; Although the 
OU certifies these products year-round, the OU does not always have information 
about the ingredients for these products as they relate to Pesach. In order to 
guarantee that some products are available to the public the OU has researched 
the products on this list. Other products not on the list may also be 
acceptable for Pesach. If a specific product must be reviewed please feel free 
to call the number below.<br>
 &bull; If you have a question about a product 
not on this list, please email the Webbe Rebbe at and we will try to be of 
assistance.</p>

<h1>Coffee</h1> 
<p>All regular ground coffees are acceptable for Passover use when bearing an 
OU.</p> 
<p>All decaffeinated ground coffees require an OU-P to be used on Passover.

<h1>Baby Rice Cereals</h1> 
<p>There is possible <i>chametz </i>in most baby rice cereals, so the OU 
cannot recommend them for Passover use. However, there is no problem owning 
rice and making your own cereal from non-enriched rice over Passover. Enriched 
rice presents<i>choametz </i>concerns.</p> 
<p>One should make the cereal using a special non-Pesach, non-<i>chametz </i>
pot, and this special pot (and any special utensils used for the cereal) should 
not be washed together with the Pesach dishes. You can<i>Kasher </i>a pot 
before Passover and dedicate it for making the rice cereal over Passover.</p> 
<p>Similarly, the grinding of the rice should not be done in a Passover 
grinder on Passover. You can grind the rice in a<b><i>clean </i></b>chametz 
grinder before Passover or purchase a dedicated grinder for use over Passover.
</p> 
<p><b>Sample Recipe: </b><br>
 Rice Cereal <br>
 1. 1/4 c. rice powder [brown 
or white (not enriched) rice ground in blender, food processor, or coffee 
grinder].<br>
 2. 1 cup water. <br>
 3. Bring liquid to boil in saucepan. Add 
the rice powder while stirring constantly.<br>
 4. Simmer covered for 10 
minutes, mix in formula or breast milk and fruits if desired<br>
 5. Serve warm.

<h1>Lactose Intolerant</h1> 
<p>Can I buy Lactaid for Passover?</p> 
<p>Lactaid production is likely to involve chometz. This renders chewable 
lactaid tablets problematic.<br>
 However, our Rabbinical authorities have 
decided that lactaid milk is permissible if purchased before Passover since any 
chometz contained within Lactaid milk would be nullified (batel).</p> 
<p>Lactaid non-chewable tablets are more complicated. Many rabbinical permit 
non-chewable vitamins and supplements without regard to their kashruth status. 
According to such opinions, one may take these tablets just like any other 
non-chewable pill.</p> 
<p>Other rabbinical authorities believe that vitamins and supplements are akin 
to food even when swallowed. According to this opinion one may take the lactaid 
tablet when wrapped in tissue paper. However, one who is unable to do so may 
swallow the tablet without wrapping it, and rely on the lenient authorities, 
since milk is such an important health need.<br>
 We suggest that you consult 
with your local rabbi as to which of these opinions you should follow.</p> 
<p>We certify a number of lactose reduced products for Passover. Please 
consult our Passover product search for more information.</p> Back to OU 
Passover Home Page Print Article 
<h1>Lactose Intolerant</h1> 
<p><b>Lactaid Milk</b></p> 
<p>According to the OU <i>poskim</i>, if one purchases <i>unflavored </i>and 
<i>unenriched </i>lactaid milk before Passover, they can then use it on 
Passover.</p> 
<p><b>Lactaid Pills</b><br>
 Lactaid pills come in two forms &ndash; 
inedible/swallowable and chewable &ndash; which are taken at the same time the 
person begins consuming a dairy product. The lactase used in these products is 
made via a chometz based fermentation process.</p> 
<p>As such, one may definitely not take the chewable pills on Pesach (and we 
think that you should even sell them to a non-Jew or get rid of them).</p> 
<p>However, according to the OU poskim, one can consume the inedible pills. 
</p> 
<p>Nonetheless, one should preferably wrap them in tissue paper before 
swallowing them. But if that&rsquo;s too difficult then one can take them 
&ldquo;as is&rdquo;.</p>

<h1>Are OU-P matzos 18 minute matzos?</h1> 
<p>Are OU matzos 18 minute matzos? It depends on what you mean. We always make 
sure that the entire matzah baking process&mdash;from adding the water to the 
flour until the matzos are done baking&mdash;takes place in less than 18 
minutes.</p> 
<p>If you are asking if we stop the factory after each 18 minute run to clean 
everything, the answer is that we do not. Needless to say, we constantly clean 
all utensils and machinery involved in kneeding and mixing the dough. However, 
other pieces of machinery in the factory does not require cleaning every 
eighteen minutes. Since they are constantly in motion there is no risk of 
anything becoming chometz. Additionally, all particles are blown off. Needless 
to say, we make sure the entire factory is rigorously cleaned at the end of 
each work day.</p> 
<p>Additionally, all OU Matzah that is certified as Kosher for Passover, are 
made<i>l&rsquo;shem mitzvas matzah </i>and the flour is watched from the time 
of grinding.</p> Back to OU Passover Home Page Print Article 
<h1>Salt</h1> 
<p>Salt that is iodized by means of a corn derivative is (<i>kitniyos</i>) and

not require Passover certification, nor does sea salt.</p> Back to OU Passover

<h1>Pesach Recipe Substitutes</h1> 
<p>By: Eileen Goltz</p> 
<p>At some point during Pesach preparations we&rsquo;ve all tried to convert a 
main stream recipe into a Pesach one only to discover that we don&rsquo;t have 
a clue as to what to substitute for a chometz ingredient. This panic moment is 
why I started compiling myCOMPLETE LIST OF PESACH SUBSTITUTES. I&rsquo;ve added 
some great new substitutions this year, thanks to readers who&rsquo;ve sent in 
their own ingenious creations. If anyone has any other substitutions that they 
would like to share please let me () know and I&rsquo;ll attach them to the 
next Pesach article.</p> 
<p>1 oz. baking chocolate (unsweetened chocolate) = 3 tablespoon unsweetened 
cocoa powder plus 1 tablespoon oil or melted margarine</p> 
<p>16 oz. semi-sweet chocolate = 6 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder plus 
1/4 cup oil and 7 tablespoon granulated sugar</p> 
<p>14 oz. sweet chocolate (German-type) = 3 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa 
powder plus 2 2/3 tablespoon oil and 4 1/2 tablespoon granulated sugar<br>
 1 
cup confectioners&rsquo; sugar = 1 cup granulated sugar minus 1 tablespoon 
sugar plus 1 tablespoon potato starch pulsed in a food processor or blender<br>

 1 cup sour milk or buttermilk for dairy baking = 1 tablespoon lemon juice in a 
1 cup measure, then fill to 1 cup with Passover nondairy creamer. Stir and 
steep 5 minutes</p> 
<p>Butter in baking or cooking use pareve Passover margarine in equal amounts. 
Use a bit less salt</p> 
<p>1 cup honey = 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar plus 1/4 cup water </p> 
<p>1 cup corn syrup = 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar plus 1/3 cup water, boiled 
until syrupy</p> 
<p>1 cup vanilla sugar = 1 cup granulated sugar with 1 split vanilla bean left 
for at least 24 hours in a tightly covered jar</p> 
<p>1 cup of flour, substitute 5/8 cup matzo cake meal or potato starch, or a 
combination sifted together</p> 
<p>1 tablespoon flour = 1/2 tablespoon potato starch </p> 
<p>1 cup corn starch = 7/8 cup potato starch </p> 
<p>1 teaspoon cream of tarter= 1 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice or 1 1/2 teaspoon 
vinegar</p> 
<p>1 cup graham cracker crumbs = 1 cup ground cookies or soup nuts plus 1 
teaspoon cinnamon</p> 
<p>1 cup bread crumbs = 1 cup matzo meal </p> 
<p>1 cup matzo meal = 3 matzoth ground in a food processor </p> 
<p>1 cup matzoth cake meal = 1 cup plus 2 tablespoon matzo meal finely ground 
in a blender or food processor and sifted</p> 
<p>3 crumbled matzo = 2 cups matzo farfel </p> 
<p>1 cup (8 oz.) cream cheese = 1 cup cottage cheese pureed with 1/2 stick 
butter or margarine</p> 
<p>Chicken fat or gribenes = 2 caramelized onions, Saute 2 sliced onions in 2 
tablespoon oil and 2 tablespoons sugar. Cook until the onions are soft. Puree 
the onions once they are golden.</p> 
<p>1 cup milk (for baking) = 1 cup water plus 2 tablespoon margarine, or 1/2 
cup fruit juice plus 1/2 cup water</p> 
<p>1 1/4 cup sweetened condensed milk =1 cup instant nonfat dry milk, 2/3 cup 
sugar, 1/3 cup boiling water and 3 tablespoons margarine. Blend all the 
ingredients until smooth. To thicken, let set in the refrigerator for 24 hours.
</p> 
<p>1 cup wine= 13 tablespoons water, 3 tablespoons lemon juice and 1 
tablespoon sugar. Mix together and let set for 10 minutes.</p> 
<p>For frying: Instead of chicken fat, use combination of olive oil or 
vegetable oil and 1 to 2 tablespoons pareve Passover margarine.</p> 
<p>Eggs: Passover egg substitutes don&rsquo;t work quite as well as the 
chometz egg substitutes. For kugels, matzo balls, fried matzo and some cakes 
the recipes will probably be ok. However, if you want to avoid them (and I do) 
you can add one extra egg white and 1/2 teaspoon of vegetable oil for each yolk 
eliminated when baking. Use only egg whites as the dipping to coat and fry 
meats.</p> 
<p>Italian Seasoning= 1/4 teaspoon EACH dried oregano leaves, dried marjoram 
leaves and dried basil leaves plus 1/8 teaspoon rubbed dried sage. This can be 
substituted for 1 1/2 teaspoons Italian seasoning.</p> 
<p>Curry Powder= 2 tablespoons ground coriander, 1 tablespoon black pepper, 2 
tablespoons red pepper, 2 tablespoons turmeric, 2 tablespoons ground ginger. 
Makes 2/3 cup.</p> 
<p>Pancake syrup=use fruit jelly, not jam and add a little water to thin. I 
always like to combine the jelly and water in a microwave safe bowl and heat it 
gently before I serve it.</p> 
<p>Seasoned Rice Wine Vinegar= 3 tablespoons white vinegar, 1 tablespoon white 
wine, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt. Mix to combine. Makes 1/4 cup<br>
 
Flavored Vinegar= lemon juice in cooking or salad, grapefruit juice in salads, 
wine in marinades.</p> 
<p>Water Chestnuts- substitute raw jicama</p> 
<p>Orange liqueur =substitute an equal amount of frozen orange juice 
concentrate<br>
 You can mince the tops of green onions and use them in recipes 
that call for chives or use celery tops instead of parsley (who are we kidding, 
we always have parsley during Pesach)</p> Back to OU Passover Home Page Print

<h1>A Summary of Halachos for Erev Pesach Shechol B&rsquo;Shabbos - 5768</h1> 
<p>By: Rabbi Yaakov Luban</p> 
<p><b>&bull; As is always the case in halacha, there are divergent opinions 
among Poskim. In the following summary, I have presented a set of practical 
recommendations based on mainstream positions. Individuals should consult with 
their local Rabbis for specific direction.</b></p> <b> </b> 
<p><b>&bull; The times listed in this summary are sho&rsquo;os zemanios, and 
they must be converted into standard times of the day. I have not done that 
because the times vary from city to city. Once again, one should consult with 
the local Rabbi.</b></p> 
<p>1. Ta&rsquo;anis Bechorim (fast of the firstborn) occurs on Thursday, April 
17. The traditional siyum will be Thursday morning after davening.</p> 
<p>2. Bedikas Chometz is performed Thursday evening. A bracha is recited 
before the bedika, and bitul chametz (kol chamira) is recited after the bedika.
</p> 
<p>3. Although chometz can be eaten until Shabbos morning, all chometz 
remaining after the bedika should be placed in a secure and designated area. 
Chometz should be eaten with care, and all crumbs must be swept and discarded.
</p> 
<p>4. Biur Chometz (burning the chometz) is done Friday morning before the end 
of the 5th hour (If one forgets, it can be burned until Shabbos.) Bitul Chametz 
(kol chamira) is not recited at this time.</p> 
<p>5. Chometz is sold Friday morning before the end of the 5th hour. Please 
appoint your Rabbi as your agent beforehand.</p> 
<p>6. Utensils can be kashered for Pesach all day Friday.</p> 
<p>7. The challah used for hamotzi on Shabbos should be eaten at a non-Pesach 
table, or over the floor. It is best to eat over a wooden or tile floor, which 
can be swept. (Carpets may not be swept on Shabbos.) When finished, the 
tablecloth must be shaken out and put away with the chometz utensils. The floor 
should be swept and the broom should be shaken over a toilet.</p> 
<p>8. One may eat chometz on Shabbos morning until the end of the 4th hour.</p>
<p>9. Chometz must be removed from one&rsquo;s property by Shabbos morning, 
the end of the 5th hour. Crumbs and small pieces of challah should be flushed 
down the toilet. Chometz in garbage bags must be removed from garbage pails and 
placed off one&rsquo;s property on the side of the curb before the end of the 
5th hour.</p> 
<p>10. After cleaning up all chometz, bitul chometz (kol chamira) is recited 
before the end of the 5th hour Shabbos morning.</p> 
<p>11. After the end of the 5th hour, chometz is muktzah and may not be moved. 
If by any chance chometz remains in the house, it must be covered and burned on 
chol hamoed (Monday evening).</p> 
<p>12. Regular matzoh (as opposed to egg matzoh) should not be eaten the 
entire Shabbos. Either challah or egg matzoh may be used for the Shabbos meal 
at night and in the morning. According to Ashkenazic custom, egg matzoh should 
not be eaten later than the end of the 4th hour Shabbos morning. In addition, 
egg matzoh should not be eaten on Pesach plates or tablecloths. However, egg 
matzoh is not chometz and may be kept in the home.</p> 
<p>13. At least a k&rsquo;beitzah (volume of an egg) of bread or egg matzoh 
must be eaten at each meal.</p> 
<p>14. One may eat challah outside in the yard and the remainder of the meal 
indoors, or the challah may be eaten indoors in one area and the meal completed 
in another area. If the two areas are not in sight of one another, kiddush and 
birkas hamazon must be recited where the challah was eaten.</p> 
<p>15. It is preferable to eat three Shabbos meals with bread. Therefore, the 
morning meal should be divided into two parts. One should make kiddush, 
hamotzi, eat one course and recite birchas hamazon. After a distinct 
interruption (such as taking a walk or learning) one washes again for hamotzi 
and completes the third meal. The morning meals must be completed by the end of 
the 4th hour.</p> 
<p>16. For a variety of reasons, it is preferable to cook and eat the Shabbos 
meal in Pesach utensils. Obviously, with the exception of the challah, the food 
would be kosher for Pesach.</p> 
<p>17. After eating challah or egg matzoh, one should wash his hands and rinse 
his mouth in a bathroom sink before eating the remainder of the meal with 
Pesach utensils. One may also use a dry toothbrush without water.</p> 
<p>18. After six and one-half hours (mincha gedolah) one should eat meat, fish 
or fruit to fulfill the mitzvah of shalosh seudos, since it is a matter of 
dispute if shalosh seudos can be fulfilled in the morning. However, one should 
not eat a large meal that would diminish his appetite at the Seder.</p> 
<p>19. During Shabbos, matzoh and baked foods containing matzoh, such as 
Pesach cake and cookies may not be eaten. Those who eat gebrukts may eat 
knaidlach (which are cooked in liquid) the entire Shabbos until the end of the 
9th hour.</p> 
<p>20. Preparations for the Seder may not be done on Shabbos. Even setting the 
table for the Seder is not permissible.</p> 
<p>21. It is permissible to sleep on Shabbos to be more alert for the Seder, 
but one should not say that this is the purpose of his sleeping.</p> 
<p>22. The zeroah (shank bone) and roasted egg should be prepared before 
Shabbos. If one forgot, they may be prepared Motzei Shabbos provided that they 
are eaten on Sunday during the daytime (they cannot be eaten at the seder since 
we do not eat roasted food at the seder). One cannot prepare a zeroah or 
roasted egg on Motzei Shabbos for the second Seder. Rather, a second set is 
prepared Sunday night and eaten Monday.</p> 
<p>23. Charoses should be prepared before Shabbos. If one forgot, it may be 
prepared on Motzei Shabbos, but the grinding and chopping must be done with a 
shinui (done in a different manner than usual, such as the grater being turned 
upside down, or the pieces allowed to fall on a table rather than a plate). One 
may not prepare Motzei Shabbos for the second Seder.</p> 
<p>24. Some rabbinic authorities recommend grating horseradish before Shabbos, 
and storing it in a sealed container. The Vilna Gaon on the other hand required 
its preparation on Motzei Shabbos. The grating must be done with a shinui (see 
23 above). One may only prepare enough for that Seder.</p> 
<p>25. It is preferable to prepare salt water before Shabbos, but if not, it 
can be made Motzei Shabbos.</p> Back to OU Passover Home Page Print Article 
<h1>Erev Pesach on Shabbat</h1> 
<p>By: Rabbi Alfred Cohen</p> 
<p>From the Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society</p> 
<p>Probably the busiest and most hectic day of the year in every Jewish 
household is Erev Pesach, the day preceding Passover, for it entails getting 
rid of the last smidgen of chametz as well as preparing for the Seder. 
Moreover, it is a day during most of which one may not eat chametz, yet matzoh 
is likewish forbidden, straining the ingenuity of the food preparer.</p> 
<p>This year there will be an added complication, as this year erev Pesach 
occurs on the Sabbath, which has requirements and restrictions of its own. This 
paper will explore the problems which may arise from these dual requirements 
and advance various solutions.</p> 
<p>Before we begin, let us note the happy circumstance that the additional 
complication of observing the Sabbath on this so-busy day prior to Pesach 
brings with it some unexpected rewards: Having spent the day before Pesach 
resting, and refreshed by the Sabbath tranquility, all will be able to 
participate in the Seder at night with true appreciation.</p> 
<p>Eating Chametz</p> 
<p>As noted, for most of Erev Pesach it is forbidden to eat bread (chametz), 
and yet matzoh is also not allowed. The Shulchan Aruch rules that &ldquo;it is 
forbidden to eat bread [on erev Pesach] from the tenth hour and on. How then 
can we fulfill the Sabbath obligation to partake of three meals, each of which 
is accompanied by two loaves of &ldquo;bread&rdquo;? Whether the 
&ldquo;bread&rdquo; be chametz or matzoh, when can it be eaten?</p> 
<p>There are a number of ways to meet this requirement. We can suggest a few, 
all of which have variations and permutations, briefly summarized as follows: 
We can eat challah at all three meals; we can use egg matzoh for all the meals; 
we can use challah Friday night and early Shabbat morning, and egg matzoh for 
the third meal in the afternoon; or (if we don&rsquo;t want to use egg matzoh), 
we can use challah Friday night and early Shabbat morning, and skip the third 
meal. As we shall see, each of these solutions has its own problem, yet there 
are various reasons to recommend each one.</p> 
<p>Using Chametz</p> 
<p>One solution is to get up very early, daven, and then before the tenth 
hour, eat a meal at which two loaves of bread or challah are served. Indeed, 
this is the counsel of the Shulchan Aruch:</p> 
<p>When erev Pesach occurs on Shabbat, we search the<br>
 house [for chametz] 
on the 13th [Thursday night] and<br>
 destroy all [chametz] before Shabbat, but 
we leave over<br>
 food for two meals which are required on Shabbat,<br>
 but 
the time for the third meal is after Mincha [and,<br>
 as we shall see, there 
is a halachic problem in eating<br>
 a meal after Mincha before the Seder].</p> 
<p>Although this scenario takes care of the problem of having a meal on 
Shabbat with two breads, it does introduce the problem of getting rid of 
chametz on Shabbat. The usual ways of disposing of chametz, by burning or by 
sale, cannot be employed on Shabbat. Large pieces of chametz which are 
difficult to destroy may be given to a non-Jew or else deposited in the garbage 
by a non-Jew. Cleaning the dishes and putting them away is also a problem. In a 
modern vein, Rav Sternbuch has suggested that it would be desirable to use 
paper or plastic dishes which could be discarded after the meal, thus obviating 
the need to get the regular dishes clean on Shabbat and put them away.</p> 
<p>If for some reason, none of these options is feasible, the person should 
declare he is disowning any remaining chametz, cover it so that it is not 
visible, and burn it on Chol Hamoed.</p> 
<p>It is a mitzvah to eat warm foods on Shabbat, but the Shulchan Aruch warns 
that one should be careful not to cook chametz foods which will stick to the 
pot, since it will not be possible to clean it properly before Pesach. Further 
nuances at this unusual meal include serving cold food which won&rsquo;t stick, 
so that it will not be necessary to scrape out the plates or pot. Then, later 
in the day, one can fulfill the mitzvah of eating warm food by eating food 
cooked in Passover utensils, on dishes which will be utilized for the rest of 
the Passover holiday. According to the Mishnah Berurah, this is the way they 
used to do it in Europe.</p> 
<p>Some of these practices are minor, but others involve severe biblical 
infractions. Rav Ovadia Yosef records that what to do on this Shabbat has long 
been a problem; an earlier rabbi of Alexandria, Egypt, had already bemoaned the 
mistakes arising out of ignorance, when<br>
 &hellip; Erev Pesach fell on the 
Sabbath, and how much<br>
 anguish I have in my heart at the prohibitions and
<br> errors that occurred on this Sabbath due to the eating<br>
 of chametz, 
because they were unable to be careful<br>
 properly concerning crumbs of 
chametz and cleaning<br>
 the house and the like, aside from the lack of Sabbath
<br> joy, inasmuch as they had to eat between the oven<br>
 and the stove; 
furthermore, many were late in reciting<br>
 the prayers on Shabbat, and it is 
possible that they ate<br>
 after the time when it is prohibited.</p> 
<p>There are those who advise being scrupulous to rinse out the mouth very 
well, so that no chametz remains.</p> 
<p>What about false teeth? Rav Ovadia Yosef sees little reason to do anything 
special with the teeth: since the food that one eats is not hot enough to be a 
problem halachically (otherwise he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to take it into his 
mouth) and since the teeth are not porous, little more than cleaning them well 
is required. In an aside, he wryly mentions an individual who was unwilling to 
accept this lenient ruling and proceeded to deposit his false teeth in boiling 
water to &ldquo;kasher&rdquo; them &ndash; cracking them, and making it 
impossible for him to eat all Pesach! However, Chok Leyisrael does take a 
stricter view of the matter.</p> 
<p>Using Matzoh<br>
 One way to avoid all the problems attendant upon using 
chametz at the meal is simply to use matzoh for lechem mishneh. But the 
Jerusalem Talmud denigrates a person who eats matzoh on the day before Pesach 
&ldquo;as if he had relations with his fiancee in his father-in-law&rsquo;s 
house.&rdquo; Does that mean that it is forbidden to eat matzoh during the 
entire day? What is the law? Actually, there are three opinions as to when the 
prohibition of eating matzoh begins:</p> 
<p>(A) From Six Hours and On. This time limit coincides with the time when 
eating chametz is forbidden on erev Pesach. In effect, whenever I may not eat 
chametz, I may also not eat matzoh. If we accept this understanding of the 
rule, it would be permitted to use matzoh at the Friday night meal and also for 
the meal (or meals) very early on the morning of the Sabbath, but not for a 
meal later in the day.</p> 
<p>(B) The Entire Day. This view holds that for the entire 24-hour period 
before Pesach, eating matzoh is precluded.20 In this case, we could not use 
matzoh at any of the Sabbath meals before Pesach. The Magen Avraham considers 
this to be the proper view.</p> 
<p>&copy; During the Day Only. Although one could use matzoh on Friday night, 
it would not be permissible any time during the daylight hours.&rdquo; Many 
accept this as the proper rule to follow.</p> 
<p>In point of fact, R. Moshe Feinstein forbids eating matzoh during the day 
of erev Pesach and discourages its use even for the Friday night meal 
preceding. However, he cautions that one should not reprimand someone who does 
employ the matzoh option on Friday evening. Furthermore, if there is cause for 
concern that by using chametz on Friday night and Shabbat morning it will raise 
serious difficulty in removing all the chametz properly before Pesach (in a 
hospital, for example), one may certainly use egg matzoh throughout the day of 
erev Pesach and recite all the usual blessings thereon.<br>
 In addition to 
these strictly halachic criteria, there are also certain customs which are 
observed by many: some people stop eating matzoh from the beginning of the 
month of Nissan, while others stop after Purim. However, no custom can ever be 
instituted which would have the effect of barring performance of a mitzvah. 
Therefore, if there were no other way for them to carry out the requirement to 
have three meals with lechem mishneh on this Shabbat, these persons, too, could 
use matzoh.</p> 
<p>Which Matzoh Is Forbidden</p> 
<p>Considering the opposition of Chazal to eating matzoh before the proper 
time, it becomes essential to define precisely what qualifies as 
&ldquo;matzoh&rdquo; under the rubric of halacha. In the context of the 
rabbinic dictum, it is clear that only that product which is worthy to be eaten 
at the Seder is included in the category of matzoh which may not be eaten on 
the day preceding Pesach. The only matzoh which can be used at the Seder to 
fulfill the mitzvah of matzoh is &ldquo;a poor man&rsquo;s bread&rdquo; &ndash; 
flat bread which is made from a mixture of flour and water only. If juice or 
eggs are added to or substituted for the water in the mix, it is called 
&ldquo;matzoh ashira&rdquo; (egg matzoh), and is not suitable for the Seder. 
Similarly, plain matzoh which has subsequently been cooked or fried does not 
qualify for the mitzvah of &ldquo;matzoh&rdquo; at the Seder. Thus, all these, 
which are technically not &ldquo;matzoh&rdquo; according to the halacha, are 
exempt from the stricture against eating matzoh on erev Pesnch. Accordingly, 
egg matzoh could be used for Lechem Mishneh, the two breads at the Sabbath 
meals. There is a halachic difficulty attendant upon using egg matzohs as the 
two loaves of bread required for the meals on Shabbat: According to many 
rabbis, egg matzoh cannot technically be classified as &ldquo;bread&rdquo; 
requiring washing the hands, reciting the blessing hamotzi, and followed by 
birkat hamazon, since unlike real matzoh, it is made with eggs and/or juice 
instead of just plain water with the flour. Nevertheless, even if egg matzoh is 
not &ldquo;bread&rdquo; within the definition of the term, it can still take 
the place of bread at a meal, provided that it is used instead of bread and 
that a sufficient amount is &lsquo;consumed&rsquo; This is the rule any time 
cake, crackers, or any baked goods are eaten in sufficient quantity to qualify 
as a meal. How much egg matzoh is required so that it can substitute for real 
bread? Here, there is a difference of opinion among the poskim: ( a) Some say 
that &ldquo;one who eats a volume of cake equal to four (or three) eggs 
&hellip; must treat the cake as bread.&rdquo; (b) There are those who 
&ldquo;conclude that the amount of one meal equals somewhat more than the 
volume of twenty-one eggs,&rdquo; and only someone who eats this equivalent of 
cake should recite hamotzi. &copy; Most poskim, however, reject both these 
opinions, one as being too meager, the other as being far too large. In their 
opinion, cake or egg matzoh &ldquo;is measured in terms of the quantity that is 
generally eaten during the course of a full This is the opinion of Rav Moshe 
Feinstein and most other poskim.</p> 
<p>According to some authorities, another type of matzoh which might be 
considered permitted for use on Erev Pesach is matzoh which is not matzo shmura 
The reasoning here is that since at the Seder we must use matzoh shmura, any 
other type of matzoh is disqualified and consequently could not have been 
intended by the rabbis castigating those who eat matzoh on erev Pesach. In 
summation, Rav Ovadia Yosef, whose decisions are generally accepted by 
Sephardic Jews, rules that&hellip; it is proper to destroy the chametz before 
Shabbat &hellip; and to use for Shabbat only utensils that are fit for Pesach 
&hellip; and on Shabbat to use only food and utensils reserved for Pesach, and 
one should fulfill the precept of meals for Shabbat with matzoh which is cooked 
in chicken or meat soup, in the following manner: after the food is wholly 
cooked, let him remove it from the fire,and while the food in the pot is still 
extremely hot, let him put into the pot several pieces of matzoh, as much as he 
needs, in such a way that the matzoh thoroughly soaks up the flavor of the 
food, and then he can use this to fulfill the mitzvah of three meals.</p> 
<p>He prefers the use of re-cooked or fried matzoh to egg matzoh, since the 
halacha is not clear as to how much egg matzoh must be eaten for the blessing 
hamotzi and for Grace after Meals.</p> 
<p>However, if one decides to adopt the option of using egg matzoh as the 
&ldquo;bread at the three meals on that Shabbat, which is an option permitted 
or even suggested by some,34 it is evident that this would solve the problem 
for all three meals; furthermore, it would not be necessary to get up early to 
daven so as to eat chametz before the time when it is no longer permitted.</p> 
<p>Seudah Shelishit<br>
 Till now, we have discussed the ways in which it is 
possible to meet the requirement to eat the first two meals on Shabbat &ndash; 
the one on Friday night and the one on Shabbat morning. As for the third meal, 
that has its own unique questions.</p> 
<p>Mishnah Berurah raises the option of dividing the early morning meal 
(before the tenth hour) into two, by making a blessing on two challahs of 
bread, eating, reciting Grace, then washing again, eating from another two 
challahs, and reciting Grace again.35 This solution, although ingenious, may 
not be halachically feasible. First of all, the third meal of Shabbat should 
really be eaten after Mincha. Secondly, it is questionable whether it is 
permitted to break up what is essentially one meal by reciting birkat hamazon 
and then immediately washing and making another blessing on bread. This may be 
a case of beracha she-aina tzericha, reciting blessings for no reason, which is 
quite a serious matter. There would have to be an interval between the end of 
one meal and the beginning of the next. Considering that we are very pressed 
for time so early on the morning of erev Pesach, leaving a sufficient interval 
between these two early meals may be problematic. Thirdly, it may be possible 
to dispense with bread altogether and fulfill the requirements of the third 
meal by eating something else:<br>
 [The third meal] has to be eaten with 
&ldquo;bread&rdquo;, but there are those who say that one can make the meal 
with those things which accompany bread, such as meat or fish, but not with 
fruit. And there are those who say that one can make [the meal] out of fruit. 
But the first opinion is the major one, i.e., that one should make a meal with 
bread unless he is too full, or in a situation where it is impossible for him 
to eat bread, such as on erev Pesach which comes out on Shabbat, when it is 
forbidden for him to eat bread after Mincha.</p> 
<p>The Mishnah Berurah, Orach Chaim, maintains that it is preferable to eat 
one meal that really satisfies the hunger, and is a true meal, rather than 
breaking up the meal into two. However, other authorities, including the Vilna 
Gaon, advise that the early morning meal should be interrupted and followed by 
another</p> 
<p>It is the decision of the Shulchan Aruch that for the third meal, one 
should use egg matzohs for the two loaves. But the Ramo does not permit this 
choice for Ashkenazi Jews, opting instead for a meal without bread of any type:
</p> 
<p>In our [Ashkenazi] countries, where it is our custom not to eat matzoh 
ashira &hellip; one should fulfill [the obligation to have] a third meal with 
various types of fruit or with meat and fish.</p> 
<p>This ruling by the Ramo is the source of considerable discussion among the 
rabbis. Here he categorically rejects the option of using egg matzoh, yet, when 
the Shulchan Aruch, as quoted above, suggests that on erev Pesach which falls 
on Shabbat, it might be a good idea to use egg matzoh &ndash; the Ramo makes no 
demurrer! In the face of conflicting directives by this major posek, many 
authorities conclude that the Ramo means to be strict about egg matzoh only for 
Pesach itself, and not on erev Pesach!&rsquo; It is a custom to recite the 
Torah portion dealing with the Paschal sacrifice at the conclusion of this 
third meal.42</p> 
<p>Handling the Matzoh</p> 
<p>If a person decides to use regular challah for the meal, but is afraid that 
he will be unable to consume the entire two loaves (and have difficulty 
disposing of them on Shabbat), he might want to employ the option of 
substituting a well-wrapped matzoh instead of the second loaf of challah. 
Indeed, this is the advice given by the Chazon Ish. 43 This would seem to 
present a good solution &ndash; except that we possibly run into the problem of 
muktza.</p> 
<p>Muktza may not be moved on Shabbat. Generally, something is considered 
muktza if it cannot or will not be used on Shabbat (for example, a 
carpenter&rsquo;s hammer, a telephone). Can we use matzoh for the second bread 
at the meal on Shabbat, when on this Shabbat we are certainly not allowed ta 
eat matzoh? The rabbis make an interesting distinction in this regard: matzoh 
shmura, which is what people will be eating at night at the Seder, is certainly 
muktza on the Shabbat of ereu Pesach. However, regular matzoh can be given to a 
young child to eat even today, and therefore it is not muktza; it can be moved, 
it can be placed on the table and subsequently removed.44</p> 
<p>Setting the Table For the Seder</p> 
<p>On a Sabbath or Festival, it is not permitted to make any preparation for 
after the Sabbath, even if it will be a Festival at night. Therefore, one 
should not set the table for the Seder nor make any other preparations until 
the conclusion of Shabbat. However, the Shulchan Aruch45 makes an exception on 
Shernini Atzeret, which is the last day people eat in the succah. The next day 
is Simchat Torah, and the Shulchan Aruch permits removal of utensils from the 
succah on Shemini Atzeret, to be brought into the house. The Ramo cautions that 
although the utensils may be brought in from the succah, the table should not 
be set in the house until after nightfall.</p> 
<p>Why does the halacha permit removing objects from the succah, when it 
appears that it is in preparation for using them in the house on the next day? 
According to the Chayei Adam, this is only a concession because it would be 
very difficult to clean up the succah at night, in the dark. Furthermore, if 
one has not completed the preparations, it is not considered preparing. 
Apparently, it is permitted to do anything which will be very difficult to 
undertake later on (for exam~le, the wine is in the cellar, which is very 
dark). Not only that: but if bringing in the utensils from the succah or the 
wine from the cellar will make the house look sloppy, it would even be 
permissible to put them away in their proper place. This is not done in 
preparation for the next day but in honor of the Sabbath itself.</p> 
<p>Although there are some lenient opinions, most rabbis do not permit one to 
change into clothing for the Seder on Shabbat. But having a non-Jew set the 
table for the Seder is permitted.</p> 
<p>The Seder Plate</p> 
<p>In the special situation when erev Pesach occurs on Shabbat, all 
preparations for the Seder should be completed on Friday. Since Ashkenazim do 
not actually eat the egg and the shankbone on Pesach (since they are roasted), 
they should also be prepared before Shabbat, not on the holiday. However, if 
one forgot, they should be roasted on Saturday night and eaten during the day 
on Sunday. And if one forgot to make the charoset, it may be done on Saturday 
night, albeit with a shinui (modification of technique). Somewhat different is 
the case of marror, for we do not want it to lose its bitter taste; therefore, 
we make it on Saturday night, with a shinui?&rsquo; or else make it on Friday 
and store it in a sealed container.</p> 
<p>Bedikat chametz</p> 
<p>When erev Pesach falls on Shabbat, we search the house for chametz on 
Thursday evening, since we are not able to go around with a candle on Friday 
night. What if one forgot to do it on Thursday? It has been suggested that one 
should do it on Friday night, having a non-Jew carry the candle. But others 
object, claiming that the person will be so concerned lest a fire begin, he 
will not have his mind on searching for chametz properly. Therefore, Rav Braun 
rules that he should just not do the search; undoubtedly, the house has been 
thoroughly cleaned and checked already.</p> 
<p>Fast of The Firstborn</p> 
<p>In remembrance of their miraculous salvation when all the firstborn of 
Egypt were smitten, it is the practice for the firstborn to fast on erev Pesach 
. What is to be done this year, since they cannot fast on Shabbat? Terumat 
Hadeshen and Maharil rule that the fast should be observed on the previous 
Thursday, but others maintain that since the fast is only a custom, and the 
custom cannot be observed on the proper day &ndash; it should not be done at 
all. In citing this law, the Shulchan Aruch records both opinions:<br>
 If erev 
Pesach occurs on Shabbat, there are those who say that the firstborn should 
fast on Thursday, and there are those say that they do not fast at all.</p> 
<p>It is interesting to note that, in a departure from the established 
practice of Sephardic Jews to follow the second option when two are listed, in 
this case Rav Ovadia Yosef rules that the firstborn should fast on Thursday. 
For Ashkenazim, Rav Moshe Feinstein has issued the same ruling based on the Ramo
</p> 
<p>Working on Friday</p> 
<p>In general, it is forbidden to go to work after midday on any erev Pesach. 
Two reasons are given for this stricture: (1) to prepare for the Festival and 
(2) this is the time when the paschal sacrifice was brought, which makes it a 
holy time, when work is forbidden. If we accept the first reason as the true 
rationale, then going to work should be forbidden on Friday afternoon in our 
case, since that is the time one should prepare for Pesach. However, if the 
second reason is really the central one, there would be no reason to desist 
from work on<br>
 Friday &ndash; the paschal lamb was sacrificed on erev Pesach 
even when it was a Sabbath. Thus, no special restrictions attend Friday 
afternoon. Following this second line of thought, Rav Yosef permits work on 
Friday afternoon.</p> 
<p>There is one mitzvah of erev Pesach which we have not discussed in this 
paper &ndash; how the Passover lamb was sacrificed if it occurred on a Shabbat. 
Unfortunately, this is one mitzvah of Pesach which we do not yet have the 
zichirat of experiencing. May the Redeemer come speedily and bring us all back 
to our glorious Temple, where we will be able to fulfill this as well as all 
the other mitzvot of Pesach, the Festival of our Redemption.</p> Back to OU

<p>A Few Hints For Pesach Cleaning</p> 
<p>1. START EARLY &ndash; If you begin right after Purim and do a little bit 
every day, the job is not overwhelming.</p> 
<p>2. Start with areas where chametz does not usually go and declare them off 
limits until Pesach.</p> 
<p>3. Start buying Pesach staples early. Have a place ready to store them.</p> 
<p>4. For the last week before Pesach, indulge in convenience foods and paper 
plates.</p> 
<p>5. Clean the oven as early as possible and use only stove top or toaster 
oven until Pesach. They are well worth the price for ease and speed in food 
preparation.</p> 
<p>6. Check with your Rabbi for instructions to Kasher the microwave.</p> 
<p>7. Invest in a food processor and electric hand-mixer for Pesach. They are 
well worth the price for ease and speed in food preparation.</p> 
<p>8. Aluminum foil is a great help on Pesach &ndash; it can cover counters, 
shelves etc. as well as wrap cooked foods.</p> 
<p>9. Don&rsquo;t forget to clean brooms, vacuum cleaners, clothing pockets, 
car and garage.</p> 
<p>10. Be sure to consult your OU Pesach Directory &ndash; there are new 
products every year to enhance your holiday.<br>

<h1>Selected Halachot of Erev Pesach when it falls on Shabbat</h1> 
<p>By: Rabbi Herschel Billet (Young Israel of Woodmere)</p>This article is not 
meant to be the final arbiter. If you have any questions, please consult a 
competent halachic authority. Provided by the Orthodox Union's Department of 
Synagogue Services.<br>
<br>
 Fast of the firstborn males: Since one is 
prohibited to fast on Shabbat, the firstborn should fast on Thursday. The 12th 
of Nisan. The fast is not held on Friday to avoid entering Shabbat feeling 
uncomfortable because of the fast. Immediately following the fast on Thursday 
evening, those firstborn responsible for searching for &ldquo;chametz&rdquo; 
who are able to make the search without eating should do so. If not, they 
should either have a light bite of fruit or other food of which people do not 
usually make a meal, or they should appoint others to make the search for them 
so they may eat a regular meal. Those firstborn who exempt themselves from the 
fast by participating in a &ldquo;seudat mitzvah&rdquo; are not exempt from the 
prohibition against eating before the search for &ldquo;chametz&rdquo;.<br>
<br>
 The Search For Chametz: The search for chametz takes place on Thursday night 
(the eve of the 13th of Nisan) at the exact time and under the exact same 
circumstances it normally takes place on the eve of the 14th of Nisan in other 
years. One starts the search immediately with nightfall (&ldquo;tzayt 
Hakochavim&rdquo;- appearance of the stars) on Thursday night. The blessing for 
the search is recited as well as the text for voiding the chametz (&ldquo;bitul 
chametz&rdquo; ) which follows. The chametz should then be placed in a safe 
place until the appropriate time for burning it the next day.<br>
<br>
 
DESTRUCTION OF THE CHAMETZ (&ldquo;BI&rsquo;UR CHAMETZ&rdquo; ): It is 
preferred that one burn the chametz on Friday before midday 
(&ldquo;chatzot&rdquo; ) as one normally does on erev Pesach in other years. 
One should not void the chametz after the destruction of the chametz since he 
will still be eating chametz for the rest of Friday and during part of Shabbat. 
The final voiding of chametz (&ldquo;bitul&rdquo; ) should take place on 
Shabbat, erev Pesach.<br>
<br>
 FOOD FOR SHABBAT: One should leave enough bread 
for two meals on Shabbat. Those who wish to follow the opinion, which states 
that if necessary one can eat the third Shabbat meal before midday should leave 
enough bread for three meals. There should be enough whole loaves or rolls to 
have &ldquo;lechem mishnah&rdquo; for two or three meals. One may also leave 
bread for eating on Friday after the time of &ldquo;bi&rsquo;ur chametz&rdquo;. 
If desired, one may burn all the bread on Friday in order to avoid possible 
errors on Shabbat. In that case, one should prepare egg matzah (&ldquo;matzah 
ashirah&rdquo; ) for the &ldquo;lechem mishnah&rdquo; to be eaten at the 
Shabbat meals which take place before the time when chametz becomes prohibited.
<br> <br>
 COOKING FOR SHABBAT <br>
 1. One may prepare food for Shabbat in 
pots used for chametz. One should be careful, however, not to prepare chametz 
food which will stick to the pot and which will be hard to remove without 
scrubbing on Shabbat.<br>
<br>
 2. It is therefore advisable to prepare 
non-chametz food in pots used for Pesach. One should remove this food with a 
new serving utensil and then transfer the food to a chametz pot for serving.<br>
<br> 3. Some authorities are strict in their application of the law 
(&ldquo;machmir&rdquo; ) and say that one should be careful not to pour hot 
liquids from a Pesach pot in which they were cooked (&ldquo;kli rishon&rdquo; ) 
directly into a chametz pot.<br>
<br>
 4. If one wishes to follow the opinion 
stated above regarding total removal of all chametz on Friday then one should 
cook all the meals in Pesach pots and use only Pesach dishes since there is no 
longer any chametz left in the house.<br>
<br>
 THE SHABBAT MEALS AND THE 
&ldquo;TWO LOAVES&rdquo; (&ldquo;Lechem Mishna&rdquo;)<br>
 1. Each of the 
three meals that one is required to eat on Shabbat should begin with two whole 
loaves of bread (&ldquo;lechem mishnah&rdquo;) . The third Shabbat meal cannot 
be eaten before the time for &ldquo;mincha gedolah&rdquo; which is 6.5 hours 
(&ldquo;sha&rsquo;ot zemaniyot&rdquo;) into the day. This poses the following 
problems when erev Pesach occurs on Shabbat:<br>
<br>
 (a) What does one use 
for &ldquo;lechem mishnah&rdquo; for the first two meals?<br>
<br>
 (b) How 
does one fulfill the mitzvah of eating the third Shabbat meal without bread, 
for it is forbidden to eat chametz after four hours (&ldquo;sha&rsquo;ot 
zemaniyot&rdquo;) into the day of erev Pesach?<br>
<br>
 2. One may use bread 
for &ldquo;lechem mishnah&rdquo; and general consumption on Friday night and 
Shabbat morning provided that the morning meal is eaten and finished before the 
end of the first four hours of the day (&ldquo;sha&rsquo;ot zemaniyot&rdquo;) . 
Therefore, one should rise early on such a Shabbat and pray with an early 
minyan. The service should be conducted with dignity, and conclude early enough 
to eat the second Shabbat meal before the time when the chametz is prohibited.
<br> <br>
 3. If one does not wish to use bread on Shabbat and has removed all 
chametz from the house before Shabbat, then he can use egg matzah 
(&ldquo;matzah ashira&rdquo;) for the first two Shabbat meals provided that the 
second meal is finished before the time when the chametz becomes prohibited. 
Although &ldquo;matzah ashirah&rdquo; is not chametz, it is our custom not to 
eat it during that time period when we may not eat chametz.<br>
<br>
 4. It is 
forbidden to eat regular matzah on erev Pesach. Therefore matzah cannot be 
eaten at the Shabbat meals. On Friday night, it is conceivable that one may use 
matzah since the prohibition against eating matzah is not probably dependent on 
daytime and not a 24-hour period. Yet, we are stricter and include Friday night 
in the prohibition.<br>
<br>
 5. There are several opinions as to what one may 
do for the third Shabbat meal.<br>
<br>
 a. Those whose custom it is to eat 
&ldquo;matzah ashirah&rdquo; on Pesach (contrary to the opinion of the Ramah 
&ndash; Rabbi Moshe Isserles) may use &ldquo;matzah ashirah&rdquo; for the 
&ldquo;lechem mishnah&rdquo; of the third meal provided that they conclude the 
meal before the end of 9 hours into the day (&ldquo;sha&rsquo;ot 
zamanyiot&rdquo;) .<br>
<br>
 b. One may use cooked matzahs for they are not 
included in the prohibition against eating matzah on erev Pesach. The 
prohibition encompasses only, baked matzah which can be used at the seder. Here 
too, one must finish the third meal before the end of 9 hours into the day 
(&ldquo;sha&rsquo;ot zamaniyot&rdquo;) .<br>
<br>
 c. Bread can be used for the 
third meal in the following manner: Immediately after the morning prayers, one 
washes, recites the &ldquo;beracha&rdquo; over &ldquo;lechem mishnah&rdquo; and 
eats the proper &ldquo;shi&rsquo;ur&rdquo; for &ldquo;birkat hamazon&rdquo;. He 
then recited the &ldquo;birkat hamazon&rdquo;. He has thus eaten the second 
Shabbat meal. After waiting a short while, he commences the whole procedure 
again, this time eating a whole meal. This is his third Shabbat meal. This 
third meal must be finished before the end of the fourth hours into the day. In 
this manner, one fulfills the mitzvah of the three Shabbat meals 
&ldquo;bedi&rsquo;avad&rdquo; since only some authorities allow the third meal 
to be eaten in this manner.<br>
<br>
 d. The third meal may consist of fruit or 
fish or meat to the exclusion of bread, for there are some authorities who 
state that these foods fulfill the requirement for the third meal. These foods 
can be eaten after the beginning of the 10th hour of the day provided that one 
partakes of then in moderation.<br>
<br>
 e. According to some opinion, one can 
learn Torah instead of eating the third meal. The Zohar states that 
particularly on this Shabbat, Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai would study Torah instead 
of eating the third Shabbat meal.<br>
<br>
 6. Our custom is to follow 
suggestions #c or #d. Therefore, one should either eat two meals before the end 
of the 4th hour (&ldquo;sha&rsquo;ot zemaniyot&rdquo;) or eat a third meal 
consisting of fruit, fish or meat.<br>
<br>
 Destruction And Voiding The Chametz
<br> 1. If one ate chametz on Shabbat by using bread from the house by the end 
of the fifth hour into the day (&ldquo;sha&rsquo;ot zemaniyot&rdquo;) .<br>
<br>
 2. Methods of removal are as follows:<br>
<br>
 a. Any tiny crumbs that remain 
may be deposited on the floor in a place where people regularly walk. It is 
preferable, however, to gather these crumbs and place them in the garbage can, 
toilet or outside the door of the house (provided there is no problem on 
&ldquo;hotza&rsquo;ah&rdquo; &ndash; removal from one domain to another) .<br>

<br> b. Larger pieces of bread can be given to a non-Jew. One should be careful 
not to ask the non-Jew directly to remove the chametz from the house. One may 
not give the non-Jew more than one meal&rsquo;s worth of chametz at a time.<br>

<br> c. The chametz may also be fed to a dog or flushed down the toilet. <br>

<br> d. If non of the above were done, then the chametz must be covered and 
placed in a safe, isolated spot in the house and burned after Yom Tov 
(&ldquo;motza&rsquo;ay yom tov&rdquo;) on Monday night.<br>
<br>
 3. Once one 
is prohibited to derive any pleasure whatsoever from chametz (the &ldquo;isur 
hana&rsquo;ah&rdquo; begins in the sixth hour), then the chametz is 
&ldquo;muktzah&rdquo; and a Jew can no longer move it from place to place. A 
non-Jew, however, may remove it for him.<br>
<br>
 4. One must void 
(&ldquo;bitul&rdquo;) the chametz at the proper time on Shabbat, erev Pesach, 
regardless of whether or not there actually is any chametz in the house. The 
&ldquo;bitul&rdquo; should be performed before the end of the fifth hour into 
the day (&ldquo;sha&rsquo;ot zamaniyot&rdquo;).<br>
<br>
 Washing The Dishes 
And Other Food Utensils<br>
 1. If chametz food is cooked for Shabbat, one 
should be careful not to prepare food which will stick to the pot and which 
would, therefore, have to be scrubbed on Shabbat. If one was not careful about 
this, then it is permissible to clean the pots but with minimal effort as 
possible.<br>
<br>
 2. Other pots and dishes should be cleaned gently and put 
away. Even if there is no chametz in them, they should be cleaned and put away.

<h1>What Is The Passover &ldquo;SEDER&rdquo;?</h1> 
<p>The Seder is a ritual banquet which reenacts the Exodus, conducted on both 
the first and second evenings of Passover.</p> 
<p>Its major feature is the reading of the Haggadah, which relates, in detail, 
the events of the Exodus of the Jewish people from ancient Egypt, complete with 
symbolic reenactments using Kosher wine, specially prepared Matzah, and bitter 
herbs.</p> 
<p>The specially prepared Shmurah Matzah is made specifically for use at the 
Seder, with specially supervised flour according to particularly stringent 
Jewish traditions and laws. The bitter herbs (Maror) consisting of either 
romaine lettuce or horseradish, commemorate the harsh conditions of slavery in 
ancient Egypt.</p> 
<p>Four cups of wine are consumed during the course of the Seder to 
commemorate the redemption of the Jewish people, the sanctity of the holiday 
and events related in the Haggadah. The Seder is a traditional occasion for 
Jewish families to gather together to reinforce their ties to Judaism.</p> Back 
to OU Passover Home Page Print Article 
<h1>What is &ldquo;Matzah&rdquo;?</h1> 
<p>Matzah is a crisp, flat, unleavened bread, made of flour and water, which 
must be baked before the dough has had time to rise. It is the only type of 
&ldquo;bread&rdquo; which Jews may eat during Passover, and it must be made 
specifically for Passover use, under rabbinical supervision.</p> 
<p>Eating Matzah on Passover commemorates the unleavened bread eaten by the 
Jews when they left Egypt in such haste that there was no time for the dough to 
rise. There are many mystical concepts tied to the unique relationship between 
Matzah and Chametz on Passover.</p> 
<p>One interpretation equates Matzah with G-d&rsquo;s commandments (Mitzvot), 
and Chametz with sin (Chayt). The rigorous laws of Passover, in this 
interpretation, represent the great care that must be taken to follow the G-dly 
path.</p> Back to OU Passover Home Page Print Article 
<h1>What is Kosher for Passover?</h1> 
<p>What Does &ldquo;KOSHER FOR PASSOVER&rdquo; Mean?</p> 
<p>During Passover, Jewish law forbids the consumption or possession by Jews 
of all edible fermented grain products (Chametz) or related foods. Therefore, 
even foods and household products which meet the strict, year-round dietary 
regulations, and are considered Kosher, are nevertheless, often unacceptable, 
or require special preparation for Passover use in the Jewish home in order to 
be Kosher for Passover.</p> 
<p>How Can One Tell If A Product is &ldquo;KOSHER FOR PASSOVER?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Most processed foods and beverages require special rabbinical supervision 
for Passover use. They must also be Kosher for year-round use, and prepared in 
accordance with all of the regular Jewish dietary laws.</p> 
<p>The 2000 Guide to Kosher for Passover Foods is available online.</p> 
<p>Jewish consumers are urged to look for the P or the Kosher for Passover 
designations as an integral part of the product label, and to be familiar with 
the rabbi or organization giving the Passover endorsement. The mere mention of 
Kosher For Passover on the label is not a sufficient guarantee of the 
product&rsquo;s acceptability for Passover use.</p> 
<p>The largest and most widely respected Kosher supervisory agency is the 
Kashruth Division of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America. Its 
registered service mark,OUP, on thousands of consumer and industrial food 
products, is a guarantee of the highest standards of Kashruth for Passover. 
Processed foods not carrying any rabbinical supervision should be cleared with 
a rabbi before Passover use, as should any medicines and vegetables.</p> Back

<h1>Preparing for Passover</h1> 
<p>What Special Preparations Must Be Made In The Jewish Home <br>
 For 
Passover?</p> 
<p>The home must be thoroughly cleaned of all Chametz before Passover. Any 
Chametz not removed from a Jew&rsquo;s premises before Passover should be sold. 
Jewish law forbids the use of any Chametz which remains in a Jew&rsquo;s 
possession during Passover, even after the holiday is over.</p> 
<p>All cooking and eating utensils must be either set aside exclusively for 
Passover use, or, in some cases, &ldquo;made Kosher&rdquo; in consultation with 
a rabbi, according to the procedures of Jewish law. All of these preparations 
must be completed by the morning before Passover.</p> 
<p>What Are The Rituals For The Period Before Passover Begins? </p> 
<p>The day before Passover is a fast day for Jewish firstborn males, in 
commemoration of the tenth plague, the slaying of the firstborn male Egyptians, 
which immediately resulted in the Exodus.</p> 
<p>In many congregations, a special celebration Siyum is conducted, following 
which participating firstborn males are permitted to break their fast. A ritual 
search for Chametz is conducted the previous night, and the Chametz that is 
found is burned the next morning.</p> 
<p>Preparing for Passover</p> 
<p>For more detailed instructions and guidance, a competent Halachic authority 
should be consulted.</p> 
<p>1. Removing Chametz</p> 
<p>A. Prior to Passover, every Jew is required to remove all Chametz from his 
home, property, and all premises under his or her jurisdiction (i.e. desk, 
office, locker, car). Even if one will not be on the premises during Passover, 
as long as one is there within 30 days of Passover, the obligation to remove 
all Chametz before Passover applies. In such cases, one should consult a 
competent Halachic authority and make the necessary arrangements.</p> 
<p>B. To facilitate the removal of Chametz, each Jew is obligated to conduct a 
diligent search in all places where Chametz may have been kept or consumed any 
time during the preceding year. The specified time for this search is the night 
before Passover, traditionally using a feather and the light of a single 
candle. However, Passover cleaning in Jewish homes must be started much 
earlier. The premises should be clean by the time the search begins 
(approximately 45 minutes after sunset). The blessing is recited before the 
search begins, and a public disclaimer of ownership of Chametz (Bitul) is 
recited afterward. These texts can be found in most traditional Haggadahs.</p> 
<p>C. It is permissible to sell Chametz to a non-Jew before the restrictions 
on Chametz go into effect on the day before Passover. To comply with the 
stringent requirements of Jewish law, the sale is conducted by contract through 
an Orthodox rabbi, who is empowered to act as an agent by a Power of Attorney 
Form for the Sale of Chametz. The sold Chametz is the non-Jew&rsquo;s property 
until after Passover ends and must be treated accordingly. The Chametz should 
be locked away until after Passover when the Rabbi repurchases it for the 
community.</p> 
<p>D. Restrictions on the eating, then use, and finally, possession of Chametz 
normally begin on the morning before Passover. Just before these restrictions 
begin, the remaining Chametz must be destroyed (usually burned) and a public 
disclaimer of Chametz ownership (Bitul) recited. The exact times depend on your 
geographic location. Consult your local Orthodox rabbi for the times when these 
restrictions go into effect, or see Halachic Times for Passover.</p> 
<p>E. Chametz which remains in a Jew&rsquo;s possession during Passover may 
not be used by him or any other Jew at any time, and it may not be purchased 
after Passover. If Chametz is discovered during Passover, it should be disposed 
of, in accordance with Jewish law, as soon as possible. Consult an Orthodox 
rabbi immediately for the appropriate procedures.</p> 
<p>2. Utensils For Use on Passover</p> 
<p>A. Jewish law requires special dishes, cooking utensils, glassware, and 
silverware for Passover use, with separate meat and dairy sets. They can be 
made of any material, including plastic or paper. Once these are used for 
Chametz, they may not be used again on Passover.</p> 
<p>B. If it is not possible to maintain a complete set of separate utensils 
for Passover it may be possible to use some year-round utensils for Passover 
after a special &ldquo;kashering&rdquo; procedure.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Kashering&rdquo; should only be done under the guidance of an 
Orthodox rabbi. Metal and wooden utensils, if they can be thoroughly cleaned, 
may be &ldquo;kashered,&rdquo; but earthenware utensils may not be 
&ldquo;kashered&rdquo;. Procedures for &ldquo;kashering&rdquo; depend on how 
the utensil was used during the year. Consult with your local Orthodox rabbi 
for details.</p> 
<p>C. Shelves, countertops and eating surfaces used year round should be 
cleaned and covered for Passover use, and special dish racks, sink racks and 
wash basins should be used. Cooking surfaces should be thoroughly cleaned and 
covered. Ovens should be thoroughly cleaned, and either &ldquo;kashered&rdquo; 
by being burnt out (consult your rabbi for details) or used with a special 
insert liner.</p> 
<p>3. Foods Which May Not Be Used On Passover</p> 
<p>A. Any food or food product containing fermented grain products (Chametz) 
may not be used or remain in a Jew&rsquo;s possession on Passover. Even foods 
with minute amounts of Chametz ingredients, or foods processed on utensils 
which are used for other Chametz-containing foods, are not permissible for 
Passover use.</p> 
<p>B. Ashkenazic Jews, (Jews of Eastern European descent) also do not eat many 
legumes (Kitniot) &ndash; beans, corn, peas, rice, etc. and products containing 
them as ingredients throughout Passover, while Sephardic, Yemenite and Oriental 
Jewish custom varies from one community to another.</p> 
<p>C. Because of the large number of food products which contain Chametz or 
Kitniot ingredients, only food products manufactured under reliable rabbinical 
supervision should be purchased for Passover use. That includes beverages, 
condiments, spices, and all processed foods such as fruits and vegetables, 
fish, meat and dairy products, and especially, baked goods.</p> 
<p>D. Grain alcohol is a fermentation product, and is therefore Chametz. Any 
edible items which normally contain grain alcohol, including whiskey, liquor, 
and liquid medications (however, see paragraph F for further information on 
medications), and even those which are not usually taken internally (such as 
perfumes, cologne, toilet water, hair spray, hair tonic, shaving lotion, 
mouthwash, liquid and roll-on deodorants) should be treated as Chametz unless 
specifically approved for Passover use.</p> 
<p>E. Totally inedible non-food products which contain grain alcohol such as 
polish, ink, paint and floor wax, are permissible for Passover use.</p> 
<p>F. Any person with a medical condition must consult his or her physician 
and rabbi to ascertain the medicines that should be taken during the holiday, 
and any special procedures that should be followed.</p> 
<p>G. There are many families which maintain the tradition of additional 
restrictions to their Passover diet. Some do not eat any food products made of 
Matzah or Matzah meal mixed with water (Gebrokts) during the first seven days 
of Passover.</p> Back to OU Passover Home Page Print Article 
<h1>What is Passover?</h1>

last, a fellow Jew!</p> 
<p>When he jovially asked him for a piece, the child fled indoors screaming, 
&ldquo;Mama, come quick! There&rsquo;s a damn Yankee Jew here!&rdquo; The

<h1>Glossary of Common Passover Terms</h1> 
<p>Chametz:</p> 
<p>Fermented or leavened wheat, rye, oats, spelt and barley. When these grains 
come in contact with water, they leaven within 18 minutes. In the case of hot 
or salted water, leavening takes place instantly. Chametz may not be consumed 
either by eating or drinking, and may not be held in one&rsquo;s possession, 
nor may any benefit be derived from chametz. Grain flour is commonly produced 
from grains that have been washed and tempered. Tempering is the process by 
which grains are softened by soaking in water, and this flour and all products 
made with it are, therefore, chametz.</p> 
<p>Kitniot<br>
 Leguminous vegetables such as beans, peas, corn and rice. The 
consumption of these foods is restricted by European Rabbinic tradition, though 
these foods are not chametz. Unlike chametz, benefit from and possession of 
kitniot during Passover are permitted. Yemenite, Sephardic and Oriental Jews 
are not bound to this custom by their traditions. The tradition of the kitniot 
restriction has been steadfastly maintained by all Jews of European origin for 
centuries. This includes the Jews of France, England, Germany, Russia, Poland, 
Hungary, Austria and the Low Countries.</p> 
<p>Matzah<br>
 Unleavened bread prepared from the flour of grains that have 
not been washed or tempered, and have been milled under supervision, completely 
protected from any contact with water. Matzah may be prepared only with water 
that has been stored overnight. It is kneaded into dough either by hand or 
machine, but only in a cool room, since heat may cause instant leavening. The 
dough may not be left idle for a period longer than 18 minutes.</p> 
<p>It is rolled into thin sheets and then baked. All equipment used in the 
preparation of matzah must be constantly cleaned of dough crumbs, and the oven 
in which matzah is baked must be set at the proper baking temperature. 
Insufficiently heated ovens cause leavening to occur. Once matzah has been 
baked properly, leavening can no longer occur, and the product can no longer 
become chametz. Therefore, matzah products such as ground matzah meal, flour 
and farfel may be cooked in hot water, baked or blended with any variety of 
Passover ingredients.</p> 
<p>Shmurah Matzah<br>
 Matzah used for the Seder on Passover eve. All Jews 
must fulfill the mitzvah of achilat matzah &ndash; eating of matzah. This 
matzah is eaten at the Seder just before the meal, at which time the blessings 
of Hamotzi and Al Achilat Matzah are pronounced. Such matzah must be prepared 
with the express purpose of the mitzvah of matzah, Le&rsquo;shem Matzot 
Mitzvah. It is traditional that the flour from which this matzah is prepared 
should be specially supervised from the time the wheat is cut &ndash; shmurah 
mishaat ketzirah. When this special supervision has been instituted only from 
the time of milling &ndash; techinah &ndash; matzot prepared from such flour 
may be used for matzot mitzvah only when the traditional shmurah mishaat 
ketzirah matzah is not available.</p> 
<p>Matzah Ashirah<br>
 Matzah made from flour kneaded with fruit juice or 
eggs. This matzah may not be used for the mitzvah regardless of which flour is 
used. This type of matzah is commonly referred to as egg or grape matzah. Water 
may not be used in the baking of this matzah since adding water to the dough 
would create instant leavening. According to Ashkenazic practice, such matzah 
may be consumed on Passover only by the elderly, sick or young children who 
cannot digest regular matzah. Sephardim should consult their Rabbi. Under 
normal circumstances, this matzah should not be used; both because it is feared 
that some water may have accidentally been blended into the dough, and in 
deference to the opinion which maintains that the mixture of flour with any 
liquid other than water causes immediate chametz.</p> 
<p>Bedikat Chametz<br>
 The search for chametz. On the night of the thirteenth 
of Nisan, Thursday, April 21, 2005, a search for chametz is to be conducted in 
the home, wherever chametz may have been brought during the year. The search is 
conducted in the evening, by candlelight. Chametz found during the search is 
set aside for burning the next day.</p> 
<p>Bitul Chametz<br>
 The nullification of chametz. Since chametz may not be 
held in one&rsquo;s possession during Passover, one may rid oneself of the 
chametz by declaring all types of chametz in one&rsquo;s possession to be dust 
and ashes, abandoned property. The bitul is pronounced immediately after the 
search, to nullify the chametz that may have been overlooked, and again after 
the burning in the morning, to include any additional chametz that may have 
come into one&rsquo;s possession in the interim.</p> 
<p>Biur Chametz<br>
 The destruction of chametz. All chametz in one&rsquo;s 
possession must be destroyed before Passover, by noon on the fourteenth of 
Nisan, Saturday, April 23, 2005. The daylight hours of each day are divided 
into twelve parts; each twelfth is then reckoned as a portion hour of that day. 
Chametz may be eaten until the end of the fourth portion hour (see the time 
listing for your area); it may be used or sold until the end of the fifth 
portion hour. During the sixth portion hour, all chametz must be destroyed. 
Since the fourteenth of Nisan occurs on Shabbat this year, special laws are in 
effect for biur chametz. Consult your local Orthodox Rabbi for guidance.</p> 
<p>Mechirat Chametz<br>
 Sale of chametz to a non-Jew. The requirement of biur 
chametz is limited to foods under Jewish ownership and possession. Chametz that 
has been transferred to a non-Jew need not be destroyed. Such transfer of 
chametz, by legal and binding sale with properly executed contract (shtar 
mechirah), gives the non-Jew full title to all chametz foods. This transfer is 
traditionally carried out by engaging the Rabbi to act as an agent, with power 
of attorney to sell the chametz to a non-Jew by means of kabalat kinyan and 
contract &ndash; shtar harshaah. The rabbi, acting as an agent for the owners 
of the chametz, then enters into an agreement with a non-Jew for the sale of 
chametz. When the sale is carried out, a limited amount of chametz is not sold 
and set aside to be destroyed on the following day, in order to fulfill the 
mitzvot of bedikah, biur and bitul. Chametz that has been sold must be put in a 
completely sealed-off place, inaccessible during Passover.</p> 
<p>Chametz She&rsquo;Avar Alav Ha&rsquo;Pesach<br>
 Any chametz held over 
Passover under Jewish ownership. This chametz may not be used or sold after 
Passover, as a penalty for failure to perform the mitzvot of bedikah and biur 
properly. Selling the chametz before Passover to a non-Jew avoids Jewish 
ownership during Passover. The mitzvot of bedikah and biur have therefore not 
been violated, and the injunction of chametz she&rsquo;avar alav 
ha&rsquo;Pesach is avoided.</p> Back to OU Passover Home Page Print Article 
<h1>A Brief Guide to the Passover Seder Plate</h1> 
<p>A special Seder plate is displayed during the Seder, containing the key 
elements of Passover. The plate is carefully prepared and placed before the 
head of the household, or the one conducting the Seder, who dispenses the Seder 
foods to each of the participants. The following items appear on the Seder 
plate:</p> 
<p>A. Three whole matzot &ndash; unleavened &lsquo;bread&rsquo; (either on the 
plate or next to it);</p> 
<p>B. Maror &ndash; bitter herbs, usually horseradish or romaine lettuce;</p> 
<p>C. Charoset &ndash; special mixture of apples, nuts, wine and cinnamon 
symbolizing mortar;</p> 
<p>D. Karpas &ndash; a vegetable, preferably parsley or celery;</p> 
<p>E. Zeroah &ndash; a piece of roasted or boiled meat or poultry, preferably 
a shankbone, recalling the Paschal sacrifice of the original Exodus. Before the 
destruction of the Jerusalem Temple the Paschal sacrifice was the central 
feature of the Seder;</p> 
<p>F. Baytzah &ndash; a roasted or boiled egg, commemorating the festival 
sacrifice that was brought at the Jerusalem Temple. An egg is used because it 
is a traditional food for mourners, reminding us of the destruction of the 
Temple in Jerusalem;</p> 
<p>G. There are other items that can be placed on Seder plates depending on 
the customs followed by the family.</p> 
<p>Basic Obligations<br>
 There are five basic obligations (mitzvot) performed 
by each Jew, in the course of the Seder conducted according to the traditional 
Haggadah:<br>
 1) Eating matzot<br>
 2) Drinking four cups of wine (Arbah Kosot)
<br> 3) Eating bitter herbs (maror)<br>
 4) Relating the story of the exodus 
(Haggadah or Magid)<br>
 5) Reciting Psalms of praise (Hallel)</p> 
<p>Matzah</p> 
<p>A. There are three times during the course of the Seder when matzah must be 
eaten &lsquo; at the beginning of the Seder meal, when the special blessing 
over matzah is made, for Korech (Hillel sandwich) together with the maror, and 
at the end of the meal for the afikoman.</p> 
<p>B. For the appropriate minimum quantities of matzah, and the time period in 
which it must be consumed, please refer to the following section on Shiurim.</p>
<p>C. Three unbroken matzot are required for the Seder plate for each Seder. 
Each individual must consume the minimum specified quantity of matzah during 
the course of the Seder. If the matzot from the Seder plate are insufficient, 
they should be supplemented by additional matzot.</p> 
<p>D. The matzah is eaten while reclining on the left side as a symbol of 
freedom. The piece of matzah called afikoman should be eaten before midnight, 
and no solid food should be eaten thereafter.</p> 
<p>E. To fulfill the mitzvot of the Seder, one must use shmurah matzot, which 
are produced under a special standard of supervision, beginning with the 
harvest of the grain (rather than with its milling into flour, as with regular 
matzot for Passover).</p> 
<p>F. According to Ashkenazic practice, matzah made with fruit juice or eggs, 
including egg matzah, chocolate covered egg matzah, and white grape matzah are 
permissible on Passover only for the elderly, sick, or young children who 
cannot digest regular matzah. Under no circumstances should they be eaten by 
others at any time during Passover, nor can they be eaten to fulfill the 
mitzvot of the Seder. Sephardim should consult their Rabbi.</p> 
<p>Four Cups of Wine<br>
 A. Each Jew is obligated to drink four cups of wine 
at these specific times during each Seder: the first at the start of the Seder, 
following kiddush; the second before the meal, after reciting the Haggadah 
story; the third following the grace after the meal; and the last after 
completing psalms of praise (Hallel).</p> 
<p>B. Please consult the following section on Shiurim for minimum volumes 
necessary to be consumed and time limits for each of the four cups.</p> 
<p>C. Red wine is the preferred beverage for use during the Seder. If a person 
has difficulty drinking wine, it may be diluted with kosher grape juice. If one 
wishes to dilute the wine with water, an Orthodox Rabbi should be consulted to 
determine the minimum acceptable proportions. If someone cannot drink even 
diluted wine, kosher grape juice may be substituted. If an individual cannot 
drink any grape product, then a Rabbi should be consulted on another substitute 
beverage in order to fulfill the mitzvah of drinking the four cups.</p> 
<p>D. One should drink the wine reclining on the left side, in order to 
symbolize freedom.</p> 
<p>Bitter Herbs (Maror)</p> 
<p>A. All persons are obligated to eat bitter herbs twice at each Seder. 
According to most authorities, the bitter herbs may consist either of romaine 
lettuce, horseradish or endives.</p> 
<p>B. When using romaine lettuce, one may use the stalks or leaves for maror. 
When horseradish is used for maror, it should be chopped, ground or grated to 
reduce its strength, but it must be covered so as not to be weakened too much. 
Cooked or preserved vegetables are not suitable for maror; therefore 
commercially prepared grated horseradish, which is packed in vinegar, may not 
be used for the mitzvah.</p> 
<p>C. The maror is dipped in charoset, a specially prepared mixture of wine, 
nuts, cinnamon, and apples, symbolizing the bricks and mortar of ancient Egypt.
</p> 
<p>D. Immediately thereafter, a second, smaller volume of maror is eaten with 
matzah in Korech (Hillel sandwich).</p> 
<p>E. When lettuce is used, it must be cleaned and inspected very carefully to 
remove the small insects which often are present in its leaves. One recommended 
way to clean lettuce of insects is to soak it for not more than half an hour in 
salt water, and rinse it in fresh water before inspection.</p> 
<p>F. Consult the following section on Shiurim for the minimum volume of maror 
to be consumed each time and the time limits.</p> 
<p>Relating the Story of the Exodus and Hallel</p> 
<p>A. Most of the unique Seder practices are designed to stimulate interest 
and arouse curiosity in the exodus story. The central theme for the Haggadah is 
the discussion of the exodus, a timeless event which has forged countless 
generations of Jews into an unbroken chain through history, with each 
year&rsquo;s Seder another link of that chain.<br>
 B. The Seder is a symbolic 
reenactment of the exodus, with a compelling message for young and old alike. 
Seder participants are encouraged to discuss the various aspects<br>
 of the 
exodus in detail, beyond the text of the Haggadah.<br>
 C. Young children are 
encouraged to participate in the<br>
 Seder to the extent of their ability. In 
addition to the Four Questions at the start of the Seder, they are encouraged 
to drink the Four Cups, eat the maror and matzah, and ask as many questions as 
they wish.<br>
 D. In addition to relating the story of the exodus, each Jew at 
the Seder is obligated to discuss three central elements of the Seder ritual 
&ndash; the Paschal sacrifice, the matzah<br>
 and the maror, as explained in 
the Haggadah. The Seder is a miniature recreation of the exodus, and 
participants should imagine themselves as leaving Egypt.<br>
 E. The formal 
part of the Seder closes with special psalms known as Hallel, which praise the 
Almighty and His<br>
 special relationship with the people of Israel.<br>
 F. 
The Seder traditionally concludes with the singing of<br>
 several lively songs 
celebrating the relationship between God and the Jewish people.</p> Back to OU

<h1>Passover FAQs</h1> 
<p>What is Passover?</p> 
<p>Passover is an eight day Jewish holiday, of biblical origin, marking the 
birth of the Jews as a people and their emergence as a unique nation in 
history, devoted to God&rsquo;s will. It celebrates the liberation of the 
children of Israel from slavery in Egypt over 3000 years ago, under the 
leadership of Moses.</p> 
<p>When Does Passover Begin?</p> 
<p>According to biblical law, Passover is determined by the Jewish lunar 
calendar, and begins on the eve of the fifteenth day of the month of Nisan. The 
English date varies from year to year, falling in March or in April. (This year 
Passover begins Saturday evening, April 23, 2005. Dietary restrictions begin 
approximately three hours before mid-day Saturday.)</p> 
<p>What Does KOSHER FOR PASSOVER Mean? </p> 
<p>During Passover, Jewish law forbids the consumption or possession by Jews 
of all edible fermented grain products (chametz) or related foods. Therefore, 
even foods and household products which meet the strict, year-round dietary 
regulations, and are considered kosher, are nevertheless, often unacceptable, 
or require special preparation for Passover use in the Jewish home in order to 
be kosher for Passover.</p> 
<p>How Can One Tell If a Product is KOSHER FOR PASSOVER? </p> 
<p>Most processed foods and beverages require special rabbinical supervision 
for Passover use. They must also be kosher for year-round use, and prepared in 
accordance with all of the regular Jewish dietary laws. Jewish consumers are 
urged to look for the &lsquo;P&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Kosher for Passover&rsquo; 
designations as an integral part of the product label, and to be familiar with 
the Rabbi or organization giving the Passover endorsement. The mere mention of 
Kosher for Passover on the label is not a sufficient guarantee of the 
product&rsquo;s acceptability for Passover use. The largest and most widely 
respected kosher supervisory agency is the Orthodox Union. Its registered 
service mark, &lsquo;P,&rsquo; on thousands of consumer and industrial food 
products, is a guarantee of the highest standards of kosher for Passover. 
Processed foods not carrying any rabbinical supervision should be cleared with 
a Rabbi before Passover use, as should any medicines and vegetables.</p> 
<p>What is &lsquo;Matzah&rsquo;? </p> 
<p>Matzah is a crisp, flat, unleavened bread, made of flour and water, which 
must be baked before the dough has had time to rise. It is the only type of 
&lsquo;bread&rsquo; which Jews may eat during Passover, and it must be made 
specifically for Passover use, under rabbinical supervision. Eating matzah on 
Passover commemorates the unleavened bread eaten by the Jews when they left 
Egypt in such haste that there was no time for the dough to rise. There are 
many mystical concepts tied to the unique relationship between matzah and 
chametz on Passover. One interpretation equates matzah with God&rsquo;s 
commandments (mitzvot), and chametz with sin (chayt).</p> 
<p>The rigorous laws of Passover, in this interpretation, represent the great 
care that must be taken to follow the Godly path.</p> 
<p>What Special Preparations Must Be Made In The Jewish Home For Passover?</p> 
<p>The home must be thoroughly cleaned of all chametz before Passover. Any 
chametz not removed from a Jew&rsquo;s premises before Passover should be sold. 
Jewish law forbids the use of any chametz which remains in a Jew&rsquo;s 
possession during Passover, even after the holiday is over. All cooking and 
eating utensils must be either set aside exclusively for Passover use, or, in 
some cases, &lsquo;made kosher&rsquo; in consultation with a rabbi, according 
to the procedures of Jewish law. All of these preparations must be completed by 
the morning before Passover. See the following section, &lsquo;Preparing the 
Home for Passover,&rsquo; for more specific details.</p> 
<p>What Are The Rituals For The Period Before Passover Begins? </p> 
<p>This year Thursday, April 21 is a fast day for Jewish firstborn males, in 
commemoration of the tenth plague, the slaying of the firstborn male Egyptians, 
which immediately resulted in the Exodus. In many congregations, a special 
celebration Siyum is conducted, following which participating firstborn males 
are permitted to break their fast. A ritual search for chametz is conducted 
Thursday evening, April 21, 2005 and the chametz that is found is burned the 
next morning.</p> 
<p>What Is The Passover SEDER? </p> 
<p>The Seder is a ritual banquet which reenacts the exodus, conducted on both 
the first and second evenings of Passover, (Saturday and Sunday, April 23 and 
April 24, 2005). Its major feature is the reading of the Haggadah, which 
relates, in detail, the events of the exodus of the Jewish people from ancient 
Egypt, complete with symbolic reenactments using kosher wine, specially 
prepared matzah, and bitter herbs.</p> 
<p>The specially prepared shmurah matzah is made specifically for use at the 
Seder, with specially supervised flour according to particularly stringent 
Jewish traditions and laws. The bitter herbs (maror) consisting of either 
romaine lettuce or horseradish, commemorate the harsh conditions of slavery in 
ancient Egypt. Four cups of wine are consumed during the course of the Seder to 
commemorate the redemption of the Jewish people, the sanctity of the holiday 
and events related in the Haggadah. The Seder is a traditional occasion for 
Jewish families to gather together to reinforce their ties to Judaism.</p> 
<p>When Do Passover Dietary Laws End? </p> 
<p>All Passover dietary laws remain in effect until nightfall of the eighth 
day of Passover, Sunday, May 1, 2005. Chametz which was in the possession or 
jurisdiction of a Jew during Passover, in violation of Jewish law, is forbidden 
for consumption by any Jew even after Passover.</p> 
<p>What Other Restrictions Are Applicable On Passover?</p> 
<p>Sabbath-like restrictions on work and creative activity, with the 
exceptions of carrying and the use of fire (with respect to cooking and the 
preparation of food), apply to all Jews on the first two and last two days of 
Passover. However, full Sabbath rules remain in effect on Friday evenings and 
Saturdays during Passover. With the exception of Sabbath, during the 
inter-mediate four days of Passover, Chol Hamoed (nightfall of Monday, April 
25, 2005 through shortly before sundown, Friday, April 29, 2005), and only 
nonessential work activities and crafts, as defined by Jewish law, are 
prohibited.</p> Back to OU Passover Home Page Print Article

<h1>A Special Concern for Wheat Derivatives</h1> 
<p>By: Rabbi Gavriel Price</p> 
<p>If one wants to begin to consider how a wheat (chometz) derivative could 
show up on a Schedule A without you even knowing it, one must understand the 
wondrous potential of an everyday substance:<br>
 the wheat starch molecule.</p>
<p>Wheat starch, like any other starch, is made up of nearly endless repeating 
units of glucose molecules, one next to another, connected by chemical bonds 
and forming relatively complex configurations. Glucose is a form of sweetener. 
But wheat starch, at least initially, does not taste sweet. Not until the 
glucose molecules are released from the bondage of the chemical bonds that bind 
the glucose to one another is the sweetness of glucose manifest. Glucose syrup 
is the result of widespread breakdown of a starch molecule to yield many 
individual glucose units. Wheat starch is a standard source of glucose, 
especially in Europe. There is nothing about glucose that would betray its 
source as being from wheat; and yet it is commonly made from that source, and 
therefore glucose, and dextrose, which is a synonym for glucose, requires 
vigilance with regards to Passover certification. Even corn-based glucose, 
which is commonly made in the United States, poses problems for Passover. And 
therefore any glucose must have specific authorization for use on Passover.</p> 
<p>Not only humans eat glucose; microorganisms like it too. Microorganisms are 
some of the most prolific manufacturers of ingredients in the food industry 
these days, participating actively in the production of all sorts of fermented 
ingredients, from xanthan gum to citric acid to riboflavin. These 
microorganisms, to do the work they have to do,must have carbohydrate sources, 
and often the source of choice is&hellip;glucose. The glucose source is 
essentially being converted by these critters to fermented ingredients. 
Therefore, these fermented<br>
 ingredients also merit scrutiny.</p> 
<p>Starch can be converted to glucose. But that&rsquo;s not the end of the 
line. Glucose can be fermented to ethanol. In fact, some of the ethanol 
that&rsquo;s being used to fuel cars in the U.S. comes from another form of<br>

 starch, cornstarch, which is produced in bundles in the Midwest. Wheat starch 
can also be used to produce alcohol. In fact, since so much corn is going to 
the fuel industry, a shortage of food grade alcohol has forced prices to rise, 
creating a scramble among food grade buyers of ethyl alcohol to look for 
sources other than corn-based. Sometimes alternative sources, such as 
byproducts of beer manufacture (a source of wheat alcohol), become tempting 
options.Add ethanol, otherwise known as ethyl alcohol, to the list of Passover 
sensitive<br>
 ingredients. Ethanol, to be approved for Passover,must be 
specifically certified.</p> 
<p>Starch to glucose, glucose to ethanol and ethanol to&hellip;acetic acid, 
aka vinegar. Vinegar makers buy ethanol to make distilled, white distilled, or 
white vinegar, which are various ways of saying the same thing. If the vinegar 
is wheat-derived, the vinegar is wheat derived. If the vinegar is corn-based, 
the vinegar is corn-based and, like glucose, means it can&rsquo;t be used under 
theOUP. If standard vinegar requires specific approval, that means that all the 
vinegar-based condiments, such as ketchup,mustard, mayonnaise, and dressing, 
require specific approval as well.</p> 
<p>These ingredients&mdash;starch, glucose (dextrose), ethanol, and acetic 
acid&mdash;touch on some of the primary derivatives of wheat, but do not 
comprehend the gamut of possibilities.</p> Back to OU Passover Home Page Print

<h1>Erev Pesach On Shabbat</h1> 
<p>By: Rabbi Alfred Cohen</p> 
<p>Probably the busiest and most hectic day of the year in every Jewish 
household is Erev Pesach, the day preceding Passover, for it entails getting 
rid of the last smidgen of chametz as well as preparing for the Seder. 
Moreover, it is a day during most of which one may not eat chametz, yet matzoh 
is likewish forbidden, straining the ingenuity of the food preparer.</p> 
<p>This year there will be an added complication, as this year erev Pesach 
occurs on the Sabbath, which has requirements and restrictions of its own. This 
paper will explore the problems which may arise from these dual requirements 
and advance various solutions.</p> 
<p>Before we begin, let us note the happy circumstance that the additional 
complication of observing the Sabbath on this so-busy day prior to Pesach 
brings with it some unexpected rewards: Having spent the day before Pesach 
resting, and refreshed by the Sabbath tranquility, all will be able to 
participate in the Seder at night with true appreciation1.</p> 
<p><b>Eating Chametz</b></p> 
<p>As noted, for most of Erev Pesach it is forbidden to eat bread (chametz), 
and yet matzoh is also not allowed. The Shulchan Aruch rules that &ldquo;it is 
forbidden to eat bread [on erev Pesach] from the tenth hour and on2. How then 
can we fulfill the Sabbath obligation to partake of three meals, each of which 
is accompanied by two loaves of &ldquo;bread3&ldquo;? Whether the 
&ldquo;bread&rdquo; be chametz or matzoh, when can it be eaten4?</p> 
<p>There are a number of ways to meet this requirement. We can suggest a few, 
all of which have variations and permutations, briefly summarized as follows: 
We can eat challah at all three meals; we can use egg matzoh for all the meals; 
we can use challah Friday night and early Shabbat morning, and egg matzoh for 
the third meal in the afternoon; or (if we don&rsquo;t want to use egg matzoh), 
we can use challah Friday night and early Shabbat morning, and skip the third 
meal. As we shall see, each of these solutions has its own problem, yet there 
are various reasons to recommend each one.</p> 
<p><b>Using Chametz</b></p> 
<p>One solution is to get up very early, daven, and then before the tenth 
hour, eat a meal at which two loaves of bread or challah are served5. Indeed, 
this is the counsel of the Shulchan Aruch:</p> 
<p>When erev Pesach occurs on Shabbat, we search the<br>
 house [for chametz] 
on the 13th [Thursday night] and<br>
 destroy all [chametz] before Shabbat, but 
we leave over<br>
 food for two meals which are required on Shabbat,<br>
 but 
the time for the third meal is after Mincha [and,<br>
 as we shall see, there 
is a halachic problem in eating<br>
 a meal after Mincha before the Seder6].</p>
<p>Although this scenario takes care of the problem of having a meal on 
Shabbat with two breads, it does introduce the problem of getting rid of 
chametz on Shabbat. The usual ways of disposing of chametz, by burning or by 
sale, cannot be employed on Shabbat. Large pieces of chametz which are 
difficult to destroy may be given to a non-Jew or else deposited in the garbage 
by a non-Jew. Cleaning the dishes and putting them away7 is also a problem. In 
a modern vein, Rav Sternbuch has suggested that it would be desirable to use 
paper or plastic dishes which could be discarded after the meal, thus obviating 
the need to get the regular dishes clean on Shabbat and put them away8.</p> 
<p>If for some reason, none of these options is feasible, the person should 
declare he is disowning any remaining chametz, cover it so that it is not 
visible, and burn it on Chol Hamoed9.</p> 
<p>It is a mitzvah to eat warm foods on Shabbat, but the Shulchan Aruch warns 
that one should be careful not to cook chametz foods which will stick to the 
pot, since it will not be possible to clean it properly before Pesach10. 
Further nuances at this unusual meal include serving cold food which 
won&rsquo;t stick, so that it will not be necessary to scrape out the plates or 
pot. Then, later in the day, one can fulfill the mitzvah of eating warm food by 
eating food cooked in Passover utensils, on dishes which will be utilized for 
the rest of the Passover holiday. According to the Mishnah Berurah, this is the 
way they used to do it in Europe11.</p> 
<p>Some of these practices are minor, but others involve severe biblical 
infractions. Rav Ovadia Yosef records that what to do on this Shabbat has long 
been a problem; an earlier rabbi of Alexandria, Egypt, had already bemoaned the 
mistakes arising out of ignorance, when<br>
 &hellip; Erev Pesach fell on the 
Sabbath, and how much<br>
 anguish I have in my heart at the prohibitions and
<br> errors that occurred on this Sabbath due to the eating<br>
 of chametz, 
because they were unable to be careful<br>
 properly concerning crumbs of 
chametz and cleaning<br>
 the house and the like, aside from the lack of Sabbath
<br> joy, inasmuch as they had to eat between the oven<br>
 and the stove; 
furthermore, many were late in reciting<br>
 the prayers on Shabbat, and it is 
possible that they ate<br>
 after the time when it is prohibited12.</p> 
<p>There are those who advise being scrupulous to rinse out the mouth very 
well, so that no chametz remains13.</p> 
<p>What about false teeth? Rav Ovadia Yosef sees little reason to do anything 
special with the teeth: since the food that one eats is not hot enough to be a 
problem halachically (otherwise he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to take it into his 
mouth) and since the teeth are not porous, little more than cleaning them well 
is required14. In an aside, he wryly mentions an individual who was unwilling 
to accept this lenient ruling and proceeded to deposit his false teeth in 
boiling water to &ldquo;kasher&rdquo; them &ndash; cracking them, and making it 
impossible for him to eat all Pesach15! However, Chok Leyisrael does take a 
stricter view of the matter16.</p> 
<p><b>Using Matzoh</b></p> 
<p>One way to avoid all the problems attendant upon using chametz at the meal 
is simply to use matzoh for lechem mishneh. But the Jerusalem Talmud denigrates 
a person who eats matzoh on the day before Pesach &ldquo;as if he had relations 
with his fiancee17 in his father-in-law&rsquo;s house18&rdquo;. Does that mean 
that it is forbidden to eat matzoh during the entire day? What is the law? 
Actually, there are three opinions as to when the prohibition of eating matzoh 
begins:</p> 
<p>(A) From Six Hours and On19. This time limit coincides with the time when 
eating chametz is forbidden on erev Pesach. In effect, whenever I may not eat 
chametz, I may also not eat matzoh. If we accept this understanding of the 
rule, it would be permitted to use matzoh at the Friday night meal and also for 
the meal (or meals) very early on the morning of the Sabbath, but not for a 
meal later in the day.</p> 
<p>(B) The Entire Day. This view holds that for the entire 24-hour period 
before Pesach, eating matzoh is precluded20. In this case, we could not use 
matzoh at any of the Sabbath meals before Pesach. The Magen Avraham considers 
this to be the proper view.</p> 
<p>&copy; During the Day Only. Although one could use matzoh on Friday night, 
it would not be permissible any time during the daylight hours21. Many accept 
this as the proper rule to follow.</p> 
<p>In point of fact, R. Moshe Feinstein forbids eating matzoh during the day 
of erev Pesach and discourages its use even for the Friday night meal preceding
22. However, he cautions that one should not reprimand someone who does employ 
the matzoh option on Friday evening. Furthermore, if there is cause for concern 
that by using chametz on Friday night and Shabbat morning it will raise serious 
difficulty in removing all the chametz properly before Pesach (in a hospital, 
for example), one may certainly use egg matzoh throughout the day of erev 
Pesach and recite all the usual blessings thereon.</p> 
<p>In addition to these strictly halachic criteria, there are also certain 
customs which are observed by many: some people stop eating matzoh from the 
beginning of the month of Nissan, while others stop after Purim23. However, no 
custom can ever be instituted which would have the effect of barring 
performance of a mitzvah. Therefore, if there were no other way for them to 
carry out the requirement to have three meals with lechem mishneh on this 
Shabbat, these persons, too, could use matzoh24.</p> 
<p><b>Which Matzoh Is Forbidden</b></p> 
<p>Considering the opposition of Chazal to eating matzoh before the proper 
time, it becomes essential to define precisely what qualifies as 
&ldquo;matzoh&rdquo; under the rubric of halacha. In the context of the 
rabbinic dictum, it is clear that only that product which is worthy to be eaten 
at the Seder is included in the category of matzoh which may not be eaten on 
the day preceding Pesach25. The only matzoh which can be used at the Seder to 
fulfill the mitzvah of matzoh is &ldquo;a poor man&rsquo;s bread&rdquo; &ndash; 
flat bread which is made from a mixture of flour and water only. If juice or 
eggs are added to or substituted for the water in the mix, it is called 
&ldquo;matzoh ashira26&ldquo;(egg matzoh), and is not suitable for the Seder. 
Similarly, plain matzoh which has subsequently been cooked or fried does not 
qualify for the mitzvah of &ldquo;matzoh&rdquo; at the Seder27. Thus, all 
these, which are technically not &ldquo;matzoh&rdquo; according to the halacha, 
are exempt from the stricture against eating matzoh on erev Pesnch. 
Accordingly, egg matzoh could be used for Lechem Mishneh, the two breads at the 
Sabbath meals.</p> 
<p>There is a halachic difficulty attendant upon using egg matzohs as the two 
loaves of bread required for the meals on Shabbat: According to many rabbis, 
egg matzoh cannot technically be classified as &ldquo;bread&rdquo; requiring 
washing the hands, reciting the blessing hamotzi, and followed by birkat 
hamazon, since unlike real matzoh, it is made with eggs and/or juice instead of 
just plain water with the flour. Nevertheless, even if egg matzoh is not 
&ldquo;bread&rdquo; within the definition of the term, it can still take the 
place of bread at a meal, provided that it is used instead of bread and that a 
sufficient amount is &lsquo;consumed28&lsquo;. This is the rule any time cake, 
crackers, or any baked goods are eaten in sufficient quantity to qualify as a 
meal.</p> 
<p>How much egg matzoh is required so that it can substitute for real bread? 
Here, there is a difference of opinion among the poskim: ( a) Some say that 
&ldquo;one who eats a volume of cake equal to four (or three) eggs &hellip; 
must treat the cake as bread.&rdquo; (b) There are those who &ldquo;conclude 
that the amount of one meal equals somewhat more than the volume of twenty-one 
eggs,&rdquo; and only someone who eats this equivalent of cake should recite 
hamotzi. &copy; Most poskim, however, reject both these opinions, one as being 
too meager, the other as being far too large. In their opinion, cake or egg 
matzoh &ldquo;is measured in terms of the quantity that is generally eaten 
during the course of a full meal29.&rdquo; This is the opinion of Rav Moshe 
Feinstein30 and most other poskim. </p> 
<p>According to some authorities, another type of matzoh which might be 
considered permitted for use on Erev Pesach is matzoh which is not matzoh shmura
31. The reasoning here is that since at the Seder we must use matzoh shmura, 
any other type of matzoh is disqualified and consequently could not have been 
intended by the rabbis castigating those who eat matzoh on erev Pesach.</p> 
<p>In summation, Rav Ovadia Yosef, whose decisions are generally accepted by 
Sephardic Jews, rules that:<br>
 &hellip; it is proper to destroy the chametz 
before Shabbat &hellip; and to use for Shabbat only utensils that are fit for 
Pesach &hellip; and on Shabbat to use only food and utensils reserved for 
Pesach, and one should fulfill the precept of meals for Shabbat with matzoh 
which is cooked in chicken or meat soup, in the following manner: after the 
food is wholly cooked, let him remove it from the fire,and while the food in 
the pot is still extremely hot, let him put into the pot several pieces of 
matzoh, as much as he needs, in such a way that the matzoh thoroughly soaks up 
the flavor of the food, and then he can use this to fulfill the mitzvah of 
three meals32.</p> 
<p>He prefers the use of re-cooked or fried matzoh to egg matzoh, since the 
halacha is not clear as to how much egg matzoh must be eaten for the blessing 
hamotzi and for Grace after Meals33.</p> 
<p>However, if one decides to adopt the option of using egg matzoh as the 
&ldquo;bread at the three meals on that Shabbat, which is an option permitted 
or even suggested by some34, it is evident that this would solve the problem 
for all three meals; furthermore, it would not be necessary to get up early to 
daven so as to eat chametz before the time when it is no longer permitted.</p> 
<p><b>Seudah Shelishit</b></p> 
<p>Till now, we have discussed the ways in which it is possible to meet the 
requirement to eat the first two meals on Shabbat &ndash; the one on Friday 
night and the one on Shabbat morning. As for the third meal, that has its own 
unique questions.</p> 
<p>Mishnah Berurah raises the option of dividing the early morning meal 
(before the tenth hour) into two, by making a blessing on two challahs of 
bread, eating, reciting Grace, then washing again, eating from another two 
challahs, and reciting Grace again35. This solution, although ingenious, may 
not be halachically feasible. First of all, the third meal of Shabbat should 
really be eaten after Mincha. Secondly, it is questionable whether it is 
permitted to break up what is essentially one meal by reciting birkat hamazon 
and then immediately washing and making another blessing on bread. This may be 
a case of beracha she-aina tzericha, reciting blessings for no reason, which is 
quite a serious matter. There would have to be an interval between the end of 
one meal and the beginning of the next. Considering that we are very pressed 
for time so early on the morning of erev Pesach, leaving a sufficient interval 
between these two early meals may be problematic. Thirdly, it may be possible 
to dispense with bread altogether and fulfill the requirements of the third 
meal by eating something else:<br>
 [The third meal] has to be eaten with 
&ldquo;bread&rdquo;, but there are those who say that one can make the meal 
with those things which accompany bread, such as meat or fish, but not with 
fruit. And there are those who say that one can make [the meal] out of fruit. 
But the first opinion is the major one, i.e., that one should make a meal with 
bread unless he is too full, or in a situation where it is impossible for him 
to eat bread, such as on erev Pesach which comes out on Shabbat, when it is 
forbidden for him to eat bread after Mincha36.</p> 
<p>The Mishnah Berurah, Orach Chaim37, maintains that it is preferable to eat 
one meal that really satisfies the hunger, and is a true meal, rather than 
breaking up the meal into two. However, other authorities, including the Vilna 
Gaon, advise that the early morning meal should be interrupted and followed by 
another meal38.</p> 
<p>It is the decision of the Shulchan Aruch that for the third meal, one 
should use egg matzohs for the two loaves. But the Ramo does not permit this 
choice for Ashkenazi Jews, opting instead for a meal without bread of any type:
<br> In our [Ashkenazi] countries, where it is our custom not to eat matzoh 
ashira &hellip; one should fulfill [the obligation to have] a third meal with 
various types of fruit or with meat and fish39.</p> 
<p>This ruling by the Ramo is the source of considerable discussion among the 
rabbis. Here he categorically rejects the option of using egg matzoh, yet, when 
the Shulchan Aruch, as quoted above, suggests that on erev Pesach which falls 
on Shabbat, it might be a good idea to use egg matzoh &ndash; the Ramo makes no 
demurrer40! In the face of conflicting directives by this major posek, many 
authorities conclude that the Ramo means to be strict about egg matzoh only for 
Pesach itself, and not on erev Pesach41!</p> 
<p>It is a custom to recite the Torah portion dealing with the Paschal 
sacrifice at the conclusion of this third meal42.</p> 
<p><b>Handling the Matzoh</b></p> 
<p>If a person decides to use regular challah for the meal, but is afraid that 
he will be unable to consume the entire two loaves (and have difficulty 
disposing of them on Shabbat), he might want to employ the option of 
substituting a well-wrapped matzoh instead of the second loaf of challah. 
Indeed, this is the advice given by the Chazon Ish43. This would seem to 
present a good solution &ndash; except that we possibly run into the problem of 
muktza.</p> 
<p>Muktza may not be moved on Shabbat. Generally, something is considered 
muktza if it cannot or will not be used on Shabbat (for example, a 
carpenter&rsquo;s hammer, a telephone). Can we use matzoh for the second bread 
at the meal on Shabbat, when on this Shabbat we are certainly not allowed ta 
eat matzoh? The rabbis make an interesting distinction in this regard: matzoh 
shmura, which is what people will be eating at night at the Seder, is certainly 
muktza on the Shabbat of ereu Pesach. However, regular matzoh can be given to a 
young child to eat even today, and therefore it is not muktza; it can be moved, 
it can be placed on the table and subsequently removed44.</p> 
<p><b>Setting the Table For the Seder</b></p> 
<p>On a Sabbath or Festival, it is not permitted to make any preparation for 
after the Sabbath, even if it will be a Festival at night. Therefore, one 
should not set the table for the Seder nor make any other preparations until 
the conclusion of Shabbat. However, the Shulchan Aruch45 makes an exception on 
Shemini Atzeret, which is the last day people eat in the succah. The next day 
is Simchat Torah, and the Shulchan Aruch permits removal of utensils from the 
succah on Shemini Atzeret, to be brought into the house. The Ramo cautions that 
although the utensils may be brought in from the succah, the table should not 
be set in the house until after nightfall.</p> 
<p>Why does the halacha permit removing objects from the succah, when it 
appears that it is in preparation for using them in the house on the next day? 
According to the Chayei Adam46, this is only a concession because it would be 
very difficult to clean up the succah at night, in the dark. Furthermore, if 
one has not completed the preparations, it is not considered preparing.</p> 
<p>Apparently, it is permitted to do anything which will be very difficult to 
undertake later on (for example, the wine is in the cellar, which is very 
dark). Not only that: but if bringing in the utensils from the succah or the 
wine from the cellar will make the house look sloppy, it would even be 
permissible to put them away in their proper place. This is not done in 
preparation for the next day but in honor of the Sabbath itself47.</p> 
<p>Although there are some lenient opinions, most rabbis do not permit one to 
change into clothing for the Seder on Shabbat. But having a non-Jew set the 
table for the Seder is permitted48.</p> 
<p><b>The Seder Plate</b></p> 
<p>In the special situation when erev Pesach occurs on Shabbat, all 
preparations for the Seder should be completed on Friday. Since Ashkenazim do 
not actually eat the egg and the shankbone on Pesach (since they are roasted), 
they should also be prepared before Shabbat, not on the holiday. However, if 
one forgot, they should be roasted on Saturday night and eaten during the day 
on Sunday. And if one forgot to make the charoset, it may be done on Saturday 
night, albeit with a shinui (modification of technique49). Somewhat different 
is the case of marror, for we do not want it to lose its bitter taste; 
therefore, we make it on Saturday night, with a shinui?&rsquo; or else make it 
on Friday and store it in a sealed container50.</p> 
<p><b>Bedikat chametz</b></p> 
<p>When erev Pesach falls on Shabbat, we search the house for chametz on 
Thursday evening, since we are not able to go around with a candle on Friday 
night. What if one forgot to do it on Thursday? It has been suggested that one 
should do it on Friday night, having a non-Jew carry the candle51. But others 
object, claiming that the person will be so concerned lest a fire begin, he 
will not have his mind on searching for chametz properly. Therefore, Rav Braun 
rules that he should just not do the search; undoubtedly, the house has been 
thoroughly cleaned and checked already52.</p> 
<p><b>Fast of The Firstborn</b></p> 
<p>In remembrance of their miraculous salvation when all the firstborn of 
Egypt were smitten, it is the practice for the firstborn to fast on erev Pesach 
. What is to be done this year, since they cannot fast on Shabbat? Terumat 
Hadeshen53 and Maharil54 rule that the fast should be observed on the previous 
Thursday, but others55 maintain that since the fast is only a custom, and the 
custom cannot be observed on the proper day &ndash; it should not be done at 
all. In citing this law, the Shulchan Aruch records both opinions:<br>
 If erev 
Pesach occurs on Shabbat, there are those who say that the firstborn should 
fast on Thursday, and there are those say that they do not fast at all56.</p> 
<p>It is interesting to note that, in a departure from the established 
practice of Sephardic Jews to follow the second option when two are listed, in 
this case Rav Ovadia Yosef rules that the firstborn should fast on Thursday57. 
For Ashkenazim, Rav Moshe Feinstein has issued the same ruling based on the Ramo
58.</p> 
<p><b>Working on Friday</b></p> 
<p>In general, it is forbidden to go to work after midday on any erev Pesach59
. Two reasons are given for this stricture: (1) to prepare for the Festival and 
(2) this is the time when the paschal sacrifice was brought, which makes it a 
holy time, when work is forbidden60. If we accept the first reason as the true 
rationale, then going to work should be forbidden on Friday afternoon in our 
case, since that is the time one should prepare for Pesach. However, if the 
second reason is really the central one, there would be no reason to desist 
from work on Friday &ndash; the paschal lamb was sacrificed on erev Pesach even 
when it was a Sabbath. Thus, no special restrictions attend Friday afternoon. 
Following this second line of thought, Rav Yosef permits work on Friday 
afternoon61.</p> 
<p>There is one mitzvah of erev Pesach which we have not discussed in this 
paper &ndash; how the Passover lamb was sacrificed if it occurred on a Shabbat. 
Unfortunately, this is one mitzvah of Pesach which we do not yet have the 
zichirat of experiencing. May the Redeemer come speedily and bring us all back 
to our glorious Temple, where we will be able to fulfill this as well as all 
the other mitzvot of Pesach, the Festival of our Redemption.</p> 
<p>1 Chok Leyisrael p. 71, cites a custom to eat dairy foods on this Shabbat 
so as to induce drowsiness; sleep will enhance one&rsquo;s ability to enjoy the 
Seder at night. However, Sefer Chassidim 266, cited in Be&rsquo;er Hetev 290, 
warns that one should not specifically state that he is sleeping on Shabbat so 
that he can be rested for the Seder after Shabbat. See also Radvaz 780.</p> 
<p>2 Orach Chaim 471:1. For the halachic definition of &ldquo;hour&rdquo;, see 
Mishnah Berurah, Orach Chaim 443:7,8.</p> 
<p>3 It is interesting to note that Mishnalt Berurah, Orach Chaim 470:11, 
totally dismisses the obvious option of forgoing having &ldquo;bread&rdquo; at 
these meals altogether, since having any type of bread raises so many problems. 
Even if one would argue that by skipping having substantial meals this Shabbat, 
the person will be able to appreciate eating all the more at the Seder, it 
cannot<br>
 be countenanced. See also Yechave Daat VI:27.</p> 
<p>4 There are additional questions which arise on ereu Pesach which is 
Shabbat, such as which Haftorah to read and when to gather for the derasha of 
Shabbat Hagadol. However, these and similar questions are of a communal nature, 
and we will not discuss them here.</p> 
<p>5 Together with the meal eaten Friday night, this will take care of two 
Sabbath meals. What to do about the third meal will be discussed later in the 
text. Chok Leyisrael, p.70, advises what a person should do if he forgot to 
leave over bread for this last meal. May he use matzoh instead?</p> 
<p>In order to keep the chametz confined to as small an area as possible, some 
people may decide to eat the bread in one room, and then adjourn to the dining 
room to eat the rest of the meal, using Passover dishes. Where should birkat 
hamazon be recited? Where they washed and ate bread, or where they ate the 
majority of the meal? See solutions offered by Erev, Pesach Shechal BeShabbat, 
p. 62.</p> 
<p>There may also be a need to make new berachot when continuing the meal in 
this fashion in another room. See Orach Chaim,, 177:2.</p> 
<p>It is also questionable whether one can make kiddush or eat part of the 
meal in a room where the Sabbath candles are not lit. This is a situation which 
arises not only on this particular Sabbath but also when a family goes to a 
hotel for Shabbat, where usually all the women light candles in a separate 
place, not in the dining room. For a full discussion of the halacha, see Ibid, 
p. 104.</p> 
<p>6 Orach Chaim 444:1</p> 
<p>7 Preferably by a non-Jew or with a shinui (an &ldquo;unusual&rdquo; way of 
doing an action), Mishnah Berurah, Orach Chaim 444:15. Shearim Metzuyanim 
Behalacha, kuntres acharon 1152 discusses what to do with the candlesticks 
which may be on the tablecloth. In Ereu Pesach Shechal BeShabbat, which is 
probably the most exhaustive study of these laws, Rabbi Zev Cohen suggests that 
a child could remove the chametz (p.130), and offers suggestions for removal of 
the candlesticks if it is necessary to change the tablecloth (p.99). The 
question is also discussed in Sedei Chemed 7, pp. 160 and 429.</p> 
<p>8 See Mishnah Berurah, Orach Chaim 444:18.</p> 
<p>9 The Chayei Adam permits one to sell it to a non-Jew on Shabbat, but Pri 
Megadim and Graz do not. See Shearim Metzuyanim Behalacha 115:4 for further 
opinions on this.</p> 
<p>10 Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 444:3. Whether it is permissible to give the 
remainder to animals is discussed by Moadim Uzemanim, 7:160.</p> 
<p>11 Orach Chaim, no. 14. See also Ereu Pesach Shechal BeShabbat, p. 65.</p> 
<p>12 Yechaue Daat 91, n.11, based on Responsa Taalumot Leu I , 4. Rav Yosef 
wonders why the rabbis concerned themselves with the disposal of crumbs, 
inasmuch as the Gemara rules that &ldquo;crumbs are negligible and 
&lsquo;nullify&rsquo; themselves.&rdquo; The Mishnah Berurah, Orach Chaim 44415 
does too. Eliahu Rabbah 444 states that singing z&rsquo;mirot should be skipped 
this Shabbat, in order to avoid possible delay in completing the meal on time.

individual to whom it was revealed in a dream that he was eating chametz on

false teeth; if one pours boiling water over them on Shabbat, ostensibly to 
clean them but really with the intention of rendering them usable for Pesach, 
is this a permissible haarama or not?</p>

Chatam Sofer on Pesach, he rules in 444 that it is better to forego lechem

respect to re-cooked matzoh. One could argue that once the dough was baken into 
matzoh, it became forbidden for consumption on erev Pesnch and the subsequent 
cooking cannot remove the issur.. Responsa Hnelef Lecha Shlonm 322 also 
considers that matzoh cooked after baking may still not be consumed on erev 
Pesach.</p>

already removed all chametz before Shabbat to serve this type of matzoh on 
Shabbat erev Pesach. But he does suggest that it would be better to use matzoh 
fried or cooked in oil rather than plain.</p> 
<p>32 Yechave Daat p.279. In footnote 11 he explains why refraining from 
eating chametz on erev Pesach is not considered &ldquo;adding a mitzvah (bal 
tosin. However, in Nezer Hakodesh 110.52, Rabbi Rosen does count not eating 
matzoh on the day before Pesach as<br>
 bal tosif. Although he disagrees with 
the reasoning, Rav Ellenberg, does agree with the conclusion of Rav Rosen 
(Shlomei Simchai 18 and part 5, 36-7), that one should not use matzoh for the 
meal on erev Pesach. Moadim Uzemanim, Haggada p.5, concurs.</p>

141:21 and Aruch Hashlrlchan 444:5 discuss the egg matzoh option for 
Ashkenazim, who generally refrain from using egg matzoh altogether on Pesach. 
However on erev Pesach, they feel it may be used. However, Shod Umeishiv,l75, 
does not allow<br>
 eating egg matzoh on era Pesaclz. See Shearim Metzzryanim 
Behalacha 115:5, who tries to explain how two rabbis from the same city could

<p>38 Shearim Metzuyanim Behalacha, kuntres acharon 115:7; Nimukei Yosef, end

this day, and whether this is included in the ban on eating matzoh on erev

<p>41 Erev Pesach Shechal BeShabbat, p.111. Rav Moshe Feinstein Orach Chaim

different from teuel, which is rabbinically forbidden, which cannot be given to 
a child. Also, in his Haggada, p. 95:6, he points out that since technically 
matzoh may be eaten on Friday night, at the beginning of the Sabbath, it 
doesn&rsquo;t become muktza thereafter (ein muktza lechatzi Shabbat). See 
furthermore the Kaf Hachaim 471:24. Erev Pesach Shechal BeShabbat p. 107, n. 3,

48:16, reports that the Chatam Sofer used to bake matzoh for the Seder on 
Saturday night, because that was the tradition he received from his teachers. 
This tradition is difficult to understand: the reason for the custom of baking 
matzoh in the afternoon of erev Pesach to be used that night at the Seder is 
that that was the time of offering the paschal lamb. How can baking them on 
Saturday night serve that purpose? Surely the sacrifice was not brought then!

Article 
<h1>What is Kitniyot?</h1> 
<p>In addition to the Torah&rsquo;s restrictions on owning, eating and 
benefiting from chametz, an Ashkenazic minhag developed in the middle ages to 
not eat certain foods known collectively as &ldquo;kitnios&rdquo;. The Mishnah 
Berurah (453:6 &amp; 464:5) cites three reasons for the minhag (a) kitnios is 
harvested and processed in the same manner as chametz, (b) it is ground into 
flour and baked just like chametz [so people may mistakenly believe that if 
they can eat kitnios, they can also eat chametz], ( c ) it may have chametz 
grains mixed into it [so people who eat kitnios may inadvertently be eating 
chametz]. Although initially there were those who objected to the minhag, it 
has become an accepted part of Pesach in all Ashkenazic communities.</p> 
<p><b>Which foods are kitnios</b></p> 
<p>The earlier Poskim mention that rice, buckwheat/kasha, millet, beans, 
lentils, peas, sesame seeds and mustard are included in the minhag (see Beis 
Yosef O.C. 453, Rema 453:1 &amp; 464:1 and Mishnah Berurah 453:4, 7 &amp; 11) 
and it is generally accepted that corn (see below), green beans, snow peas, 
sugar-snap peas, chickpeas, soybeans, sunflower and poppy seeds are also 
forbidden. On the other hand, potatoes (see below), coffee, tea, garlic, nuts, 
radishes and olives and not treated as kitnios (see Sha&rsquo;arei Teshuvah 
453:1, Chayei Adam 127:7 and others). Iggeros Moshe (O.C.III:63) assumes that 
peanuts are not kitnios but notes that some have a custom to be machmir. Some 
other examples of foods which are or aren&rsquo;t kitnios will be noted below 
and in the &ldquo;Derivatives of kitnios&rdquo; section.</p> 
<p>Iggeros Moshe explains that the minhag to not eat kitnios developed 
differently than other minhagim and therefore rules that only foods which we 
know were specifically included in the minhag are forbidden. [See also Chok 
Yaakov 453:9 who makes a similar point]. With this he explains the generally 
accepted custom to not consider potatoes to be kitnios even though logically 
they should be, as follows: the minhag of kitnios can be dated back at least 
until Maharil, who died in 1427, and potatoes didn&rsquo;t come to Europe until 
the 16th century, so potatoes were a &ldquo;new&rdquo; vegetable which 
wasn&rsquo;t included in the minhag. This logic has also been suggested as a 
basis for permitting the consumption on Pesach of a grain called quinoa. The 
thinking is that since quinoa, which has only recently been introduced to the 
Northern Hemisphere from its native South America, was never considered 
kitnios, it remains permitted on Pesach even though logically it should be 
included in the minhag. While this logic is sound, it is noteworthy that quinoa 
is often packaged in plants that also package wheat and barley, and it is 
possible that those grains (i.e. chametz) could get mixed into the quinoa. 
Therefore, before using quinoa on Pesach, someone who knows how to distinguish 
between these grains should check the quinoa to ascertain that it doesn&rsquo;t 
contain any wheat or barley. An important &ldquo;exception&rdquo; to the 
aforementioned rule that &ldquo;new&rdquo; vegetables aren&rsquo;t included in 
the minhag, is corn/maize which Mishnah Berurah 453:4 and others rule is 
kitnios even though it was introduced to Europe after the minhag had already 
begun.</p> 
<p>As a rule, spices are not considered to be kitnios and Rema 453:1 makes a 
point of noting that anise/dill and coriander are not kitnios. Taz 462:3 notes 
that all spices should be checked before Pesach to establish that no 
chametz-grains are mixed in, and elsewhere Taz (453:1) specifically notes that 
anise and coriander seeds should be thoroughly checked. In addition, Taz and 
Magen Avraham (453:3) discuss whether fennel, cumin and caraway seeds (i.e. 
three variations of &ldquo;Kimmel&rdquo; ) can possibly be checked (and used) 
for Pesach. Thus, as a rule, spices are not kitnios but require special care to 
guarantee that no chametz-grains are mixed into them. Some hashgochos consider 
fenugreek to be kitnios while others do not, and the surprising ramifications 
of this question will be noted towards the end of the article.</p> 
<p><b>Derivatives of kitnios</b></p> 
<p>The earlier Poskim, including Rema, clearly indicate that oil made from 
kitnios is forbidden on Pesach, but some of the later Poskim suggest that such 
oil may be permitted because some of the original reasons for the minhag 
don&rsquo;t apply to the oil extracted from kitnios. It is generally accepted 
to follow the stricter opinion in this matter, but the lenient opinion is 
sometimes considered as one factor in a larger decision.</p> 
<p>Therefore, on Pesach one may not use corn or soybean oil (a.k.a. 
&ldquo;vegetable oil&rdquo; ), and some do not use peanut oil either (see above 
regarding peanuts). Oil from olives, palm, coconut and walnuts are acceptable 
for Pesach use because the fruits they are extracted from is not kitnios. 
Minchas Yitzchok (III:138:2) suggests that cottonseed oil is kitnios, but in a 
subsequent teshuvah (IV:114:3) he reconsiders this position (see also 
Mikra&rsquo;ai Kodesh, Pesach II:60:2); in the United States cottonseed oil is 
generally not considered to be kitnios but in Eretz Yisroel there are those who 
refrain from using it.</p> 
<p>Canola oil was first approved for food use in the United States in 1985 and 
there are those who therefore suggested that it is a &ldquo;new&rdquo; item 
which shouldn&rsquo;t be included in the minhag, as per Iggeros Moshe cited 
above. However, the fault with this line of reasoning is that &ldquo;Canola 
oil&rdquo; is actually &ldquo;Rapeseed oil&rdquo; (a.k.a. colza oil) which has 
been used for centuries in Europe. [&ldquo;Canola oil&rdquo; is rapeseed oil 
specially bred to have less erucic acid (a suspected cause of heart disease) 
and therefore only this better variation of rapeseed oil is approved for food 
use in theUSA]. In fact, Avnei Nezer (373 &amp; 533) and Maharsham (I:183) 
specifically mention rapeseed and its oil in their discussions of kitnios. It 
is also noteworthy that canola often grows near oats, and therefore even those 
who might argue that canola isn&rsquo;t kitnios would agree that all of the 
oats must be removed before the oil is extracted from the canola.</p> 
<p>In recent decades, scientists have learnt to manipulate microorganisms to 
create and convert all types of enzymes and foods. This has had dramatic 
effects on the world of kashrus, including kitnios. What happens if one takes 
bland-tasting corn, and uses enzymes to liquefy and sweeten it &ndash; does the 
resulting corn syrup remain forbidden as kitnios? Is the halacha possibly more 
lenient if one takes the aforementioned corn syrup and uses enzymes to convert 
it to sour-tasting ascorbic acid?</p> 
<p>These questions depend on a machlokes Rishonim cited in Mishnah Berurah 
216:7 regarding the kashrus of musk &ndash; a fragrant byproduct of blood which 
is found in the abdominal gland of the male musk deer. Some Rishonim hold that 
since blood is non-kosher, musk is also forbidden, but others holds that once 
the blood is nishtaneh &ndash; changed &ndash; it loses its original identity 
and becomes an innocuous kosher liquid. Mishnah Berurah rules that as relates 
to issurim d&rsquo;rabannan one may be lenient.</p> 
<p>Accordingly, some hashgochos hold that since kitnios is merely a minhag 
(i.e. even less than an issur d&rsquo;rabannan) one can be lenient and certify 
kitnios which was truly nishtaneh. In order to qualify as 
&ldquo;nishtaneh&rdquo; the kitnios must go through a significant change in 
taste; therefore in the cases noted above, they would certify the ascorbic acid 
due to the dramatic change in taste from sweet to sour but wouldn&rsquo;t 
permit the corn syrup since it isn&rsquo;t changed/nishtaneh 
&ldquo;enough&rdquo; from the corn which it came from. This rationale is the 
basis for some hashgachos&rsquo; certification and/or acceptance of certain 
productions ofMSG, aspartame and xanthan gum for Pesach. Some argue that 
Mishnah Berurah&rsquo;s ruling is limited to cases of b&rsquo;dieved and 
doesn&rsquo;t justify the l&rsquo;chatchilah creation/certification of such an 
item, and others argue that nishtaneh may be limited to cases where the 
forbidden item becomes inedible in the middle of its conversion to the 
&ldquo;new&rdquo; item. We will see below that even those who take the strict 
position in this matter generally agree that foods created with these 
ingredients are b&rsquo;dieved permitted on Pesach.</p> 
<p><b>Halachos of kitnios</b></p> 
<p>The minhag to not eat kitnios begins on Erev Pesach at the same time that 
one may not eat chametz (Shevet HaLeviIII:31 citing Chok Yaakov 471:2 and 
others). Although one may not eat kitnios, one may own and derive benefit from 
kitnios. Therefore, on Pesach one may keep cans of sweet corn in their property 
or feed millet to their parrot. Additionally, children, people who are ill, and 
people whose diet is otherwise restricted and must eat kitnios, are excluded 
from the minhag and may do so after consulting with a Rav. This halacha is 
quite relevant to baby formulas and nutritional supplements (e.g. Ensure) which 
invariably contain kitnios, and are usually used by people who have few 
non-kitnios choices, if any. When such foods are used on Pesach they should be 
prepared in special non-Pesach and non-chametz utensils, which should not be 
washed with the Pesach dishes. [It must be noted that although the halacha is 
quite lenient in permitting children and the infirm to consume kitnios, the 
halacha is quite strict regarding the consumption of chametz, and one must 
therefore be sure that the product is truly chametz-free before consuming it. 
The subject of determining whether an item is merely kitnios or if it possibly 
contains chametz is beyond the scope of this article and will IY&rdquo;H be 
dealt with separately].</p> 
<p>Kitnios is batel b&rsquo;rov, which means that if someone accidentally put 
kitnios into their Pesach food, the food is b&rsquo;dieved permitted assuming 
the food contains more non-kitnios than kitnios (Rema 453:1 as per Mishnah 
Berurah 453:9). This means that although the food may have a pronounced taste 
of kitnios, the food is permitted (unless there are recognizable pieces of 
kitnios which haven&rsquo;t been removed). Therefore, if a beverage is 
sweetened with aspartame made of kitnios shenishtaneh, even those people who 
hold that aspartame is forbidden (as explained above) may drink the beverage 
because the aspartame is batel b&rsquo;rov in the other ingredients. Similarly, 
we have seen that there is a disagreement as to whether fenugreek is kitnios. 
Nonetheless, even those who follow the strict approach may consume maple syrup 
which is flavored with fenugreek (as it often is) because it is batel 
b&rsquo;rov. Thus, although we&rsquo;ve seen a number of disagreements as to 
whether certain foods are or aren&rsquo;t kitnios, those disagreements are 
limited to one who wants to consume the actual item (or a hashgachah certifying 
someone else who is intentionally putting the ingredient into a food), but 
these disagreements rarely affect consumers.</p> 
<p><b>Other Minhagim</b></p> 
<p>In addition to the well-known minhag of not eating kitnios, the Rema 
(467:8) cites customs to not eat honey, raisins, dried fruit, sugar, saffron 
and cloves, and other Poskim cite numerous other customs from specific 
communities. Many of these minhagim are limited to cases where the person 
doesn&rsquo;t know for sure that the product doesn&rsquo;t contain chametz, and 
therefore many of these minhagim are not practiced nowadays because the 
hashgachah on the food guarantees that it is chametz-free. As with all matters 
of halacha, one who is unsure as to whether a family or community custom 
remains in effect, should consult with their Rav.</p> Back to OU Passover Home

<h1>Which Foods are Chametz?</h1> 
<p>By: Rabbi Dovid Cohen</p> 
<p>One of the last jobs of cleaning the house for Pesach is to get all chametz 
out of the kitchen. Of course, the first things to be removed are those that 
are obviously chametz &ndash; bread, pasta, cookies, crackers, pretzels etc. 
Other foods can be identified by simply reading the ingredient panel, which 
shows that breakfast cereal, soy sauce, fish sticks, licorice, candy and many 
other foods often have wheat or flour (chametz) listed prominently. But only 
the most astute readers realize that the vinegar in their ketchup, the vitamins 
in the rice or milk, and the flavor in their favorite snack may in fact contain 
chametz. The goal of this article is to educate the reader of the many foods 
which potentially contain chametz, beginning with the more obvious and 
progressing to the more obscure.</p> 
<p><b>Flour, oats and barley</b></p> 
<p>If one of the five grains &ndash; wheat, barley, rye, oats and spelt 
&ndash; sits in water for more than 18 minutes it becomes chametz, and one may 
not eat, derive benefit from or own it on Pesach. In addition, Ashkenazim 
don&rsquo;t eat kitnios &ndash; a group of foods which includes (among other 
things) rice, corn, soy and their derivatives &ndash; but are allowed to own 
kitnios foods on Pesach.</p> 
<p>It is common practice that before wheat is ground into flour, the wheat 
kernels are tempered with water for many hours, and therefore flour should be 
treated as chametz (Mishnah Berurah 453:24). [In fact, matzah which isn&rsquo;t 
baked especially for Pesach is made from tempered wheat and should also be 
treated as chametz!]. Similarly, all oats are heat-treated to prevent them from 
becoming rancid; if this heating is done with &ldquo;wet&rdquo; steam, the 
oats/oatmeal may be chametz. On the other hand, barley (a.k.a. pearled barley) 
is processed without water, and therefore a standard bag of barley isn&rsquo;t 
chametz. However, some barley is steeped in water until the barley begins to 
sprout; this creates a product known as barley malt (a.k.a. malted barley, 
malt) which is definitely chametz.</p> 
<p><b>Yeast</b></p> 
<p>The Torah says that one may not own se&rsquo;or on Pesach. Are se&rsquo;or 
and yeast the same thing? A quick lesson in bread baking will surprisingly show 
that se&rsquo;or is yeast but yeast isn&rsquo;t necessarily se&rsquo;or!</p> 
<p>Although a grain which soaks in water for 18 minutes is chametz, in order 
to make good bread one needs yeast. Yeast is the living microorganism which 
converts some of the flour into the carbon dioxide which fluffs-up the batter 
and causes it to &ldquo;rise&rdquo;. The air we breathe contains yeast, and 
therefore if one makes a batter of flour and water it&rsquo;ll eventually rise 
even if no yeast is added, because yeast from the atmosphere will find their 
way into the batter. But most bakers don&rsquo;t have the patience to wait all 
day for their bread to rise, so they add their own yeast into the batter to 
speed things up a bit.</p> 
<p>The traditional method of collecting/creating yeast is as follows. Every 
day the baker would take one handful of dough out of the batter and not bake 
it. As the day went on, the yeast in that dough would multiply (and be joined 
by other yeast found in the air) to such an extent that that the batter would 
turn sour and inedible. This ball of concentrated yeast would be thrown into 
the next day&rsquo;s batter to help that batter rise (and a handful of that 
batter would be taken out to be saved for the next day&hellip; ) . In English 
this concentrated yeast-ball is called &ldquo;sourdough&rdquo; due to its 
awfully-sour taste, and this is what the Torah calls se&rsquo;or and forbids 
one from owning on Pesach.</p> 
<p>However, one can also collect yeast from plant sources and produce it via 
fermentation. If yeast doesn&rsquo;t contain any ingredients from the 5 grains 
(as it often doesn&rsquo;t) it isn&rsquo;t chametz even though it has the same 
characteristics as se&rsquo;or (see Mechiltah 9:19 on Sh&rsquo;mos 12:19) and 
one may own it on Pesach. [The process of &ldquo;fermentation&rdquo; and the 
possible chametz concerns it raises will be discussed below]. Thus, se&rsquo;or 
is concentrated yeast but the yeast which is commonly sold in stores is not 
se&rsquo;or.</p> 
<p>Brewer&rsquo;s yeast is yeast recovered from beer production (discussed 
below). It is similar to se&rsquo;or and one may not own it (derive benefit 
from it or eat it) on Pesach.</p> 
<p><b>Beer and whisky</b></p> 
<p>If barley is soaked in water under proper conditions, it ferments into 
beer, and since the barley sat in water for more than 18 minutes, beer is 
chametz (Shulchan Aruch 442:5). Beer contains approximately 5% alcohol and 
people who want a drink with a higher alcohol content do the following. The 
grain is allowed to ferment until it reaches about 12-13% and then the alcohol 
is separated from (some of) the water using a process called 
&ldquo;distillation&rdquo; to produce whisky which contains 30-95% alcohol. The 
consensus of the Poskim is that whisky produced from one of the 5 grains is 
considered chametz even though it went through the process of distillation (see 
Shulchan Aruch Y.D. 92:8 &amp; 123:24, and Mishnah Berurah 442:4). Even if the 
whisky is made from corn or another kitnios grain, there are a number of other 
reasons why it may be chametz:</p> 
<p>1. The watery liquid that remains after distillation is called 
&ldquo;backset&rdquo; and is often used in creating another batch of whisky. 
Thus, even if the grain used in creating the whisky is kitnios, the water may 
be from a chametz whisky.</p> 
<p>2. Before the yeast ferments the grain, the grain&rsquo;s starch must be 
broken-down into individual glucose molecules, and this is traditionally done 
with barley malt (discussed above). Since the chametz barley malt plays such a 
crucial role in the creation of the whisky (and also dramatically changes the 
taste of the grain before it is fermented), the barley malt is considered a 
davar hama&rsquo;amid and one may not own such whisky on Pesach (see Shulchan 
Aruch 442:5 and Mishnah Berurah 442:25).</p> 
<p>As such, all types of whisky should be treated as chametz unless they are 
specifically certified as kosher for Pesach.</p> 
<p><b>Vinegar</b></p> 
<p>Vinegar is created when alcohol is (re)fermented, and the primary concern 
with vinegar is the source of the alcohol. As the name implies, malt vinegar is 
made from malt or beer which we&rsquo;ve seen is chametz, and therefore malt 
vinegar is definitely chametz. In contrast, wine vinegar and apple cider 
vinegar are made from wine and apple cider which aren&rsquo;t chametz. However, 
due to the possibility that the equipment used and/or the processing aids are 
chametz, it is prudent to only consume wine or apple cider vinegar which is 
certified as kosher for Pesach.</p> 
<p>The more difficult question is the Pesach status of white distilled 
vinegar, as follows. White distilled vinegar is made from distilled alcohol 
(described above) and the most serious concern is whether the grain used was 
chametz (e.g. wheat), kitnios (e.g. corn), or something innocuous (e.g. 
potatoes). Additional concerns stem from questions about the equipment, 
enzymes, yeasts, and nutrients used in creating the alcohol and vinegar. [The 
nutrients are generally batel b&rsquo;shishim but some Poskim hold that since 
they are intentionally added to the vinegar they aren&rsquo;t batel; this 
issue, discussed in Magen Avraham 442:1, Nodah B&rsquo;yehudah Y.D. II:56, 
Mishnah Berurah 447:14 and others, is beyond the scope of this article]. In 
addition, the fermentation of vinegar always begins with a 
&ldquo;starter&rdquo; taken from a previous batch of vinegar (similar to the 
way se&rsquo;or is used) and if that starter is chametz, the entire batch will 
be forbidden.</p> 
<p>The question of whether grain-based/distilled vinegar is chametz has 
far-reaching implications because many foods are preserved with vinegar (e.g. 
pickles, olives) and vinegar is a prime ingredient in many condiments (e.g. 
ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, salad dressing), and in general it is distilled 
vinegar which is used in these applications. Certainly, any food containing 
vinegar shouldn&rsquo;t be consumed on Pesach unless the food is specifically 
certified for Pesach use. But do the concerns with vinegar mean that we must 
destroy or sell all of the products in my pantry which contain vinegar?</p> 
<p>As a result of the concerns outlined above, many Rabbonim recommend that 
people whose minhag is to not sell chametz gamur, shouldn&rsquo;t sell (or 
retain possession) of vinegar-containing products on Pesach. However, others 
with knowledge of the food industry argue that due to the abundance of corn in 
the United States, the overwhelming majority of the vinegar sold and used in 
the United States does not contain chametz (although it does contain kitnios). 
Therefore, since there isn&rsquo;t any reasonable way for the average consumer 
to figure out whether the vinegar in their ketchup (for example) is chametz, 
they may rely on the rov (majority) and assume that the vinegar is not chametz 
at least to the extent that it may/should be sold to a non-Jew. As with all 
matters of halacha, one should consult with their local Rav. It is noteworthy 
that the aforementioned leniency does not necessarily apply to (a) vinegar or 
vinegar-containing products from other countries and (b) organic vinegar (even 
if it is produced in the United States, due to the difficulty in obtaining 
organic corn).</p> 
<p>Pesach products are generally made with white distilled vinegar which is 
specially-made without any chametz or kitnios concerns. However, some companies 
choose to substitute glacial acetic acid for the vinegar in their Pesach 
products. Glacial acetic acid is chemically identical to vinegar, but is made 
from petroleum feedstock as opposed to being fermented, and poses little Pesach 
concern.</p> 
<p><b>Enzymes, vitamins, flavors and other complex issues</b></p> 
<p>Microbiology has played a great role in the advances in food technology in 
the past few decades. Food scientists have identified numerous microorganisms 
which can either serve as or help to create, enzymes (see below), vitamins 
(e.g. Riboflavin, Vitamin B12), flavorful chemicals (e.g.MSG) and other items 
(e.g. xanthan gum, citric acid, yeast). In addition, scientists have learnt new 
ways to react chemicals with one another (and use other methods) to create 
emulsifiers, acidulants, sweeteners, flavors and other chemicals (e.g. 
polysorbates, ascorbic acid, aspartame, esters, magnesium citrate). This 
technology has allowed food scientists to create an array of foods which were 
inconceivable 50 years ago, and to improve on the way that they produce 
&ldquo;older&rdquo; foods.</p> 
<p>Of all these items, enzymes have arguably had the most far-reaching affect. 
Enzymes are chemicals which act as a catalyst for change in other items. A 
common example is rennet which causes milk to coagulate into cheese, but the 
range of uses goes well beyond cheese. One enzyme liquefies and sweetens corn 
into corn syrup so that another enzyme can make it even sweeter and become the 
high fructose corn syrup used to sweeten soft drinks. An enzyme is used to 
create the &ldquo;right&rdquo; kind of sugar molecule so that hard-candies 
won&rsquo;t stick to the wrapper, and a different one makes sure that beer 
doesn&rsquo;t get cloudy when its put in the refrigerator.</p> 
<p>The kashrus issues raised by all of this technology is beyond the scope of 
this article, but one issue is quite relevant to our discussion. One of the 
prime ingredients used in making just about all of the items discussed above is 
&ldquo;glucose&rdquo; (a.k.a. sugar), and glucose can be created from any 
starch, which means that these items may be wheat (chametz), corn or rice 
(kitnios), sweet potatoes (kosher for Pesach) or something else, depending on 
what is available in the country where the glucose is being produced. This 
issue is further complicated by the emergence of the &ldquo;global 
marketplace&rdquo; where it may be cheaper to buy xanthan gum from France or 
China than from the local producer. Additionally, many of the ingredients 
listed above are used in tiny proportions which would theoretically be batel 
b&rsquo;shishim, and Poskim have taken different positions as to which of these 
serve as a davar hama&rsquo;amid and/or a milsah d&rsquo;avidah lit&rsquo;amah, 
which can&rsquo;t be batel.</p> 
<p>In light of the seriousness of eating chametz on Pesach, its obvious that 
no one would consider eating any food on Pesach which contains (or may contain) 
any of these ingredients, unless the food is certified as kosher for Pesach. 
[Many children and adults must consume baby formula, soy/rice beverages or 
nutritional supplements (which cannot be certified for Pesach since they 
contain kitnios) and require information as to whether those items contain 
chametz. That issue is beyond the scope of this article and will IY&rdquo;H be 
dealt with separately]. Some Rabbonim say that for the same reason one 
shouldn&rsquo;t own any of these items on Pesach, but as noted above regarding 
vinegar, others argue that one may rely on the fact that the overwhelming 
majority of these items sold and used in the United States do not contain 
chametz (although they contain kitnios). As with all matters of halacha, one 
should consult with their local Rav.</p>

<h1>Gluten Intolerance, Celiac, Allergies And Pesach</h1> 
<p>By: Rabbi Avraham Juravel</p> 
<p><i>Pesach</i> <i>Kashrus</i> professionals are familiar with the 
intricacies of ingredients and food production. Often, consumers who have 
health concerns contact<i>kashrus</i> agencies in order to obtain information 
about foods and ingredients. This is especially true when it comes to<i>Pesach
</i>. Before <i>Pesach</i>, the consumer information lines at the major <i>
Kashrus</i> agencies are constantly ringing. Many of these consumers ask 
question about<i>Pesach</i> and their health needs. This article will discuss 
some of the ways in which<i>Pesach</i> certified foods may impact on health 
issues. However, it is important to note that<i>kashrus</i> agencies and <i>
Rabbonim</i> are not health specialists. Persons who need guidance with respect 
to health matters should obtain advice from qualified health specialists, not 
from<i>kashrus</i> agencies. </p> 
<p><b>Wheat</b></p> 
<p>It is important to be aware if the problem is gluten intolerance, celiac, 
or a true allergy. These three conditions vary significantly. Gluten 
intolerance is a nuisance. If wheat gluten is consumed by a gluten intolerant 
person the results may be stomach aches, diarrhea, and general malaise. Similar 
symptoms are experienced by people who suffer from a celiac condition, however, 
the similarity stops here. Celiac is a malabsorption problem that affects the 
intestines. Ingesting gluten triggers their immune system to launch an attack 
on the small intestine. Thus, every time a person with celiac consumes gluten, 
the small intestines are damaged. The long term cumulative effects of consuming 
gluten can be devastating for a celiac person. Consequently, such an individual 
must not consume any gluten. Celiac is not a life threatening disease. However, 
allergies can be life threatening. An allergic person exposed to an allergen 
could experience an anaphylactic shock and stop breathing. Therefore, one must 
be aware whether wheat must be avoided because of gluten intolerance, celiac 
disease or allergies.</p> 
<p>The US government has determined that an item is &lsquo;gluten free&rsquo; 
at 20 ppm (parts per million) of gluten. For allergies, the threshold is 0 ppm. 
I would strongly recommend that anyone with an allergy to wheat or celiac 
disease ascertain whether the manufacturer uses matzo meal or cake meal in 
other products. If the answer is positive, it is likely that even the items not 
containing matzo meal may contain some gluten that can even exceed the 
government threshold.</p> 
<p>There is no substitute for reading labels. Wheat can be listed as matzo, 
matzo meal, cake meal, farfel, egg matzo or matzo balls. Even after all is said 
and done, there are numerous safe items available for<i>Pesach</i>, which 
include but are not limited to, candies, chocolate, catsup, jam, jelly, 
spaghetti and even pizza. In fact, there are more wheat free products available 
for<i>Pesach</i> than during the rest of the year. A significant number of 
people that suffer from gluten related conditions, Jewish and non Jewish, take 
advantage of the many gluten free products available for<i>Pesach</i> .</p> 
<p>For those suffering from wheat allergies, or celiac disease, who are 
contemplating a vacation at a Passover certified hotel, it would be prudent to 
limit themselves to a non-<i>gebroks</i> program. This means that no matzo or 
matzo based product (such as matzo meal) will be used in any food preparation 
in the kitchen. There will be wheat based matzo served with the meals but it 
will not be used in the kitchen in food preparation. Matzo will be placed in a 
box on the table. While there are programs that advertise &ldquo;non-<i>gebroks
</i>&rdquo; available, it would not be safe for someone who is allergic to 
wheat or a celiac person to participate in such a program. As we discussed 
earlier, gluten free products must meet a threshold of less than 20 ppm (parts 
per million) gluten. For allergies, this 20 ppm threshold is not sufficient. 
The number needed isZERO. A kitchen that is preparing both <i>gebroks</i> and 
<i>non-gebroks</i> food would have difficulty meeting this standard.</p> 
<p>It is feasible for allergic and celiac people to be at a hotel for 
Passover. If they gather a group with sufficient numbers, then a small hotel 
can host them. I know of several hotels that operate Passover programs for 
small crowds of 100-150 people. It takes some time to organize such a group, 
but it can be done. Nothing is impossible.</p> 
<p><b>Nuts</b></p> 
<p>Tree nuts are also considered an allergen. Typically, nuts are used in 
charoses. It is customary to use both almonds and walnuts in charoses. For 
someone allergic to nuts, I would recommend the recipe for<i>charoses</i> be 
apples, figs, dates, pomegranates, and wine. There is no question that the<i>
mitzvah</i> of <i>charoses</i> can be fulfilled by using this recipe. Peanuts 
are also a common allergen. However, even though Rav Moshe Feinstein writes 
that peanuts are not<i>Kitniyos</i>, most Jews of <i>Ashkenzic</i> extraction 
do not use peanuts on<i>Pesach</i>. </p> 
<p>Consumers who are concerned about nuts should know that kernel paste is 
another name for ground nuts. Most Passover certified bakeries use kernel paste 
as a base for their products. Most of the cakes and cookies certified Kosher 
for Passover contain nuts in some form or another. A person allergic to nuts 
should avoid commercially baked products. Even if a bakery produces cakes and 
cookies without nuts, as long as nuts are used in the facility it may be 
dangerous for an allergic person to eat them. It is quite possible that the ppm 
of nuts in the air is quite high. This does not imply that an allergic person 
cannot eat any cake or cookies on<i>Pesach</i>. There are many recipes for 
different types of cakes and cookies that do not contain nuts. You may be 
surprised by how many different types of pastries can be produced from potato 
starch, eggs, oil, sugar, honey, cocoa, salt and spices. Sponge cakes, marble 
cakes, chocolate loaves, brownies, jelly rolls, seven layer cake, and cookies 
are only some of the items that can be made without any nuts.</p> 
<p><b>Dairy</b></p> 
<p>For those with an allergy to dairy products, chocolate should not be part 
of their diet year round; not just on Passover. Although there are chocolate 
products that are certified parve, however, for allergies no chances should be 
taken. Most chocolate manufacturers who produce both dairy and parve products 
have separate lines for the dairy and the parve products. However, separate 
lines do not guarantee a dairy-free product. At some facilities, the separate 
lines start at the later stage of processing, such as the refiners and conches, 
where the product is heated, and not at the earlier stages where the powder 
mixers can be used for both dairy and parve powders. While the mixers are 
adequately cleaned out between the dairy and parve mixes in order to allow the 
mix to be called parve, however, from an allergen point of view, it is woefully 
inadequate. The next part of the chocolate process to share equipment is the 
mold. Since the liquid chocolate poured into the mold is not very hot 
(generally less than 100 degrees), a cleanup, rather than a full koshering 
suffices. From an allergen standpoint , there are probably more than 0 ppm in 
parve chocolate. Whether it is<i>Pesach</i> or all year around, someone 
allergic to dairy should refrain from chocolate.</p> 
<p>The importance of reading the ingredient statement on the label of any 
manufactured food cannot be understated. If a person has an allergy to any food 
product, whether it is wheat, eggs, nuts, dairy, or whatever, he may be taking 
his life into his hands by not reading labels. I would recommend that he carry 
a magnifying glass with him in order to read the small print. Remember, as one 
ages, the print seems to become smaller.</p> 
<p>Let me end this article by wishing everyone a Kosher and healthy <i>Pesach
</i> . Remember, there is no place in the Torah that requires one to become 
sick during<i>Pesach</i>. If there are health issues involved, please consult a 
health specialist and your<i>Rav</i>.</p> <br>
