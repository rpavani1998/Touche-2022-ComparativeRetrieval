<h1>Hemp: A New Crop with New Uses for North America*</h1> 
<p><strong>Ernest Small and David Marcus</strong></p> 
<p>*This paper was considerably improved by criticism provided by A. McElroy.
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Hemp&rdquo; refers primarily to&nbsp;<em>Cannabis sativa</em>
&nbsp;L. (Cannabaceae), although the term has been applied to dozens of species 
representing at least 22 genera, often prominentfiber crops. For examples, 
Manila hemp (abaca) is<em>Musa textilis</em>&nbsp;N&eacute;e, sisal hemp 
is&nbsp;<em>Agave sisalina</em>&nbsp;Perrine, and sunn hemp is&nbsp;<em>
Crotolaria juncea</em>&nbsp;L. Especially confusing is the phrase &ldquo;Indian 
hemp,&rdquo; which has been used both for narcotic Asian land races of&nbsp;<em>
C. sativa</em>&nbsp;(so-called&nbsp;<em>C. indica</em>&nbsp;Lamarck of India) 
and&nbsp;<em>Apocynum cannabinum</em>&nbsp;L., which was used by North American 
Indians as a fiber plant.&nbsp;<em>Cannabis sativa</em>&nbsp;is a multi-purpose 
plant that has been domesticated for bast (phloem) fiber in the stem, a 
multi-purpose fixed oil in the &ldquo;seeds&rdquo; (achenes), and an 
intoxicating resin secreted by epidermal glands. The common names hemp and 
marijuana (much less frequently spelled marihuana) have been applied loosely to 
all three forms, although historically hemp has been used primarily for the 
fiber cultigen and its fiber preparations, and marijuana for the drug cultigen 
and its drug preparations. The current hemp industry is making great efforts to 
point out that &ldquo;hemp is not marijuana.&rdquo; Italicized,&nbsp;<em>
Cannabis</em>&nbsp;refers to the biological name of the plant (only one species 
of this genus is commonly recognized,&nbsp;<em>C. sativa</em>&nbsp;L.). 
Non-italicized, &ldquo;cannabis&rdquo; is a generic abstraction, widely used as 
a noun and adjective, and commonly (often loosely) used both for cannabis 
plants and/or any or all of the intoxicant preparations made from them.</p> 
<p>Probably indigenous to temperate Asia,&nbsp;<em>C. sativa</em>&nbsp;is the 
most widely cited example of a &ldquo;camp follower.&rdquo; It was pre-adapted 
to thrive in the manured soils around man&rsquo;s early settlements, which 
quickly led to its domestication (Schultes 1970). Hemp was harvested by the 
Chinese 8500 years ago (Schultes and Hofmann 1980). For most of its 
history,&nbsp;<em>C. sativa</em>&nbsp;was most valued as a fiber source, 
considerably less so as an intoxicant, and only to a limited extent as an 
oilseed crop. Hemp is one of the oldest sources of textile fiber, with extant 
remains of hempen cloth trailing back 6 millennia. Hemp grown for fiber was 
introduced to western Asia and Egypt, and subsequently to Europe somewhere 
between 1000 and 2000&nbsp;BCE. Cultivation in Europe became widespread after 
500 ce. The crop was first brought to South America in 1545, in Chile, and to 
North America in Port Royal, Acadia in 1606. The hemp industry flourished in 
Kentucky, Missouri, and Illinois between 1840 and 1860 because of the strong 
demand for sailcloth and cordage (Ehrensing 1998). From the end of the Civil 
War until 1912, virtually all hemp in the US was produced in Kentucky. During 
World War I, some hemp cultivation occurred in several states, including 
Kentucky, Wisconsin, California, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, 
Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Kansas, and Iowa (Ehrensing 1998). The 
second world war led to a brief revival of hemp cultivation in the Midwest, as 
well as in Canada, because the war cut off supplies of fiber (substantial 
renewed cultivation also occurred in Germany for the same reason). Until the 
beginning of the 19th century, hemp was the leading cordage fiber. Until the 
middle of the 19th century, hemp rivaled flax as the chief textile fiber of 
vegetable origin, and indeed was described as &ldquo;the king of fiber-bearing 
plants,&mdash;the standard by which all other fibers are measured&rdquo; (Boyce 
1900). Nevertheless, theMarihuana Tax Act applied in 1938 essentially ended 
hemp production in the United States, although a small hemp fiber industry 
continued in Wisconsin until 1958. Similarly in 1938 the cultivation of&nbsp;
<em>Cannabis</em>&nbsp;became illegal in Canada under the Opium and Narcotics 
Act.</p> 
<p>Hemp, grown under license mostly in Canada, is the most publicized 
&ldquo;new&rdquo; crop in North America. Until very recently the prohibition 
against drug forms of the plant prevented consideration of cultivation of fiber 
and oilseed cultivars in Canada. However, in the last 10 years three key 
developments occurred: (1) much-publicized recent advances in the legal 
cultivation of hemp in western Europe, especially for new value-added products; 
(2) enterprising farmers and farm groups became convinced of the agricultural 
potential of hemp in Canada, and obtained permits to conduct experimental 
cultivation; and (3) lobby groups convinced the government of Canada that 
narcotic forms of the hemp plant are distinct and distinguishable from fiber 
and oilseed forms. In March 1998, new regulations (under theControlled Drugs 
and Substances Act) were provided to allow the commercial development of a hemp 
industry in Canada, and since then more than a thousand licenses have been 
issued. Hectares licensed for cultivation for 1998&ndash;2001 were 
respectively, 2,500, 14,200, 5,487, and 1,355, the decreasing trend due to a 
glut of seed produced in 1999 and pessimism over new potential regulations 
barring exports to the US. Information on the commercial potential of hemp in 
Canada is in Blade (1998), Marcus (1998), and Pinfold Consulting (1998). In the 
US, a substantial trade in hemp products has developed, based on imports of 
hemp fiber, grain, and oil. The American agricultural community has observed 
this, and has had success at the state level in persuading legislators of the 
advisability of experimental hemp cultivation as a means of evaluating the 
wisdom of re-establishing American hemp production. However, because of 
opposition by the federal government, to date there has only been a small 
experimental plot in Hawaii. Information on the commercial potential of hemp in 
the US is presented in the following.</p> 
<p><em>Cannabis sativa</em>&nbsp;is extremely unusual in the diversity of 
products for which it is or can be cultivated. Popular Mechanics magazine 
(1938) touted hemp as &ldquo;the new billion dollar crop,&rdquo; stating that 
it &ldquo;can be used to produce more than 25,000 products, ranging from 
dynamite to Cellophane.&rdquo; Table 1 presents the principal products for 
which the species is cultivated in Europe, all of which happen to be based on 
fiber. This presentation stresses the products that hold the most promise for 
North America, which also include a considerable range of oilseed applications

<h2>BASIC CATEGORIES OF&nbsp;<em>CANNABIS</em>&nbsp;AND THEIR FIELD 
ARCHITECTURE</h2> 
<p><em>Cannabis sativa</em>&nbsp;is an annual wind-pollinated plant, normally 
dioecious and dimorphic, although sometimes monoecious (mostly in several 
modern European fiber cultivars). Figure 2 presents the basic morphology of the 
species. Some special hybrids, obtained by pollinating females of dioecious 
lines with pollen from monoecious plants, are predominantly female (so-called 
&ldquo;all-female,&rdquo; these generally also produce some hermaphrodites and 
occasional males). All-female lines are productive for some purposes (e.g. they 
are very uniform, and with very few males to take up space they can produce 
considerable grain), but the hybrid seed is expensive to produce. Staminate or 
&ldquo;male&rdquo; plants tend to be 10%&ndash;15% taller and are less robust 
than the pistillate or &ldquo;female&rdquo; (note the comparatively frail male 
in Fig. 3). So prolific is pollen production that an isolation distance of 
about 5 km is usually recommended for generating pure-bred foundation seed. A 
&ldquo;perigonal bract&rdquo; subtends each female flower, and grows to envelop 
the fruit. While small, secretory, resin-producing glands occur on the 
epidermis of most of the above-ground parts of the plant, the glands are very 
dense and productive on the perigonal bracts, which are accordingly of central 
interest in marijuana varieties. The root is a laterally branched taproot, 
generally 30&ndash;60 cm deep, up to 2.5 m in loose soils, very near the 
surface and more branched in wet soils. Extensive root systems are key to the 
ability of hemp crops to exploit deep supplies of nutrients and water. The 
stems are erect, furrowed, and usually branched, with a woody interior, and may 
be hollow in the internodes. Although the stem is often woody, the species is 
frequently referred to as a herb or forb. Plants vary enormously in height 
depending on genetic constitution and environment (Fig. 4), but are typically 
1&ndash;5 m (heights of 12 m or more in cultivation have been claimed).</p>

plant is shown at left, and a short narcotic variety (identified as 
&ldquo;Panama Gold&rdquo;) at right. <br>
<br>

<p>There is great variation in&nbsp;<em>Cannabis sativa</em>, because of 
disruptive domestication for fiber, oilseed, and narcotic resin, and there are 
features that tend to distinguish these three cultigens (cultivated phases) 
from each other. Moreover, density of cultivation is used to accentuate certain 
architectural features. Figure 5 illustrates the divergent appearances of the 
basic agronomic categories of&nbsp;<em>Cannabis</em>&nbsp;in typical field 
configurations.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Fig. 5.&nbsp;</strong>Typical architecture of categories of 
cultivated&nbsp;<em>Cannabis sativa</em>. Top left: narcotic plants are 
generally low, highly branched, and grown well-spaced. Top right: plants grown 
for oilseed were traditionally well-spaced, and the plants developed medium 
height and strong branching. Bottom left: fiber cultivars are grown at high 
density, and are unbranched and very tall. Bottom center: &ldquo;dual 
purpose&rdquo; plants are grown at moderate density, tend to be slightly 
branched and of medium to tall height. Bottom right: some recent oilseed 
cultivars are grown at moderate density and are short and relatively 
unbranched. Degree of branching and height are determined both by the density 
of the plants and their genetic background.</p> 
<p>Highly selected forms of the fiber cultigen possess features maximizing 
fiber production. Since the nodes tend to disrupt the length of the fiber 
bundles, thereby limiting quality, tall, relatively unbranched plants with long 
internodes have been selected. Another strategy has been to select stems that 
are hollow at the internodes, with limited wood, since this maximizes 
production of fiber in relation to supporting woody tissues. Similarly, limited 
seed productivity concentrates the plant&rsquo;s energy into production of 
fiber, and fiber cultivars often have low genetic propensity for seed output. 
Selecting monoecious strains overcomes the problem of differential maturation 
times and quality of male (staminate) and female (pistillate) plants (males 
mature 1&ndash;3 weeks earlier). Male plants in general are taller, albeit 
slimmer, less robust, and less productive. Except for the troublesome 
characteristic of dying after anthesis, male traits are favored for fiber 
production, in contrast to the situation for drug strains noted below. In 
former, labor-intensive times, the male plants were harvested earlier than the 
females, to produce superior fiber. The limited branching of fiber cultivars is 
often compensated for by possession of large leaves with wide leaflets, which 
obviously increase the photosynthetic ability of the plants. Since fiber plants 
have not generally been selected for narcotic purposes, the level of 
intoxicating constituents is usually limited.</p> 
<p>An absence of such fiber-strain traits as tallness, limited branching, long 
internodes, and very hollow stems, is characteristic of narcotic strains. Drug 
forms have historically been grown in areas south of the north-temperate zone, 
often close to the equator, and are photoperiodically adapted to a long season. 
When grown in north-temperate climates maturation is much-delayed until late 
fall, or the plants succumb to cold weather before they are able to produce 
seeds. Unlike fiber strains that have been selected to grow well at extremely 
high densities, drug strains tend to be less persistent when grown in high 
concentration (de Meijer 1994). Drug strains can be very similar in appearance 
to fiber strains. However, a characteristic type of narcotic plant was selected 
in southern Asia, particularly in India and neighboring countries. This is 
dioecious, short (about a meter in height), highly branched, with large leaves 
(i.e. wide leaflets), and it is slow to mature. The appearance is rather like a 
short, conical Christmas tree.</p> 
<p>Until recent times, the cultivation of hemp primarily as an oilseed was 
largely unknown, except in Russia. Today, it is difficult to reconstruct the 
type of plant that was grown there as an oilseed, because such cultivation has 
essentially been abandoned. Oilseed hemp cultivars in the modern sense were not 
available until very recently, but some land races certainly were grown 
specifically for seeds in Russia. Dewey (1914) gave the following information: 
&ldquo;The short oil-seed hemp with slender stems, about 30 inches high, 
bearing compact clusters of seeds and maturing in 60 to 90 days, is of little 
value for fiber production, but the experimental plants, grown from seed 
imported from Russia, indicate that it may be valuable as an oil-seed crop to 
be harvested and threshed in the same manner as oil-seed flax.&rdquo; Most hemp 
oilseed in Europe is currently obtained from so-called &ldquo;dual usage&rdquo; 
plants (employed for harvest of both stem fiber and seeds, from the same 
plants). Of the European dual-usage cultivars, &lsquo;Uniko B&rsquo; and 
&lsquo;Fasamo&rsquo; are particularly suited to being grown as oilseeds. Very 
recently, cultivars have been bred specifically for oilseed production. These 
include &lsquo;Finola,&rsquo; formerly known as &lsquo;Fin-314&rsquo; (Fig. 6) 
and &lsquo;Anka&rsquo; (Fig. 7), which are relatively short, little-branched, 
mature early in north-temperate regions, and are ideal for high-density 
planting and harvest with conventional equipment. Dewey (1914) noted that a 
Turkish narcotic type of land race called &ldquo;Smyrna&rdquo; was commonly 
used in the early 20th century in the US to produce birdseed, because (like 
most narcotic types of&nbsp;<em>Cannabis</em>) it is densely branched, 
producing many flowers, hence seeds. While oilseed land races in northern 
Russia would have been short, early-maturing plants in view of the short 
growing season, in more southern areas oilseed landraces likely had moderate 
height, and were spaced more widely to allow abundant branching and seed 
production to develop. Until Canada replaced China in 1998 as a source of 
imported seeds for the US, most seeds used for various purposes in the US were 
sterilized and imported from China. Indeed, China remains the largest producer 
of hempseed. We have grown Chinese hemp land races, and these were short, 
branched, adapted to a very long growing season (i.e. they come into flower 
very slowly in response to photoperiodic induction of short days in the fall), 
and altogether they were rather reminiscent of Dewey&rsquo;s description of 
Smyrna. Although similar in appearance to narcotic strains of&nbsp;<em>C. sativa
</em>, the Chinese land races we grew were in fact low in intoxicating 
constituents, and it may well be that what Dewey thought was a narcotic strain 
was not. Although some forms of&nbsp;<em>C. sativa</em>&nbsp;have quite large 
seeds, until recently oilseed forms appear to have been mainly selected for a 
heavy yield of seeds, usually recognizable by abundant branching. Such forms 
are typically grown at lower densities than hemp grown only for fiber, as this 
promotes branching, although it should be understood that the genetic 
propensity for branching has been selected. Percentage or quality of oil in the 
seeds does not appear to have been important in the past, although selection 
for these traits is now being conducted. Most significantly, modern selection 
is occurring with regard to mechanized harvesting, particularly the ability to 
grow in high density as single-headed stalks with very short branches bearing 
considerable seed.</p> <br>

<h2>CONTROLLING THE DRUG ABUSE POTENTIAL OF HEMP</h2> 
<p>As detailed below, the development of hemp as a new legal crop in North 
America must be considered in relation to illicit cultivation, so it is 
important to appreciate the scope of the drug situation. Up until the first 
half of the 20th century, drug preparations of&nbsp;<em>Cannabis</em>&nbsp;were 
used predominantly as a recreational inebriant in poor countries and the lower 
socio-economic classes of developed nations. After World War II, marijuana 
became associated with the rise of a hedonistic, psychedelic ethos, first in 
the United States and eventually over much of the world, with the consequent 
development of a huge international illicit market that exceeds the value of 
the hemp market during its heyday. Table 3 shows the &ldquo;economic 
significance&rdquo; (dollars generated in the black market plus dollar cost of 
control measures) of the illicit drug industry associated with&nbsp;<em>C. 
sativa</em>, and contrasts this with the estimated dollar value of major 
categories of legitimate uses. In the Netherlands, the annual value of narcotic 
hemp cultivation (ca. $10 billion) exceeds the value of tulips (Collins 1999). 
Marijuana has become the most widely disseminated illicit species in the world 
(Schultes and Hofmann 1980). With the exception of alcohol, it is the most 
widely used recreational euphoric drug. About 25% of North Americans are 
believed to have used&nbsp;<em>Cannabis</em>&nbsp;illegally. According to the 
US National Institute on Drug Abuse (www.nida.nih.gov/Infofax/marijuana.html), 
more than 72 million Americans (33%) 12 years of age and older have tried 
marijuana. Cultivation, commerce, and consumption of drug preparations of&nbsp;
<em>Cannabis</em>&nbsp;have been proscribed in most countries during the 
present century. The cost of enforcing the laws against&nbsp;<em>Cannabis</em>
&nbsp;in North America is in the billions of dollars annually. In addition, 
there are substantial social costs, such as adverse effects on users, 
particularly those who are convicted. Tragically this includes some legitimate 
farmers who, faced with financial ruin because of the unprofitability of crops 
being grown, converted to growing marijuana.</p>

Guzman 2001).</p> 
<p>A rather thorough analysis of the scope of the illicit marijuana industry 
in Canada for 1998 is reported at 
www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/html/drugsituation.htm#Marihuana and summarized in MacLeod 
(1999). At least 800 tonnes (t) of marijuana were grown in Canada in 1998, 
representing a harvest of 4.7 million flowering plants. More than 50% of the 
marijuana available in Canada is grown domestically. An average mature plant 
was estimated to produce 170 g of &ldquo;marketable substance.&rdquo; The value 
of the Canadian crop is uncertain, but has been estimated to be in the billions 
of dollars annually (Heading 1998; MacLeod 1999).</p> 
<p>The US Drug Enforcement Administration&rsquo;s online criminal justice 
statistics for 2000 (cscmosaic.albany.edu/sourcebook/1995/pdf/t440.pdf) shows 
the following seizures and eradication of plants of&nbsp;<em>C. sativa</em>: 
40,929 outdoor plots (2,597,796 plants), 139,580,728 ditchweed (ruderal 
plants), 2,361 indoor operations (217,105 plants), for a grand total of 2,814, 
903 plants destroyed. Impressively, the species was grown in all 50 states 
(including outdoor seizures in every state except Wyoming)! It is of course 
impossible to know exactly how much marijuana is cultivated in the United 
States, and perhaps only 10% to 20% of the amount grown is seized. The 
profitability of the illegal crop is indicated by a comparison of the cost of a 
bushel of corn (roughly $2.50) and a bushel of manicured marijuana (about 
$70,000; it has been suggested that prices range from $500 a pound, for 
low-quality marijuana, to more than $5,000 a pound for &ldquo;boutique&rdquo; 
strains like &ldquo;Northern Lights&rdquo; and &ldquo;Afghan Kush&rdquo;). 
According to a National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) 
(mir.drugtext.org/marijuananews/marijuana_ranks_fourth_largest_c.htm) marijuana 
is at least the fourth most valuable crop in America, outranked only by corn, 
soybeans, and hay. It was estimated that 8.7 million marijuana plants were 
harvested in 1997, worth $15.1 billion to growers and $25.2 billion on the 
retail market (the wholesale value was used to compare marijuana to other cash 
crops). Marijuana was judged to be the largest revenue producing crop in 
Alabama, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Kentucky, Maine, Rhode Island, 
Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia, and one of the top five cash crops in 
29 other states.</p> 
<p><em>Cannabis</em>&nbsp;contains a seemingly unique class of chemicals, the 
cannabinoids, of which more than 60 have been described, but only a few are 
psychoactive. Cannabinoids are produced in specialized epidermal glands, which 
differ notably in distribution on different organs of the plant (high 
concentrations occur on the upper surface of the young leaves and young twigs, 
on the tepals, stamens, and especially on the perigonal bract). Given this 
distribution, the glands would seem to be protective of young and reproductive 
above-ground tissues (the roots lack glands). Two classes of epidermal glands 
occur&mdash;stalked and sessile (Fig. 8), but in either case the glandular 
cells are covered by a sheath under which resin is accumulated, until the 
sheath ruptures, releasing resin on the surface. The resin is a sticky mixture 
of cannabinoids and a variety of terpenes. The characteristic odor of the plant 
is due to the abundant terpenes, which are not psychoactive. The more important 
cannabinoids are shown in Fig. 9. In the plant the cannabinoids exist 
predominantly in the form of carboxylic acids, which decarboxylate with time or 
when heated. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (D9-THC, or simply THC) is the 
predominant psychoactive component. Other THC isomers also occur, 
particularly&nbsp;D8-THC, which is also psychoactive. Technically, the euphoric 
psychological effects of THC are best described by the word psychotomimetic. 
Cannabidiol (CBD) is the chief non-psychotomimetic cannabinoid. A THC 
concentration in marijuana of approximately 0.9% has been suggested as a 
practical minimum level to achieve the (illegal) intoxicant effect, but CBD 
(the predominant cannabinoid of fiber and oilseed varieties) antagonizes (i.e. 
reduces) the effects of THC (Grotenhermen and Karus 1998). Concentrations of 
0.3% to 0.9% are considered to have &ldquo;only a small drug potential&rdquo; 
(Grotenhermen and Karus 1998). Some cannabinoid races have been described, 
notably containing cannabichromene (particularly in high-THC forms) and 
cannabigerol monomethyl ether (in some Asian strains). The biosynthetic 
pathways of the cannabinoids are not yet satisfactorily elucidated, although 
the scheme shown in Fig. 10 is commonly accepted. At least in some strains, THC 
is derived from cannabigerol, while in others it may be derived from CBD. CBN 
and&nbsp;D8-THC are considered to be degradation products or analytical 
artifacts (Pate 1998a).</p> <br>
<strong>Fig. 8.</strong>&nbsp;Scanning 
electron micrographs of the abaxial surface of a perigonal bract (which 
envelops the fruit). These bracts are the most intoxicating part of the plant, 
and may contain 20% THC, dry weight. The resin is synthesized both in stalked 
and sessile glands. Multicellular secretory glands (of phallic appearance), 
some broken stalks of these (note cellular appearance), and unicellular 
cystolith hairs (claw-like structures) are pictured. <strong>Fig. 9.</strong>
&nbsp;Some important cannabinoids of cannabis resin.&nbsp;D9-THC (delta-9 
tetrahydrocannabinol) is the chief intoxicant chemical and predominates in 
intoxicant strains, while the isomer&nbsp;D8-THC is usually present in no more 
than trace amounts. CBD (cannabidiol) is the chief non-intoxicant chemical, and 
predominates in non-intoxicant strains; it has sedative effects. The 
non-intoxicant CBN (cannabinol) is a frequent degradation or oxidation product. 
The non-intoxicant cannabichromene (CBC) is typically found in trace amounts in 
intoxicant strains. The non-intoxicant cannabigerol (CBG) is considered to be a 
precursor of the other cannbinoids (see Fig. 10). <br>

principal cannabinoids (after Pate 1998b).</p> 
<p>Both in Canada and the US, the most critical problem to be addressed for 
commercial exploitation of&nbsp;<em>C. sativa</em>&nbsp;is the possible 
unauthorized drug use of the plant. Indeed, the reason hemp cultivation was 
made illegal in North America was concern that the hemp crop was a drug menace. 
The drug potential is, for practical purposes, measured by the presence of THC. 
THC is the world&rsquo;s most popular illicit chemical, and indeed the fourth 
most popular recreational drug, after caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine. 
&ldquo;Industrial hemp&rdquo; is a phrase that has become common to designate 
hemp used for commercial non-intoxicant purposes. Small and Cronquist (1976) 
split<em>C. sativa&nbsp;</em>into two subspecies:&nbsp;<em>C. sativa</em>
&nbsp;subsp.&nbsp;<em>sativa</em>, with less than 0.3% (dry weight) of THC in 
the upper (reproductive) part of the plant, and&nbsp;<em>C. sativa</em>
&nbsp;subsp.&nbsp;<em>indica</em>&nbsp;(Lam.) E. Small &amp; Cronq. with more 
than 0.3% THC. This classification has since been adopted in the European 
Community, Canada, and parts of Australia as a dividing line between cultivars 
that can be legally cultivated under license and forms that are considered to 
have too high a drug potential. For a period, 0.3% was also the allowable THC 
content limit for cultivation of hemp in the Soviet Union. In the US, Drug 
Enforcement Agency guidelines issued Dec. 7, 1999 expressly allowed products 
with a THC content of less than 0.3% to enter the US without a license; but 
subsequently permissible levels have been a source of continuing contention. 
Marijuana in the illicit market typically has a THC content of 5% to 10% 
(levels as high as 25% have been reported), and as a point of interest, a 
current Canadian government experimental medicinal marijuana production 
contract calls for the production of 6% marijuana. As noted above, a level of 
about 1% THC is considered the threshold for marijuana to have intoxicating 
potential, so the 0.3% level is conservative, and some countries (e.g. parts of 
Australia, Switzerland) have permitted the cultivation of cultivars with higher 
levels. It should be appreciated that there is considerable variation in THC 
content in different parts of the plant. THC content increases in the following 
order: achenes (excluding bracts), roots, large stems, smaller stems, older and 
larger leaves, younger and smaller leaves, flowers, perigonal bracts covering 
both the female flowers and fruits. It is well known in the illicit trade how 
to screen off the more potent fractions of the plant in order to increase THC 
levels in resultant drug products. Nevertheless, a level of 0.3% THC in the 
flowering parts of the plant is reflective of material that is too low in 
intoxicant potential to actually be used practically for illicit production of 
marijuana or other types of cannabis drugs. Below, the problem of permissible 
levels of THC in food products made from hempseed is discussed.</p> 
<p>There is a general inverse relationship in the resin of&nbsp;<em>Cannabis
</em>&nbsp;between the amounts of THC present and the amount of the other 
principal cannabinoid, CBD. Whereas most drug strains contain primarily THC and 
little or no CBD, fiber and oilseed strains primarily contain CBD and very 
little THC. CBD can be converted to THC by acid catalyzed cyclization, and so 
could serve as a starting material for manufacturing THC. In theory, therefore, 
low-THC cultivars do not completely solve the problem of drug abuse potential. 
In practice, however, the illicit drug trade has access to easier methods of 
synthesizing THC or its analogues than by first extracting CBD from non-drug 
hemp strains.</p> 
<p>Breeding for low THC cultivars in Europe has been reviewed by B&oacute;csa 
(1998), B&oacute;csa and Karus (1998), and Virovets (1996). Some researchers 
have claimed to have produced essentially THC-free strains, although at present 
no commercial cultivar seems to be 100% free of THC. THC content has proven to 
be more easily reduced in monoecious than in dioecious varieties. It should be 
possible to select THC-free strains, and there has been speculation that 
genetic engineering could be helpful in this regard. As a strategic economic 
and political tactic, France has been attempting for several years to have the 
European Union (EU) adopt legislation forbidding the cultivation of industrial 
hemp cultivars with more than 0.1% THC, which would mean that primarily French 
varieties would have to be cultivated in Europe. However, the Canadian 
government has found that some French material has proven to be excessively 
high in THC.</p> 
<p>There is certainly a need to utilize available germplasm sources in order 
to breed suitable cultivars for North America. A list of the 24 approved 
cultivars for the 2001 season in Canada is at 
www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hpb-dgps/therapeut/htmleng/hemp.html. Most of these are 
regulated by the European Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD). These cultivars are &ldquo;approved&rdquo; for use in Canada not on 
agricultural criteria, but merely on the basis that they meet the THC 
criterion. Indeed, most of these are unsuitable or only marginally suitable for 
Canada (Small and Marcus 2000), and only a very few Canadian cultivars to date 
have been created. In Canada, every acquisition of hemp grown at a particular 
place and time must be tested for THC content by an independent laboratory and, 
under the industrial hemp regulations, fields of hemp with more than 0.3% THC 
may require destruction (a slight degree of flexibility is generally 
exercised). Importation of experimental hemp lines (i.e. other than the 
approved cultivars) requires importation licenses (as well as phytosanitary 
clearance of the shipment by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency), and the 
importation licenses require an indication that the THC contents are low.</p> 
<p>In Canada, the methodology used for analyses and sample collection for THC 
analysis of hemp plantings is standardized (at the Health Canada/Therapeutics 
Program/Hemp web site at www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hpb-dgps/therapeut/htmleng/hemp.html, 
see &ldquo;Industrial Hemp Technical Manual&rdquo; for procedures on sampling 
plant materials and chemical procedures for determining THC levels). The 
regulations require that one of the dozen independent laboratories licensed for 
the purpose conduct the analyses and report the results to Health Canada. 
Sample collection is also normally carried out by an independent authorized 
firm. The Canadian system of monitoring THC content has rigidly limited hemp 
cultivation to cultivars that consistently develop THC levels below 0.3%.</p> 
<p>Because&nbsp;<em>C. sativa</em>&nbsp;has been a neglected crop for so long 
in North America, there are only negligible genetic resources available on this 
continent. Most germplasm stocks of hemp are in Europe, and the largest and 
most important collection is the Vavilov Institute gene bank in Leningrad. 
Figure 11 shows THC concentrations in the Vavilov collection, as well as in our 
own collection, largely of European germplasm. A disturbingly high percentage 
of the collections have THC levels higher than 0.3%, making it difficult to 
incorporate these into breeding programs.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Fig. 11.</strong>&nbsp;Frequency histograms of THC concentration in 
germplasm collections. Left, collection of E. Small and D. Marcus; of the 167 
accessions, 43% had THC levels &gt;0.3%. Right, the collection of the Vavilov 
Institute, St. Petersburg; of the 278 accessions for which chemical analyses 
were reported in Anonymous (1975), about 55% had THC levels &gt;0.3%.</p> 
<p>Soil characteristics, latitude and climatic stresses have been found to 
have significant effects on THC concentrations, and there are seasonal and even 
diurnal variations (Small 1979; Pate 1998b). However, the range of THC 
concentrations developed by low-THC cultivars (those typically with &pound;0.3% 
THC) under different circumstances on the whole is limited, for the most part 
generally not varying more than 0.2 percentage points when grown in a range of 
circumstances, and usually less (note information in Scheifle et al. 1999; 
Scheifle 2000, Scheifle and Dragla 2000). Practically, this has meant in 
Canadian experience that a few cultivars have been eliminated from further 
commercial cultivation because they sometimes exceed the 0.3% level 
(&lsquo;Fedora 19&rsquo; and &lsquo;Futura,&rsquo; authorized in 2000, have now 
been removed because some test results in several years exceeded 0.3%; 
&lsquo;Finola&rsquo; and &lsquo;Uniko B&rsquo; are under probation because of 
elevated levels), but on the whole most of the permitted cultivars have 
maintained highly consistent development of quite low levels of THC.</p> 
<p>Hemp seeds contain virtually no THC, but THC contamination results from 
contact of the seeds with the resin secreted by the epidermal glands on the 
leaves and floral parts, and also by the failure to sift away all of the bracts 
(which have the highest concentration of THC of any parts of the plant) that 
cover the seeds. This results in small levels of THC appearing in hempseed oil 
and foods made with the seeds. Although most of the western hemp-growing world 
uses 0.3% THC as a maximum concentration for authorized cultivation of hemp 
plants, regulations in various countries allow only a much lower level of THC 
in human food products manufactured from the seeds. Currently, up to 10 ppm THC 
is permitted in seeds and oil products used for food purposes in Canada. In 
Germany, more stringent limits were set for food in 2000: 5 ppm in food oil, 
0.005 ppm in beverages, and 0.15 ppm in all other foods. The US Drug 
Enforcement Administration published new regulations on hemp in the Federal 
Register on October 9th 2001 that in effect 4 months later would ban the food 
use of hemp in the US because any amount of THC would be unacceptable in foods 
(follow links at www.hempreport.com/). These proposals are currently being 
challenged by the hemp industry. Limits have been set because of concerns about 
possible toxicity and interference with drug tests (Grotenhermen et al. 1998). 
An extensive analysis of literature dealing with the toxicity of hemp is in Orr 
and Starodub (1999; see Geiwitz 2001 for an analysis). Because hemp food 
products are considered to have great economic potential, there is considerable 
pressure on the hemp industry in North America to reduce THC levels.</p> 
<p>The Drug Enforcement Agency and the Office of National Drug Control Policy 
of the US raised concerns over tests conducted from 1995 to 1997 that showed 
that consumption of hempseed products available during that period led to 
interference with drug-testing programs for marijuana use. Federal US programs 
utilize a THC metabolite level of 50 parts per billion in urine. Leson (2000) 
found that this level was not exceeded by consuming hemp products, provided 
that THC levels are maintained below 5 ppm in hemp oil, and below 2 ppm in 
hulled seeds. Nevertheless the presence of even minute trace amounts of THC in 
foods remains a tool that can be used by those wishing to prevent the hemp 
oilseed industry from developing.</p> 
<h2>FIBER USES</h2> 
<p>Based on world production of fibers in 1999, about 54.5% was synthetic (of 
which 60.3% was polyester), 42.9% was plant fiber (of which 78.5% was cotton), 
and 2.6% was wool (Karus 2000). In addition to cotton, flax is the only other 
significant plant fiber crop grown in temperate regions of the world (kenaf has 
received some enthusiastic backing in the southern US in recent years, but is 
most cheaply produced in India, Bangladesh, and China). Flax held 2.7% of the 
world plant fiber market in 1999, while hemp had only 0.3% (Karus 2000). Hemp 
fiber can potentially replace other biological fibers in many applications, but 
also, as noted below, can sometimes compete with minerals such as glass fiber 
and steel. As forests diminish, cultivation of annual plants as fiber sources 
is likely to increase. While crop residues like cereal straw will probably 
supply much of the need, specialty fiber plants such as hemp also have 
potential. The four conditions that will need to be met are (after Bolton 
1995): (1) the material should be produced at a large enough scale; (2) the 
price should be low enough; (3) the fiber characteristics should be adequate 
for the end use; and (4) proven technology should be available for the 
processing of the new raw material. Of these criteria only point 3 is 
adequately met at this time for hemp in North America, but this is to be 
expected in a crop that has only begun to be cultivated after an absence of 
many years.</p> 
<p>One of the reasons hemp fiber has been valued is because of its length. The 
primary bast fibers in the bark are 5&ndash;40 mm long, and are amalgamated in 
fiber bundles which can be 1&ndash;5 m long (secondary bast fibers are about 2 
mm long). The woody core fibers are short&mdash;about 0.55 mm&mdash;and like 
hardwood fibers are cemented together with considerable lignin. The core fibers 
are generally considered too short for high grade paper applications (a length 
of 3 mm is considered ideal), and too much lignin is present. While the long 
bast fibers have been used to make paper almost for 2 millennia, the woody core 
fibers have rarely been so used. Nevertheless it has been suggested that the 
core fibers could be used for paper making, providing appropriate technology 
was developed (de Groot et al. 1998). In any event, the core fibers, have found 
a variety of uses, as detailed below. The long, lignin-poor bast fibers also 
have considerable potential to be used in many non-paper, non-textile 
applications, as noted below.</p> 
<p>Selection for fiber has resulted in strains that have much more bark fiber 
tissues and much less woody core than encountered in narcotic strains, oilseed 
strains, and wild plants (Fig. 12). In non-fiber strains of&nbsp;<em>Cannabis
</em>, bark can be less than one quarter of the stem tissues (i.e. more than 
three quarters can be woody core). By contrast, in fiber strains half of the 
stem tissues can be bark, and more than half of this can be the desirable long 
primary fibers (de Meijer 1995). Non-fiber strains rarely have as much as 15% 
fiber in the bark.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Fig. 12.&nbsp;</strong>Cross sections of stems at internodes of a 
fiber plant (left) and of a narcotic plant (right). Fiber cultivars have stems 
that are more hollow at the internodes, i.e. less wood, since this allows more 
energy to be directed into the production of bark fiber.</p> 
<p>Other desirable features of hemp fibers are strength and durability 
(particularly resistance to decay), which made hemp useful in the past for 
rope, nets, sail-cloth, and oakum for caulking. During the age of sailing ships,
<em>Cannabis</em>&nbsp;was considered to provide the very best of canvas, and 
indeed this word is derived from&nbsp;<em>Cannabis</em>. Several factors 
combined to decrease the popularity of hemp in the late 19th and early 20th 
centuries. Increasing limitation of cheap labor for traditional production in 
Europe and the New World led to the creation of some mechanical inventions, but 
too late to counter growing interest in competitive crops. Development of other 
natural fibers as well as synthetic fibers increased competition for 
hemp&rsquo;s uses as a textile fiber and for cordage. Hemp rag had been much 
used for paper, but the 19th century introduction of the chemical woodpulping 
process considerably lowered demand for hemp. The demise of the sail diminished 
the market for canvas. Increasing use of the plant for drugs gave hemp a bad 
image. All this led to the discontinuation of hemp cultivation in the early and 
middle parts of the 20th century in much of the world where cheap labor was 
limited. In the 19th century softer fabrics took over the clothing market, and 
today, hemp constitutes only about 1% of the natural fiber market. At least 
some production of hemp for fiber still occurs in Russia, China, the Ukraine, 
Poland, Hungary, the countries of the former Yugoslavia, Romania, Korea, Chile, 
and Peru. There has been renewed interest in England, Australia, and South 
Africa in cultivating fiber hemp. Italy has an outstanding reputation for 
high-quality hemp, but productivity has waned for the last several decades. In 
France, a market for high-quality paper, ironically largely cigarette paper, 
has developed (such paper is completely free of the intoxicating resin). Modern 
plant breeding in Europe has produced several dozen hemp strains, although by 
comparison with other fiber crops there are relatively few described varieties 
of hemp. Since World War II, breeding has been concerned most particularly with 
the development of monoecious varieties. Gehl (1995) reviewed fiber hemp 
development in Canada in the early 20th century, and concluded that the 
prospects for a traditional fiber industry were poor. However, as outlined 
below, there are now many non-traditional usages for hemp fiber which require 
consideration. Hemp long fiber is one of the strongest and most durable of 
natural fibers, with high tensile strength, wet strength, and other 
characteristics that make it technically suited for various industrial products 
(Karus and Leson 1996).</p> 
<p>From 1982 to 2002 the EU provided the equivalent of about 50 million 
dollars to develop new flax and hemp harvesting and fiber processing 
technologies (Karus et al. 2000). Because of the similarities of flax and hemp, 
the technologies developed for one usually are adaptable to the other. In 
addition, various European nations and private firms contributed to the 
development of hemp technologies. Accordingly, Europe is far more advanced in 
hemp development with respect to all fiber-based applications than other parts 
of the world. The EU currently dedicates about 30,000 ha to hemp production. 
France is the leading country in hemp cultivation in the EU, and 95% of the 
non-seed production is used for &ldquo;specialty pulp&rdquo; as described 
below. Harvesting and processing machinery for fiber hemp is highly advanced in 
Europe, and some has been imported into Canada. However, there is insufficient 
fiber processing capacity to handle hemp produced in Canada.</p> 
<h3>Textiles</h3> 
<p>Hemp is a bast fiber crop, i.e. the most desirable (&ldquo;long&rdquo;) 
fibers are found in the phloem-associated tissues external to the phloem, just 
under the &ldquo;bark.&rdquo; The traditional and still major first step in 
fiber extraction is to ret (&ldquo;rot&rdquo;) away the softer parts of the 
plant, by exposing the cut stems to microbial decay in the field (&ldquo;dew 
retting,&rdquo; shown in Figs. 46 and 47) or submerged in water (&ldquo;water 
retting, &rdquo; shown in Fig. 13). The result is to slough off the outer parts 
of the stem and to loosen the inner woody core (the &ldquo;hurds&rdquo;) from 
the phloem fibers (Fig. 14). Water retting has been largely abandoned in 
countries where labor is expensive or environmental regulations exist. Water 
retting, typically by soaking the stalks in ditches, can lead to a high level 
of pollution. Most hemp fiber used in textiles today is water retted in China 
and Hungary. Retting in tanks rather than in open bodies of water is a way of 
controlling the effluents while taking advantage of the high-quality fiber that 
is produced. Unlike flax, hemp long fiber requires water retting for 
preparation of high-quality spinnable fibers for production of fine textiles. 
Improved microorganisms or enzymes could augment or replace traditional water 
retting. Steam explosion is another potential technology that has been 
experimentally applied to hemp (Garcia-Jaldon et al. 1998). Decorticated 
material (i.e. separated at least into crude fiber) is the raw material, and 
this is subjected to steam under pressure and increased temperature which 
&ldquo;explodes&rdquo; (separates) the fibers so that one has a more refined 
(thinner) hemp fiber that currently is only available from water retting. Even 
when one has suitably separated long fiber, specialized harvesting, processing, 
spinning and weaving equipment are required for preparing fine hemp textiles. 
The refinement of equipment and new technologies are viewed as offering the 
possibility of making fine textile production practical in western Europe and 
North America, but at present China controls this market, and probably will 
remain dominant for the foreseeable future.</p> <br>

Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops, Novi Sad.) <strong>Fig. 14.&nbsp;
</strong>Fiber in retted hemp stem. This stem was bent sharply after retting, 
breaking the woody central portion (hurds), leaving the bark fibers unbroken. 
The two portions of stem are separated in this photograph, and are joined by 
the tough bark fibers. <br>
<br>

<p>There are practical, if cruder alternatives to separate the long fiber for 
high-quality textile production, but in fact such techniques are used mostly 
for non-textile applications. This involves production of &ldquo;whole 
fibers&rdquo; (i.e. harvesting both the long fibers from the cortex and the 
shorter fibers from throughout the stem), and technologies that utilize 
shortened hemp fibers. This approach is currently dominant in western Europe 
and Canada, and commences with field dew retting (typically 2&ndash;3 weeks). A 
principal limitation is climatic&mdash;the local environment should be suitably 
but not excessively moist at the close of the harvest season. Once stalks are 
retted, dried, and baled, they are processed to extract the fiber. In 
traditional hemp processing, the long fiber was separated from the internal 
woody hurds in two steps, breaking (stalks were crushed under rollers that 
broke the woody core into short pieces, some of which were separated) and 
scutching (the remaining hurds, short fibers (&ldquo;tow&rdquo;) and long 
fibers (&ldquo;line fiber, &rdquo; &ldquo;long-line fiber&rdquo;) were 
separated). A single, relatively expensive machine called a decorticator can do 
these two steps as one. In general in the EU and Canada, fibers are not 
separated into tow and line fibers, but are left as &ldquo;whole fiber.&rdquo; 
In western Europe, the fiber is often &ldquo;cottonized,&rdquo; i.e. chopped 
into short segments the size of cotton and flax fiber, so that the fibers can 
be processed on flax processing machinery, which is very much better developed 
than such machinery is for hemp. In North America the use of hemp for 
production of even crude textiles is marginal. Accordingly, the chief current 
fiber usages of North American, indeed of European hemp, are non-textile.</p> 
<p>Although always sold at a premium price, hemp clothing has a natural appeal 
to a sector of the population. Hemp clothes are resistant to abrasion, but are 
typically abrasive. However, appropriate processing and blending with other 
natural fibers has significantly improved the &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of the 
product, and in China hemp textiles indistinguishable from fine linens in 
texture are available. Weaving of hemp fibers into textiles and apparel is 
primarily done in China, Hungary, Romania, Russia, and the Ukraine. Processing 
costs are higher for industrial hemp because the fibers vary from the standard 
specifications for fiber length and diameter established for the equipment used 
in most textile and apparel factories, necessitating the use of specialty 
machines. The North American hemp apparel industry today is based on fiber, 
yarn, and fabrics imported from Eastern Europe and China. The extraction 
technology and spinning facilities, to say nothing of much lower labor costs, 
make it very difficult for the potential development of a hemp textile industry 
in North America. The fact that spinning facilities for natural fibers are so 
concentrated in China is making it increasingly difficult to competitively 
produce hemp fabrics elsewhere. This of course lessens the value-added future 
of growing hemp for a potential textile industry in North America. It is 
possible, however, that new technologies could change this situation, and 
especially in the EU development is underway to establish a fledgling domestic 
hemp textile industry. In addition to textiles used in clothing, coarser woven 
cloth (canvas) is used for upholstery, bags, sacks, and tarpaulins. There is 
very little effort in North America to produce such woven products, and 
non-woven material (Fig. 15) can be more easily produced. Hempline in Ontario, 
the first firm to grow hemp for commercial purposes in North America since the 
second word war (starting with experimental cultivation in 1994), is the 
exception, and is concerned with production of fiber for upholstery and 
carpeting.</p>

<h3>Pulp and Paper</h3> 
<p>Van Roekel (1994) has pointed out that Egyptian papyrus sheets are not 
&ldquo;paper,&rdquo; because the fiber strands are woven, not 
&ldquo;wet-laid;&rdquo; the oldest surviving paper is over 2,000 years of age, 
from China, and was made from hemp fiber (Fleming and Clarke 1998). Until the 
early 19th century, hemp, and flax were the chief paper-making materials. In 
historical times, hemp rag was processed into paper. Using hemp directly for 
paper was considered too expensive, and in any event the demand for paper was 
far more limited than today. Wood-based paper came into use when mechanical and 
chemical pulping was developed in the mid 1800s in Germany and England. Today, 
at least 95% of paper is made from wood pulp.</p> 
<p>The pulp and paper industry based on wood has considered the use of hemp 
for pulp, but only on an experimental basis. Hemp&rsquo;s long fibers could 
make paper more recyclable. Since virgin pulp is required for added strength in 
the recycling of paper, hemp pulp would allow for at least twice as many cycles 
as wood pulp. However, various analyses have concluded that the use of hemp for 
conventional paper pulp is not profitable (Fertig 1996).</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Specialty pulp&rdquo; is the most important component of the hemp 
industry of the EU, and is expected to remain its core market for the 
foreseeable future. The most important specialty pulp products made from hemp 
are cigarette paper (Fig. 16), bank notes, technical filters, and hygiene 
products. Other uses include art papers and tea bags. Several of these 
applications take advantage of hemp&rsquo;s high tear and wet strength. This is 
considered to be a highly stable, high-priced niche market in Europe, where 
hemp has an 87% market share of the &ldquo;specialty pulp&rdquo; sector (Karus 
et al. 2000). In Europe, decortication/refining machines are available that can 
produce 10 t/hour of hemp fiber suitable for such pulp use. North American 
capacity for hemp pulp production and value-added processing is much more 
limited than that of Europe, and this industry is negligible in North America.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Fig. 16.&nbsp;</strong>Hemp cigarette paper, the most profitable 
paper product currently manufactured from hemp.</p> 
<p>Hemp paper is useful for specialty applications such as currency and 
cigarette papers where strength is needed. The bast fiber is of greatest 
interest to the pulp and paper industry because of its superior strength 
properties compared to wood. However, the short, bulky fibers found in the 
inner part of the plant (hurds) can also be used to make cheaper grades of 
paper, apparently without greatly affecting quality of the printing surface. 
Hemp is not competitive for newsprint, books, writing papers, and general paper 
(grocery bags, coffee cups, napkins), although there is a specialty or novelty 
market for those specifically wishing to support the hemp industry by 
purchasing hemp writing or printing paper despite the premium price (Fig. 17).
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Fig. 17.</strong>&nbsp;Hemp paper products (writing paper, 
notebook, envelopes).</p> 
<p>A chief argument that has been advanced in favor of developing hemp as a 
paper and pulp source has been that as a non-wood or tree-free fiber source, it 
can reduce harvesting of primary forests and the threat to associated 
biodiversity. It has been claimed that hemp produces three to four times as 
much useable fiber per hectare per annum as forests. However, Wong (1998) notes 
evidence that in the southern US hemp would produce only twice as much pulp as 
does a pine plantation (but see discussion below on suitability of hemp as a 
potential lumber substitute in areas lacking trees).</p> 
<p>Hemp paper is high-priced for several reasons. Economies of scale are such 
that the supply of hemp is minute compared to the supply of wood fiber. Hemp 
processing requires non-wood-based processing facilities. Hemp paper is 
typically made only from bast fibers, which require separation from the hurds, 
thereby increasing costs. This represents less than 50% of the possible fiber 
yield of the plant, and future technologies that pulp the whole stalks could 
decrease costs substantially. Hemp is harvested once a year, so that it needs 
to be stored to feed mills throughout the year. Hemp stalks are very bulky, 
requiring much handling and storage. Transportation costs are also very much 
higher for hemp stalks than for wood chips. Waste straw is widely available 
from cereals and other crops, and although generally not nearly as desirable as 
hemp, can produce bulk pulp far more cheaply than can be made from hemp. In 
addition to agricultural wastes, there are vast quantities of scrub trees, 
especially poplar, in northern areas, that can supply large amounts of 
low-quality wood fiber extremely cheaply. Moreover, in northern areas 
fast-growing poplars and willows can be grown, and such agro-forestry can be 
very productive and environmentally benign. And, directly or indirectly, the 
lumber/paper industry receives subsidies and/or supports, which is most 
unlikely for hemp.</p> 
<h3>Plastic Composites for the Automobile and Other Manufacturing Sectors</h3> 
<p>With respect to fiber, a &ldquo;composite&rdquo; is often defined as a 
material consisting of 30%&ndash;70% fiber and 70%&ndash;30% matrix (Bolton 
1995). However, in North America particleboards and fiberboards, which 
generally contain less than 10% adhesive or matrix, are sometimes referred to 
as composites. This section addresses plastic-type composites. In plastics, 
fibers are introduced to improve physical properties such as stiffness, impact 
resistance, bending and tensile strength. Man-made fibers of glass, kevlar and 
carbon are most commonly used today, but plant fibers offer considerable cost 
savings along with comparable strength properties.</p> 
<p>Plastic composites for automobiles are the second most important component 
of the hemp industry of the EU. Natural fibers in automobile composites are 
used primarily in press-molded parts (Fig. 18). There are two widespread 
technologies. In thermoplastic production, natural fibers are blended with 
polypropylene fibers and formed into a mat, which is pressed under heat into 
the desired form. In thermoset production the natural fibers are soaked with 
binders such as epoxy resin or polyurethane, placed in the desired form, and 
allowed to harden through polymerization. Hemp has also been used in other 
types of thermoplastic applications, including injection molding. The 
characteristics of hemp fibers have proven to be superior for production of 
molded composites. In European manufacturing of cars, natural fibers are used 
to reinforce door panels, passenger rear decks, trunk linings, and pillars. In 
1999 over 20,000 t of natural fiber were used for these purposes in Europe, 
including about, 2,000 t of hemp. It has been estimated that 5&ndash;10 kg of 
natural fibers can be used in the molded portions of an average automobile 
(excluding upholstery). The demand for automobile applications of hemp is 
expected to increase considerably, depending on the development of new 
technologies (Karus et al. 2000).</p>

than 30 parts made of natural fibers, including hemp. (Courtesy of T. 
Schloesser, Daimler-Chrysler.)</p> 
<p>Henry Ford recognized the utility of hemp in early times. In advance of 
today&rsquo;s automobile manufacturers, he constructed a car with certain 
components made of resin stiffened with hemp fiber (Fig. 19). Rather ironically 
in view of today&rsquo;s parallel situation, Henry Ford&rsquo;s hemp 
innovations in the 1920s occurred at a time of crisis for American farms, later 
to intensify with the depression. The need to produce new industrial markets 
for farm products led to a broad movement for scientific research in 
agriculture that came to be labeled &ldquo;Farm Chemurgy,&rdquo; that today is 
embodied in chemical applications of crop constituents.</p>

hemp. (From the collections of Henry Ford Museum &amp; Greenfield Village.)</p> 
<p>There is also considerable potential for other industries using hemp in the 
manner that the automobile industry has demonstrated is feasible. Of course, 
all other types of transportation vehicles from bicycles to airplanes might 
make use of such technology. Natural fibers have considerable advantages for 
use in conveyance (Karus et al. 2000): low density and weight reduction, 
favorable mechanical, acoustical, and processing properties (including low wear 
on tools), no splintering in accidents, occupational health benefits (compared 
to glass fibers), no off-gassing of toxic compounds, and price advantages. 
Additional types of composite using hemp in combination with other natural 
fibers, post-industrial plastics or other types of resins, are being used to 
produce non-woven matting for padding, sound insulation, and other applications.

<h3>Building Construction Products</h3> 
<p><em>Thermal Insulation.</em>&nbsp;Thermal insulation products (Fig. 20, 21) 
are the third most important sector of the hemp industry of the EU. These are 
in very high demand because of the alarmingly high costs of heating fuels, 
ecological concerns about conservation of non-renewable resources, and 
political-strategic concerns about dependence on current sources of oil. This 
is a market that is growing very fast, and hemp insulation products are 
increasing in popularity. In Europe, it has been predicted that tens of 
thousands of tonnes will be sold by 2005, shared between hemp and flax (Karus 
et al. 2000).</p> <br>

<br>

<p>Fiberboard. In North America the use of nonwood fibers in sheet fiberboard 
(&ldquo;pressboard&rdquo; or &ldquo;composite board&rdquo;) products is 
relatively undeveloped. Flax, jute, kenaf, hemp, and wheat straw can be used to 
make composite board. Wheat straw is the dominant nonwood fiber in such 
applications. Although it might seem that hemp bast fibers are desirable in 
composite wood products because of their length and strength, in fact the short 
fibers of the hurds have been found to produce a superior product (K. Domier, 
pers. commun.). Experimental production of hemp fiberboard has produced 
extremely strong material (Fig. 22). The economic viability of such remains to 
be tested. Molded fiberboard products are commercially viable in Europe (Fig. 
23), but their potential in North America remains to be determined.</p> <br>

Netherlands). <br>
<br>

<p><em>Cement (Concrete) and Plaster.&nbsp;</em>Utilizing the ancient 
technique of reinforcing clay with straw to produce reinforced bricks for 
constructing domiciles, plant fibers have found a number of comparable uses in 
modern times. Hemp fibers added to concrete increase tensile strength while 
reducing shrinkage and cracking. Whole houses have been made based on hemp 
fiber (Fig. 24, 25). In North America, such usage has only reached the level of 
a cottage industry. Fiber-reinforced cement boards and fiber-reinforced plaster 
are other occasionally produced experimental products. Hemp fibers are produced 
at much more cost than wood chips and straw from many other crops, so high-end 
applications requiring high strength seem most appropriate.</p> <br>

<br>

<p>The above uses are based on hemp as a mechanical strengthener of materials. 
Hemp can also be chemically combined with materials. For example, hemp with 
gypsum and binding agents may produce light panels that might compete with 
drywall. Hemp and lime mixtures make a high quality plaster. Hemp hurds are 
rich in silica (which occurs naturally in sand and flint), and the hurds mixed 
with lime undergo mineralization, to produce a stone-like material. The 
technology is most advanced in France (Fig. 26). The mineralized material can 
be blown or poured into the cavities of walls and in attics as insulation. The 
foundations, walls, floors, and ceilings of houses have been made using hemp 
hurds mixed with natural lime and water. Sometimes plaster of Paris (pure 
gypsum), cement, or sand is added. The resulting material can be poured like 
concrete, but has a texture vaguely reminiscent of cork&mdash;much lighter than 
cement, and with better heat and sound-insulating properties. An experimental 
&ldquo;ceramic tile&rdquo; made of hemp has recently been produced (Fig. 27).

<br> 
<h3>Animal Bedding</h3> 
<p>The woody core (hurds, sometimes called shives) of hemp makes remarkably 
good animal bedding (Fig. 28, 29). The hurds are sometimes molded into small 
pellets for bedding applications (Fig. 30). Such appears to be unsurpassed for 
horse bedding, and also make an excellent litter for cats and other pets (Fig. 
31). The hurds can absorb up to five times their weight in moisture (typically 
50% higher than wood shavings), do not produce dust (following initial dust 
removal), and are easily composted. Hemp bedding is especially suited to horses 
allergic to straw. In Europe, the animal bedding market is not considered 
important (Karus et al. 2000), but in North America there are insufficient hemp 
hurds available to meet market demand.</p> <br>

<br>

<p>The high absorbency of hemp hurds has led to their occasional use as an 
absorbent for oil and waste spill cleanup. Hemp as an industrial absorbent has 
generated some interest in Alberta, for use in land reclamation in the oil and 
gas industry. Because hemp hurds are a costly product, it is likely that animal 
bedding will remain the most important application.</p> 
<h3>Geotextiles</h3> 
<p>&ldquo;Geotextiles&rdquo; or &ldquo;agricultural textiles&rdquo; include 
(1) ground-retaining, biodegradable matting designed to prevent soil erosion, 
especially to stabilize new plantings while they develop root systems along 
steep highway banks to prevent soil slippage (Fig. 32); and (2) ground-covers 
designed to reduce weeds in planting beds (in the manner of plastic mulch). At 
present the main materials used are polymeric (polythene, spun-blown 
polypropylene) and some glass fiber and natural fibers. Both woven and 
non-woven fibers can be applied to geotextiles; woven and knitted materials are 
stronger and the open structure may be advantageous (e.g. in allowing plants to 
grow through), but non-wovens are cheaper and better at suppressing weeds. Flax 
and hemp fibers exposed to water and soil have been claimed to disintegrate 
rapidly over the course of a few months, which would make them unacceptable for 
products that need to have long-term stability when exposed to water and oil. 
Coco (coir) fiber has been said to be much more suitable, due to higher lignin 
content (40%&ndash;50%, compared to 2%&ndash;5% in bast fibers); these are much 
cheaper than flax and hemp fibers (Karus et al. 2000). However, this analysis 
does not do justice to the developing hemp geotextile market. Production of 
hemp erosion control mats is continuing in both Europe and Canada. Given the 
reputation for rot resistance of hemp canvas and rope, it seems probable that 
ground matting is a legitimate use. Moreover, the ability to last outdoors for 
many years is frequently undesirable in geotextiles. For example, the 
widespread current use of plastic netting to reinforce grass sod is quite 
objectionable, the plastic persisting for many years and interfering with lawn 
care. Related to geotextile applications is the possibility of using hemp fiber 
as a planting substrate (biodegradable pots and blocks for plants), and as 
biodegradable twine to replace plastic ties used to attach plants to supporting 
poles. Still another consideration is the &ldquo;green ideal&rdquo; of 
producing locally for local needs; by this credo, hemp is preferable in 
temperate regions to the use of tropical fibers, which need to be imported.</p>

</p> 
<h2>OILSEED USES</h2> 
<p>The cultivation of hemp in the EU is heavily weighted toward fiber 
production over oilseed production. In 1999, the EU produced about 27,000 t of 
hemp fiber, but only about 6,200 t of hemp seeds, mostly in France, and 90% of 
this was used as animal feed (Karus et al. 2000). The seeds (Fig. 33) have 
traditionally been employed as bird and poultry feed, but feeding the entire 
seeds to livestock has been considered to be a poor investment because of the 
high cost involved (although subsidization in Europe allows such usage, 
especially in France where hemp seeds are not legally permitted in human food). 
As pointed out later, higher yield and better harvesting practices may make 
whole hempseed an economical livestock feed. Moreover, seed cake left after 
expressing the oil is an excellent feed. Efforts are underway in Europe to add 
value in the form of processed products for hemp, especially cosmetics and food 
but, as noted below, the North American market is already quite advanced in 
oilseed applications.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Fig. 33.</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;Seeds&rdquo; (achenes) of hemp, with 
a match for scale.</p> 
<p>In the EU and Canada, hemp has often been grown as a dual-purpose crop, 
i.e. for both fiber and oilseed. In France, dual purpose hemp is typically 
harvested twice&mdash;initially the upper seed-bearing part of the stems is cut 
and threshed with a combine, and subsequently the remaining stems are 
harvested. Growing hemp to the stage that mature seeds are present compromises 
the quality of the fiber, because of lignification. As well, the hurds become 
more difficult to separate. The lower quality fiber, however, is quite 
utilizable for pulp and non-woven usages.</p> 
<p>In North America, oilseed hemp has several advantages over fiber hemp. Hemp 
seed and oil can fetch higher prices than hemp fiber. Hemp seed can be 
processed using existing equipment, while processing of hemp fiber usually 
requires new facilities and equipment.</p> 
<p>Canada is specialized on oilseed production and processing, so that hemp 
oil and grain are much more suitable than fiber. Because of the extensive 
development of oilseeds in Canada, there is extensive capacity to produce 
high-quality cold-pressed hemp oil. Canada in the last 5 years has made great 
advances in the growing, harvesting, and processing of hempseed, and indeed has 
moved ahead of the EU in the development of raw materials and products for the 
natural foods, nutraceuticals, and cosmetics industries. In the EU, a yield of 
1 t/ha is considered good. In Canada, extraordinary yields of 1.5 t/ha have 
been realized, at least locally, although in the initial years of hempseed 
development in Canada yields were often less than 500 kg/ha. In 1999, the year 
of largest Canadian hemp acreage, yields averaged 900 kg/ha. (Ideally, hemp 
seed yield should be based on air dry weight&mdash;with about 12% moisture. 
Hemp yields are sometime uncertain, and could be exaggerated by as much as 50% 
when moist weights are reported.)</p> 
<p>Canadian experience with growing hemp commercially for the last 4 years has 
convinced many growers that it is better to use a single-purpose cultivar, seed 
or fiber, than a dual-purpose cultivar. The recent focus of Canadian hemp 
breeders has been to develop cultivars with high seed yields, low stature (to 
avoid channeling the plants&rsquo; energy into stalk, as is the case in fiber 
cultivars), early maturation (for the short growing seasons of Canada), and 
desirable fatty acid spectrum (especially gamma-linolenic acid).</p> 
<h3>Food</h3> 
<p>Dehulled (i.e. hulled) hemp seed is a very recent phenomenon, first 
produced in quantity in Europe. Hemp seeds have been used as food since ancient 
times, but generally the whole seed, including the hull, was eaten. Hemp seed 
was a grain used in ancient China, although there has been only minor direct 
use of hemp seed as food by humans. In the past, hemp seed has generally been a 
food of the lower classes, or a famine food. Peanut-butter type preparations 
have been produced from hemp seed in Europe for centuries, but were rather 
gritty since technology for removing the hulls was rudimentary. Modern seed 
dehulling using mechanical separation produces a smooth, white, gritless hemp 
seed meal that needs no additional treatment before it is consumed. It is 
important to understand, therefore, that the quality of modern hemp seed for 
human consumption far exceeds anything produced historically. This seed meal 
should be distinguished from the protein-rich, oil-poor seed cake remaining 
after oil has been expressed, that is used for livestock feed. The seed cake is 
also referred to as &ldquo;seed meal,&rdquo; and has proven to be excellent for 
animals (Mustafa et al. 1999).</p> 
<p>Hemp seeds have an attractive nutty taste, and are now incorporated into 
many food preparations (Fig. 34), often mimicking familiar foods. Those sold in 
North America include nutritional (granola-type) or snack bars, &ldquo;nut 
butters&rdquo; and other spreads, bread, pretzels, cookies, yogurts, pancakes, 
porridge, fruit crumble, frozen dessert (&ldquo;ice cream&rdquo;), pasta, 
burgers, pizza, salt substitute, salad dressings, mayonnaise, 
&ldquo;cheese,&rdquo; and beverages (&ldquo;milk,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;lemonade,&rdquo; &ldquo;beer,&rdquo; &ldquo;wine,&rdquo; &ldquo;coffee 
nog&rdquo;). Hemp seed is often found canned or vacuum-packed (Fig. 35). 
Alcoholic beverages made with hemp utilize hempseed as a flavorant. Hemp food 
products currently have a niche market, based particularly on natural food and 
specialty food outlets.</p> <br>

American food products made with hemp seed and/or hemp seed oil. <strong>Fig.

<br>

<h3>Edible Oil</h3> 
<p>The use of&nbsp;<em>Cannabis</em>&nbsp;for seed oil (Fig. 36) began at 
least 3 millennia ago. Hempseed oil is a drying oil, formerly used in paints 
and varnishes and in the manufacture of soap. Present cultivation of oilseed 
hemp is not competitive with linseed for production of oil for manufacturing, 
or to sunflower and canola for edible vegetable oil. However, as noted below, 
there are remarkable dietary advantages to hempseed oil, which accordingly has 
good potential for penetrating the salad oil market, and for use in a very wide 
variety of food products. There is also good potential for hemp oil in 
cosmetics and skin-care products.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Fig. 36.</strong>&nbsp;Hemp oil. (Courtesy of La Chanvri&egrave;re 
de l&rsquo;Aube, Bar sur Aube, France.)</p> 
<p>Foreign sources, China in particular, can produce hemp seed cheaply, but 
imported seed must be sterilized, and the delays this usually requires are 
detrimental. Seed that has been sterilized tends to go rancid quickly, and so 
it is imperative that fresh seed be available, a great advantage for domestic 
production. An additional extremely significant advantage that domestic 
producers have over foreign sources is organic production, which is important 
for the image desired by the hemp food market. Organic certification is much 
more reliable in North America than in the foreign countries that offer cheap 
seeds. Whereas China used to supply most of the hempseed used for food in North 
America, Canadian-grown seeds have taken over this market.</p> 
<p>About half of the world market for hemp oil is currently used for food and 
food supplements (de Guzman 2001). For edible purposes, hempseed oil is 
extracted by cold pressing. Quality is improved by using only the first 
pressing, and minimizing the number of green seeds present. The oil varies in 
color from off-yellow to dark green. The taste is pleasantly nutty, sometimes 
with a touch of bitterness. Hemp oil is high in unsaturated fatty acids (of the 
order of 75%), which can easily oxidize, so it is unsuitable for frying or 
baking. The high degree of unsaturation is responsible for the extreme 
sensitivity to oxidative rancidity. The oil has a relatively short shelf life. 
It should be extracted under nitrogen (to prevent oxidation), protected from 
light by being kept in dark bottles, and from heat by refrigeration. Addition 
of anti-oxidants prolongs the longevity of the oil. Steam sterilization of the 
seeds, often required by law, allows air to penetrate and so stimulates 
rancidity. Accordingly, sterilized or roasted hemp seeds, and products made 
from hemp seed that have been subjected to cooking, should be fresh. The value 
of hemp oil from the point of view of the primary components is discussed 
below. In addition, it has been suggested that other components, including 
trace amounts of terpenes and cannabinoids, could have health benefits (Leizer 
et al. 2000). According to an ancient legend (Abel 1980), Buddha, the founder 
of Buddhism, survived a 6-year interval of asceticism by eating nothing but one 
hemp seed daily. This apocryphal story holds a germ of truth&mdash;hemp seed is 
astonishingly nutritional.</p> 
<p><em>Fatty Acids.</em>&nbsp;The quality of an oil or fat is most importantly 
determined by its fatty acid composition. Hemp is of high nutritional quality 
because it contains high amounts of unsaturated fatty acids, mostly oleic acid 
(C18:1, 10%&ndash;16%), linoleic acid (C18:2, 50%&ndash;60%), alpha-linolenic 
acid (C18:3, 20%&ndash;25%), and gamma-linolenic acid (C18:3, 2%&ndash;5%) 
(Fig. 37). Linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid are the only two fatty acids 
that must be ingested and are considered essential to human health (Callaway 
1998). In contrast to shorter-chain and more saturated fatty acids, these 
essential fatty acids do not serve as energy sources, but as raw materials for 
cell structure and as precursors for biosynthesis for many of the body&rsquo;s 
regulatory biochemicals. The essential fatty acids are available in other oils, 
particularly fish and flaxseed, but these tend to have unpleasant flavors 
compared to the mellow, slightly nutty flavor of hempseed oil. While the value 
of unsaturated fats is generally appreciated, it is much less well known that 
the North American diet is serious nutritionally unbalanced by an excess of 
linoleic over alpha-linonenic acid. In hempseed, linoleic and alpha-linolenic 
occur in a ratio of about 3:1, considered optimal in healthy human adipose 
tissue, and apparently unique among common plant oils (Deferne and Pate 1996). 
Gamma-linolenic acid or GLA is another significant component of hemp oil 
(1%&ndash;6%, depending on cultivar). GLA is a widely consumed supplement known 
to affect vital metabolic roles in humans, ranging from control of inflammation 
and vascular tone to initiation of contractions during childbirth. GLA has been 
found to alleviate psoriasis, atopic eczema, and mastalgia, and may also 
benefit cardiovascular, psychiatric, and immunological disorders. Ageing and 
pathology (diabetes, hypertension, etc.) may impair GLA metabolism, making 
supplementation desirable. As much as 15% of the human population may benefit 
from addition of GLA to their diet. At present, GLA is available in health food 
shops and pharmacies primarily as soft gelatin capsules of borage or evening 
primrose oil, but hemp is almost certainly a much more economic source. 
Although the content of GLA in the seeds is lower, hemp is far easier to 
cultivate and higher-yielding. It is important to note that hemp is the only 
current natural food source of GLA, i.e. not requiring the consumption of 
extracted dietary supplements. There are other fatty acids in small 
concentrations in hemp seed that have some dietary significance, including 
stearidonic acid (Callaway et al. 1996) and eicosenoic acid (M&ouml;lleken and 
Theimer 1997). Because of the extremely desirable fatty acid constitution of 
hemp oil, it is now being marketed as a dietary supplement in capsule form 
(Fig. 38).</p> <br>
<strong>Fig. 37.</strong>&nbsp;Content of principal fatty 
acids in hempseed oil, based on means of 62 accessions grown in southern 
Ontario (reported in Small and Marcus 2000). <strong>Fig. 38.&nbsp;</strong>
Hemp oil in capsule form sold as a dietary supplement. <br>
<br>

<p><em>Tocopherols.</em>&nbsp;Tocopherols are major antioxidants in human 
serum. Alpha- beta-, gamma- and delta-tocopherol represent the vitamin E group. 
These fat-soluble vitamins are essential for human nutrition, especially the 
alpha-form, which is commonly called vitamin E. About 80% of the tocopherols of 
hempseed oil is the alpha form. The vitamin E content of hempseed is 
comparatively high. Antioxidants in hempseed oil are believed to stabilize the 
highly polyunsaturated oil, tending to keep it from going rancid. Sterols in 
the seeds probably serve the same function, and like the tocopherols are also 
desirable from a human health viewpoint.</p> 
<p><em>Protein.</em>&nbsp;Hemp seeds contain 25%&ndash;30% protein, with a 
reasonably complete amino acid spectrum. About two thirds of hempseed protein 
is edestin. All eight amino acids essential in the human diet are present, as 
well as others. Although the protein content is smaller than that of soybean, 
it is much higher than in grains like wheat, rye, maize, oat, and barley. As 
noted above, the oilcake remaining after oil is expressed from the seeds is a 
very nutritious feed supplement for livestock, but it can also be used for 
production of a high-protein flour.</p> 
<h3>Personal Care Products</h3> 
<p>In the 1990s, European firms introduced lines of hemp oil-based personal 
care products, including soaps, shampoos, bubble baths, and perfumes. Hemp oil 
is now marketed throughout the world in a range of body care products, 
including creams, lotions, moisturizers, and lip balms. In Germany, a laundry 
detergent manufactured entirely from hemp oil has been marketed. Hemp-based 
cosmetics and personal care products account for about half of the world market 
for hemp oil (de Guzman 2001).</p> 
<p>One of the most significant developments for the North American hemp 
industry was investment in hemp products by Anita and Gordon Roddick, founders 
of The Body Shop, a well known international chain of hair and body care 
retailers. This was a rather courageous and principled move that required 
overcoming American legal obstacles related to THC content. The Body Shop now 
markets an impressive array of hemp nutraceutical cosmetics (Fig. 39), and this 
has given the industry considerable credibility. The Body Shop has reported 
gross sales of about a billion dollars annually, and that about 4% of sales in 
2000 were hemp products.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Fig. 39.</strong>&nbsp;Body care products offered by the Body Shop.

<h3>Industrial Fluids</h3> 
<p>The vegetable oils have been classified by &ldquo;iodine value&rdquo; as 
drying (120&ndash;200), semi-drying (100&ndash;120), and non-drying 
(80&ndash;100), which is determined by the degree of saturation of the fatty 
acids present (Raie et al. 1995). Good coating materials prepared from 
vegetable oil depend on the nature and number of double bonds present in the 
fatty acids. Linseed oil, a drying oil, has a very high percentage of linolenic 
acid. Hempseed oil has been classified as a semi-drying oil, like soybean oil, 
and is therefore more suited to edible than industrial oil purposes. 
Nevertheless hemp oil has found applications in the past in paints, varnishes, 
sealants, lubricants for machinery, and printing inks. However, such industrial 
end uses are not presently feasible as the oil is considered too expensive (de 
Guzman 2001). Larger production volumes and lower prices may be possible, in 
which case hemp oil may find industrial uses similar to those of linseed 
(flax), soybean, and sunflower oils, which are presently used in paints, inks, 
solvents, binders, and in polymer plastics. Hemp shows a remarkable range of 
variation in oil constituents, and selection for oilseed cultivars with high 
content of valued industrial constituents is in progress.</p> 
<h2>MEDICINAL MARIJUANA</h2> 
<p>Marijuana has in fact been grown for medicinal research in North America by 
both the Canadian (Fig. 40) and American governments, and this will likely 
continue. The possibility of marijuana becoming a legal commercial crop in 
North America is, to say the least, unlikely in the foreseeable future. 
Nevertheless the private sector is currently producing medicinal marijuana in 
Europe and Canada, so the following orientation to marijuana as a potential 
authorized crop is not merely academic.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Fig. 40.&nbsp;</strong>A truckload of Canadian medicinal marijuana 
from a plantation in Ottawa in 1971. More than a ton of marijuana was prepared 
for experimental research (described in Small et al. 1975).</p> 
<p>The objectivity of scientific evaluation of the medicinal value of 
marijuana to date has been questioned. In the words of Hirst et al. (1998): 
&ldquo;<em>The &hellip;status of cannabis has made modern clinical research 
almost impossible. This is primarily because of the legal, ethical and 
bureaucratic difficulties in conducting trials with patients. Additionally, the 
general attitude towards cannabis, in which it is seen only as a drug of abuse 
and addiction, has not helped</em>.&rdquo; In a recent editorial, the respected 
journal Nature (2001) stated: &ldquo;<em>Governments, including the US federal 
government, have until recently refused to sanction the medical use of 
marijuana, and have also done what they can to prevent its clinical testing. 
They have defended their inaction by claiming that either step would signal to 
the public a softening of the so-called &lsquo;war on drugs.&rsquo;&hellip; The 
pharmacology of cannabinoids is a valid field of scientific investigation. 
Pharmacologists have the tools and the methodologies to realize its 
considerable potential, provided the political climate permits them to do so
</em>.&rdquo; Given these current demands for research on medicinal marijuana, 
it will be necessary to produce crops of drug types of&nbsp;<em>C. sativa</em>.
</p> 
<p>Earliest reference to euphoric use of&nbsp;<em>C. sativa</em>&nbsp;appears 
to date to China of 5 millennia ago, but it was in India over the last 
millennium that drug consumption became more firmly entrenched than anywhere 
else in the world. Not surprisingly, the most highly domesticated drug strains 
were selected in India. While&nbsp;<em>C. sativa</em>&nbsp;has been used as a 
euphoriant in India, the Near East, parts of Africa, and other Old World areas 
for thousands of years, such use simply did not develop in temperate countries 
where hemp was raised. The use of&nbsp;<em>C. sativa</em>&nbsp;as a 
recreational inebriant in sophisticated, largely urban settings is 
substantially a 20th century phenomenon.</p> 
<p><em>Cannabis</em>&nbsp;drug preparations have been employed medicinally in 
folk medicine since antiquity, and were extensively used in western medicine 
between the middle of the 19th century and World War II, particularly as a 
substitute for opiates (Mikuriya 1969). A bottle of commercial medicinal 
extract is shown in Fig. 41. Medical use declined with the introduction of 
synthetic analgesics and sedatives, and there is very limited authorized 
medical use today, but considerable unauthorized use, including so-called 
&ldquo;compassion clubs&rdquo; dispensing marijuana to gravely ill people, 
which has led to a momentous societal and scientific debate regarding the 
wisdom of employing cannabis drugs medically, given the illicit status. There 
is anecdotal evidence that cannabis drugs are useful for: alleviating nausea, 
vomiting, and anorexia following radiation therapy and chemotherapy; as an 
appetite stimulant for AIDS patients; for relieving the tremors of multiple 
sclerosis and epilepsy; and for pain relief, glaucoma, asthma, and other 
ailments [see Mechoulam and Hanus (1997) for an authoritative medical review, 
and Pate (1995) for a guide to the medical literature]. To date, governmental 
authorities in the US, on the advice of medical experts, have consistently 
rejected the authorization of medical use of marijuana except in a handful of 
cases. However, in the UK medicinal marijuana is presently being produced 
sufficient to supply thousands of patients, and Canada recently authorized the 
cultivation of medicinal marijuana for compassionate dispensation, as well as 
for a renewed effort at medical evaluation.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Fig. 41.</strong>&nbsp;Medicinal tincture of&nbsp;<em>Cannabis 
sativa</em>. (Not legal in North America.)</p> 
<p>Several of the cannabinoids are reputed to have medicinal potential: THC 
for glaucoma, spasticity from spinal injury or multiple sclerosis, pain, 
inflammation, insomnia, and asthma; CBD for some psychological problems. The 
Netherlands firm HortaPharm developed strains of&nbsp;<em>Cannabis</em>
&nbsp;rich in particular cannabinoids. The British firm G.W. Pharmaceuticals 
acquired proprietary access to these for medicinal purposes, and is developing 
medicinal marijuana. In the US, NIH (National Institute of Health) has a 
program of research into medicinal marijuana, and has supplied a handful of 
individuals for years with maintenance samples for medical usage. The American 
Drug Enforcement Administration is hostile to the medicinal use of&nbsp;<em>
Cannabis</em>, and for decades research on medicinal properties of&nbsp;<em>
Cannabis</em>&nbsp;in the US has been in an extremely inhospitable climate, 
except for projects and researchers concerned with curbing drug abuse. 
Synthetic preparations of THC&mdash;dronabinol (Marinol&reg;) and nabilone 
(Cesamet&reg;)&mdash;are permitted in some cases, but are expensive and widely 
considered to be less effective than simply smoking preparations of marijuana. 
Relatively little material needs to be cultivated for medicinal purposes (Small 
1971), although security considerations considerably inflate costs. The 
potential as a &ldquo;new crop&rdquo; for medicinal cannabinoid uses is 
therefore limited. However, the added-value potential in the form of 
proprietary drug derivatives and drug-delivery systems is huge. The medicinal 
efficacy of&nbsp;<em>Cannabis</em>&nbsp;is extremely controversial, and 
regrettably is often confounded with the issue of balancing harm and liberty 
concerning the proscriptions against recreational use of marijuana. This paper 
is principally concerned with the industrial uses of&nbsp;<em>Cannabis</em>. In 
this context, the chief significance of medicinal&nbsp;<em>Cannabis</em>
&nbsp;is that, like the issue of recreational use, it has made it very 
difficult to rationally consider the development of industrial hemp in North 
America for purposes that everyone should agree are not harmful.</p> 
<p>Key analyses of the medicinal use of marijuana are: Le Dain (1972), Health 
Council of the Netherlands (1996), American Medical Association (1997), British 
Medical Association (1997), National Institutes of Health (1997), World Health 
Organization (1997), House of Lords (1998), and Joy et al. (1999).</p> 
<h2>MINOR USES</h2> 
<h3>Biomass</h3> 
<p>It has been contended that hemp is notably superior to most crops in terms 
of biomass production, but van der Werf (1994b) noted that the annual dry 
matter yield of hemp (rarely approaching 20 t/ha) is not exceptional compared 
to maize, beet, or potato. Nevertheless, hemp has been rated on a variety of 
criteria as one of the best crops available to produce energy in Europe 
(Biewinga and van der Bijl 1996). Hemp, especially the hurds, can be burned as 
is or processed into charcoal, methanol, methane, or gasoline through pyrolysis 
(destructive distillation). As with maize, hemp can also be used to create 
ethanol. However, hemp for such biomass purposes is a doubtful venture in North 
America. Conversion of hemp biomass into fuel or alcohol is impractical on this 
continent, where there are abundant supplies of wood, and energy can be 
produced relatively cheaply from a variety of sources. Mallik et al. (1990) 
studied the possibility of using hemp for &ldquo;biogas&rdquo; (i.e. methane) 
production, and concluded that it was unsuitable for this purpose. Pinfold 
Consulting (1998) concluded that while there may be some potential for hemp 
biomass fuel near areas where hemp is cultivated, &ldquo;a fuel ethanol 
industry is not expected to develop based on hemp.&rdquo;</p> 
<h3>Essential Oil</h3> 
<p>Essential (volatile) oil in hemp is quite different from hempseed oil. 
Examples of commercial essential oil product products are shown in Fig. 42. The 
essential oil is a mixture of volatile compounds, including monoterpenes, 
sesquiterpenes, and other terpenoid-like compounds that are manufactured in the 
same epidermal glands in which the resin of&nbsp;<em>Cannabis</em>&nbsp;is 
synthesized (Meier and Mediavilla 1998). Yields are very small&mdash;about 10 
L/ha (Mediavilla and Steinemann 1997), so essential oil of&nbsp;<em>C. sativa
</em>&nbsp;is expensive, and today is simply a novelty. Essential oil of 
different strains varies considerably in odor, and this may have economic 
importance in imparting a scent to cosmetics, shampoos, soaps, creams, oils, 
perfumes, and foodstuffs. Switzerland has been a center for the production of 
essential oil for the commercial market. Narcotic strains tend to be more 
attractive in odor than fiber strains, and because they produce much higher 
numbers of flowers than fiber strains, and the (female) floral parts provide 
most of the essential oil, narcotic strains are naturally adapted to essential 
oil production. Switzerland has permitted strains with higher THC content to be 
grown than is allowed in other parts of the world, giving the country an 
advantage with respect to the essential oil market. However, essential oil in 
the marketplace has often been produced from low-THC&nbsp;<em>Cannabis</em>, 
and the THC content of essential oil obtained by steam distillation can be 
quite low, producing a product satisfying the needs for very low THC levels in 
food and other commercial goods. The composition of extracted essential oil is 
quite different from the volatiles released around the fresh plant 
(particularly limonene and alpha-pinene), so that a pleasant odor of the living 
plant is not necessarily indicative of a pleasant-smelling essential oil. 
Essential oil has been produced in Canada by Gen-X Research Inc., Regina. The 
world market for hemp essential oil is very limited at present, and probably 
also has limited growth potential.</p>

<h3>Pesticide and Repellent Potential</h3> 
<p>McPartland (1997) reviewed research on the pesticide and repellent 
applications of&nbsp;<em>Cannabis</em>. Dried plant parts and extracts of&nbsp;
<em>Cannabis</em>&nbsp;have received rather extensive usage for these purposes 
in the past, raising the possibility that research could produce formulations 
of commercial value. This possibility is currently hypothetical.</p> 
<h3>Non-Seed Use of Hemp as Livestock Feed</h3> 
<p>As noted above, hemp seed cake makes an excellent feed for animals. 
However, feeding entire plants is another matter, because the leaves are 
covered with the resin-producing glands. While deer, groundhogs, rabbits, and 
other mammals will nibble on hemp plants, mammals generally do not choose to 
eat hemp. Jain and Arora (1988) fed narcotic&nbsp;<em>Cannabis</em>&nbsp;refuse 
to cattle, and found that the animals &ldquo;<em>suffered variable degrees of 
depression and revealed incoordination in movement</em>.&rdquo; By contrast, 
Letniak et al. (2000) conducted an experimental trial of hemp as silage. No 
significant differences were found between yield of the hemp and of barley/oat 
silage fed to heifers, suggesting that fermenting hemp plants reduces possible 
harmful constituents.</p> 
<h3>Hemp as an Agricultural Barrier</h3> 
<p>One of the most curious uses of hemp is as a fence to prevent pollen 
transfer in commercial production of seeds. Isolation distances for ensuring 
that seeds produced are pure are considerable for many plants, and often 
impractical. At one point in the 1980s, the only permitted use of hemp in 
Germany was as a fence or hedge to prevent plots of beets being used for seed 
production from being contaminated by pollen from ruderal beets. The high and 
rather inpenetrable hedge that hemp can produce was considered unsurpassed by 
any other species for the purpose. As well, the sticky leaves of hemp were 
thought to trap pollen. However, Saeglitz et al. (2000) demonstrated that the 
spread of beet pollen is not effectively prevented by hemp hedges. Fiber (i.e. 
tall) cultivars of hemp were also once used in Europe as wind-breaks, 
protecting vulnerable crops against wind damage. Although hemp plants can 
lodge, on the whole very tall hemp is remarkably resistant against wind.</p> 
<h3>Bioremediation</h3> 
<p>Preliminary work in Germany (noted in Karus and Leson 1994) suggested that 
hemp could be grown on soils contaminated with heavy metals, while the fiber 
remained virtually free of the metals. Kozlowski et al. (1995) observed that 
hemp grew very well on copper-contaminated soil in Poland (although seeds 
absorbed high levels of copper). Baraniecki (1997) found similar results. 
M&ouml;lleken et al. (1997) studied effects of high concentration of salts of 
copper, chromium, and zinc on hemp, and demonstrated that some hemp cultivars 
have potential application to growth in contaminated soils. It would seem 
unwise to grow hemp as an oilseed on contaminated soils, but such a habitat 
might be suitable for a fiber or biomass crop. The possibility of using hemp 
for bioremediation deserves additional study.</p> 
<h3>Wildlife Uses</h3> 
<p>Hemp is plagued by bird predation, which take a heavy toll on seed 
production. The seeds are well known to provide extremely nutritious food for 
both wild birds and domestic fowl. Hunters and birdwatchers who discover wild 
patches of hemp often keep this information secret, knowing that the area will 
be a magnet for birds in the fall when seed maturation occurs. Increasingly in 
North America, plants are being established to provide habitat and food for 
wildlife. Hemp is not an aggressive weed, and certainly has great potential for 
being used as a wildlife plant. Of course, current conditions forbid such usage 
in North America.</p> 
<h3>Ornamental Forms</h3> 
<p>Hemp has at times in the past been grown simply for its ornamental value. 
The short, strongly-branched cultivar &lsquo;Panorama&rsquo; (Fig. 43) bred by 
Iv&aacute;n B&oacute;sca, the dean of the world&rsquo;s living hemp breeders, 
was commercialized in Hungary in the 1980s, and has been said to be the only 
ornamental hemp cultivar available. It has had limited success, of course, 
because there are very few circumstances that permit private gardeners can grow
<em>Cannabis</em>&nbsp;as an ornamental today. By contrast, beautiful 
ornamental cultivars of opium poppy are widely cultivated in home gardens 
across North America, despite their absolute illegality and the potentially 
draconian penalties that could be imposed. Doubtless in the unlikely event that 
it became possible, many would grow hemp as an ornamental.</p>

<h2>AGRONOMY</h2> 
<p>The following sketch of hemp cultivation is insufficient to address all of 
the practical problems that are encountered by hemp growers. B&oacute;csa and 
Karus (1998) is the best overall presentation of hemp growing available in 
English. The reader is warned that this book, as well as almost all of the 
literature on hemp, is very much more concerned with fiber production than 
oilseed production. McPartland et al. (2000) is the best presentation available 
on diseases and pests, which fortunately under most circumstances do limited 
damage. The resource list presented below should be consulted by those wishing 
to learn about hemp production. Provincial agronomists in Canada now have 
experience with hemp, and can make local recommendations. Particularly good web 
documents are: for Ontario (OMAFRA Hemp Series, several documents): 
www.gov.on.ca/OMAFRA/english/crops/hort/hemp.html); for Manitoba (several 
documents): www.gov.mb.ca/agriculture/crops/hemp/bko01s00.html; for British 
Columbia: (BC Ministry of Agriculture and Foods Fact Sheet on Industrial Hemp, 
prepared by A. Oliver and H. Joynt): 
www.agf.gov.bc.ca/croplive/plant/horticult/specialty/specialty.htm</p> 
<p>In the US, extension publications produced up to the end of World War II 
are still useful, albeit outdated (Robinson 1935; Wilsie et al. 1942; Hackleman 
and Domingo 1943; Wilsie et al. 1944).</p> 
<p>Hemp does best on a loose, well-aerated loam soil with high fertility and 
abundant organic matter. Well-drained clay soils can be used, but 
poorly-drained clay soils are very inappropriate because of their 
susceptibility to compaction, which is not tolerated. Young plants are 
sensitive to wet or flooded soils, so that hemp must have porous, friable, 
well-drained soils. Sandy soils will grow good hemp, provided that adequate 
irrigation and fertilization are provided, but doing so generally makes 
production uneconomical. Seedbed preparation requires considerable effort. Fall 
plowing is recommended, followed by careful preparation of a seedbed in the 
spring. The seedbed should be fine, level, and firm. Seed is best planted at 
2&ndash;3 cm (twice as deep will be tolerated). Although the seedlings will 
germinate and survive at temperatures just above freezing, soil temperatures of 
8&deg;&ndash;10&deg;C are preferable. Generally hemp should be planted after 
danger of hard freezes, and slightly before the planting date of maize. Good 
soil moisture is necessary for seed germination, and plenty of rainfall is 
needed for good growth, especially during the first 6 weeks. Seeding rate is 
specific to each variety, and this information should be sought from the 
supplier. Fiber strains are typically sown at a minimum rate of 250 seeds per 
m2 (approximately 45 kg/ha), and up to three times this density is sometimes 
recommended. In western Europe, seeding rates range from 60&ndash;70 kg/ha for 
fiber cultivars. Recommendations for seeding rates for grain production vary 
widely, from 10&ndash;45 kg/ha. Densities for seed production for tall, 
European, dual-purpose cultivars are less than for short oilseed cultivars. Low 
plant densities, as commonly found in growing tall European cultivars for seed, 
may not suppress weed growth adequately, and under these circumstances resort 
to herbicides may pose a problem for those wishing to grow hempseed 
organically. Hemp requires about the same fertility as a high-yielding crop of 
wheat. Industrial hemp grows well in areas that corn produces high yields. 
Growing hemp may require addition of up to 110 kg/ha of nitrogen, and 
40&ndash;90 kg/ha of potash. Hemp particularly requires good nitrogen 
fertilization, more so for seed production than fiber. Adding nitrogen when it 
is not necessary is deleterious to fiber production, so that knowledge of the 
fertility of soils being used is very important. Organic matter is preferably 
over 3.5%, phosphorus should be medium to high (&gt;40 ppm), potassium should 
be medium to high (&gt;250 ppm), sulfur good (&gt;5,000 ppm), and calcium not 
in excess (&lt;6,000 ppm).</p> 
<p>Finding cultivars suited to local conditions is a key to success. Hemp 
prefers warm growing conditions, and the best European fiber strains are 
photoperiodically adapted to flowering in southern Europe, which provides 
seasons of at least 4 months for fiber, and 5.5 months for seed production. 
Asian land races are similarly adapted to long seasons. In Canada, many of the 
available cultivars flower too late in the season for fiber production, and the 
same may be predicted for the northern US. Fiber production should also be 
governed by availability of moisture throughout the season, and the need for 
high humidity in the late summer and fall for retting, so that large areas of 
the interior and west of North America are not adapted to growing fiber hemp. 
The US Corn Belt has traditionally been considered to be best for fiber hemp. 
There are very few cultivars dedicated to oilseed production (such as 
&lsquo;Finola&rsquo; and &lsquo;Anka&rsquo;) or that at least are known to 
produce good oilseed crops (such as &lsquo;Fasamo&rsquo; and 
&lsquo;Uniko-B&rsquo;). Oilseed production was a specialty of the USSR, and 
there is some likelihood that northern regions of North America may find 
short-season, short-stature oilseed cultivars ideal.</p> 
<p>Although hemp can be successfully grown continuously for several years on 
the same land, rotation with other crops is desirable. A 3- or preferably 
4-year rotation may involve cereals, clover or alfalfa for green manure, maize, 
and hemp. In Ontario it has been recommended that hemp not follow canola, 
edible beans, soybeans or sunflowers. However, according to B&oacute;csa and 
Karus (1998), &ldquo;<em>it matters little what crops are grown prior to hemp
</em>.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>For a fiber crop, hemp is cut in the early flowering stage or while pollen 
is being shed, well before seeds are set. Tall European cultivars (greater than 
2 m) have mostly been grown in Canada to date, and most of these are 
photoperiodically adapted to mature late in the season (often too late). Small 
crops have been harvested with sickle-bar mowers and hay swathers, but plugging 
of equipment is a constant problem. Hemp fibers tend to wrap around combine 
belts, bearings, indeed any moving part, and have resulted in large costs of 
combine repairs (estimated at $10.00/ha). Slower operation of conventional 
combines has been recommended (0.6&ndash;2 ha/hour). Large crops may require 
European specialized equipment, but experience in North America with crops 
grown mainly for fiber is limited. The Dutch company HempFlax has developed or 
adapted several kinds of specialized harvesting equipment (Fig. 44, 45).</p> 
<br> <strong>Fig. 44.</strong>&nbsp;A John Deere Kemper harvester, with 
circular drums that cut and chop hemp stalks, shown in operation in southern 
Ontario. (Courtesy of Kenex Ltd., Pain Court, Ontario.) <strong>Fig. 45.

mowing head capable of cutting 3 m long stems into 0.6 m pieces, at a capacity 
of 3 ha/hour. (Courtesy of HempFlax, Oude Pekela, The Netherlands.) <br>
<br>

<p>Retting is generally done in the field (Fig. 46, 47). This typically 
requires weeks. The windrows should be turned once or twice. If not turned, the 
stems close to the ground will remain green while the top ones are retted and 
turn brown. When the stalks have become sufficiently retted requires 
experience&mdash;the fibers should have turned golden or grayish in color, and 
should separate easily from the interior wood. Baling can be done with any kind 
of baler (Fig. 48). Stalks should have less than 15% moisture when baled, and 
should be allowed to dry to about 10% in storage. Bales must be stored indoors. 
Retted stalks are loosely held together, and for highest quality fiber 
applications need to be decorticated, scutched, hackled, and combed to remove 
the remaining pieces of stalks, broken fibers, and extraneous material. The 
equipment for this is rare in North America, and consequently use of 
domestically-produced fiber for high quality textile applications is extremely 
limited. However, as described above relatively crude fiber preparations also 
have applications.</p> <br>

Farm, Ottawa, Canada. <strong>Fig. 47.</strong>&nbsp;Shocked fiber hemp in

<p>Harvesting tall varieties for grain is difficult. In France, the principal 
grower of dual-purpose varieties, the grain is taken off the field first, 
leaving most of the stalks for later harvest (Fig. 49). Putting tall whole 
plants through a conventional combine results in the straw winding around 
moving parts, and the fibers working into bearings, causing breakdown, fires, 
high maintenance, and frustration. Following the French example of raising the 
cutting blade to harvest the grain is advisable. Growing short varieties 
dedicated to grain production eliminates many of the above problems, and since 
the profitability of hemp straw is limited at present, seems preferable. Grain 
growers should be aware that flocks of voracious birds are a considerable 
source of damage to hempseed, particularly in small plantations.</p>

<h2>ECOLOGICAL FRIENDLINESS OF HEMP</h2> 
<p>Although the environmental and biodiversity benefits of growing hemp have 
been greatly exaggerated in the popular press,&nbsp;<em>C. sativa</em>&nbsp;is 
nevertheless exceptionally suitable for organic agriculture, and is remarkably 
less &ldquo;ecotoxic&rdquo; in comparison to most other crops (Montford and 
Small 1999b). Figure 50 presents a comparison of the ecological friendliness 
of&nbsp;<em>Cannabis</em>&nbsp;crops (fiber, oilseed, and narcotics) and 21 of 
the world&rsquo;s major crops, based on 26 criteria used by Montford and Small 
(1999a) to compare the ecological friendliness of crops.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Fig. 50.&nbsp;</strong>A crude comparison of the biodiversity 
friendliness of selected major crops and three&nbsp;<em>Cannabis sativa</em>
&nbsp;crops (fiber, oilseed, drug) based on 26 criteria (after Montford and 
Small 1999a).</p> 
<p>The most widespread claim for environmental friendliness of hemp is that it 
has the potential to save trees that otherwise would be harvested for 
production of lumber and pulp. Earlier, the limitations of hemp as a pulp 
substitute were examined. With respect to wood products, several factors appear 
to favor increased use of wood substitutes, especially agricultural fibers such 
as hemp. Deforestation, particularly the destruction of old growth forests, and 
the world&rsquo;s decreasing supply of wild timber resources are today major 
ecological concerns. Agroforestry using tree species is one useful response, 
but nevertheless sacrifices wild lands and biodiversity, and is less preferable 
than sustainable wildland forestry. The use of agricultural residues (e.g. 
straw bales in house construction) is an especially environmentally friendly 
solution to sparing trees, but material limitations restrict use. Another chief 
advantage of several annual fiber crops over forestry crops is relative 
productivity, annual fiber crops sometimes producing of the order of four times 
as much per unit of land. Still another important advantage is the precise 
control over production quantities and schedule that is possible with annual 
crops. In many parts of the world, tree crops are simply not a viable 
alternative. &ldquo;<em>By the turn of the century 3 billion people may live in 
areas where wood is cut faster than it grows or where fuelwood is extremely 
scarce</em>&rdquo; (World Commission on Environment and Development 1987). 
&ldquo;<em>Since mid-century, lumber use has tripled, paper use has increased 
six-fold, and firewood use has soared as Third World populations have multiplied
</em>&rdquo; (Brown et al. 1998). Insofar as hemp reduces the need to harvest 
trees for building materials or other products, its use as a wood substitute 
will tend to contribute to preserving biodiversity. Hemp may also enhance 
forestry management by responding to short-term fiber demand while trees reach 
their ideal maturation. In developing countries where fuelwood is becoming 
increasingly scarce and food security is a concern, the introduction of a 
dual-purpose crop such as hemp to meet food, shelter, and fuel needs may 
contribute significantly to preserving biodiversity.</p> 
<p>The most valid claims to environmental friendliness of hemp are with 
respect to agricultural biocides (pesticides, fungicides, herbicides).&nbsp;<em>
Cannabis sativa</em>&nbsp;is known to be exceptionally resistant to pests (Fig. 
51), although, the degree of immunity to attacking organisms has been greatly 
exaggerated, with several insects and fungi specializing on hemp. Despite this, 
use of pesticides and fungicides on hemp is usually unnecessary, although 
introduction of hemp to regions should be expected to generate local 
problems.&nbsp;<em>Cannabis sativa</em>&nbsp;is also relatively resistant to 
weeds, and so usually requires relatively little herbicide. Fields intended for 
hemp use are still frequently normally cleared of weeds using herbicides, but 
so long as hemp is thickly seeded (as is always done when hemp is grown for 
fiber), the rapidly developing young plants normally shade out competing weeds.
</p>

limited damage to hemp, and substantial insect damage is uncommon, so the use 
of insecticides is very rarely required.</p> 
<h2>BREEDING HEMP FOR NORTH AMERICA</h2> 
<p>The basic commercial options for growing hemp in North America is as a 
fiber plant, an oilseed crop, or for dual harvest for both seeds and fiber. 
Judged on experience in Canada to date, the industry is inclined to specialize 
on either fiber or grain, but not both. Hemp in our opinion is particularly 
suited to be developed as an oilseed crop in North America. The first and 
foremost breeding goal is to decrease the price of hempseed by creating more 
productive cultivars. While the breeding of hemp fiber cultivars has proceeded 
to the point that only slight improvements can be expected in productivity in 
the future, the genetic potential of hemp as an oilseed has scarcely been 
addressed. From the point of view of world markets, concentrating on oilseed 
hemp makes sense, because Europe has shown only limited interest to date in 
developing oilseed hemp, whereas a tradition of concentrating on profitable 
oilseed products is already well established in the US and Canada. Further, 
China&rsquo;s supremacy in the production of high-quality hemp textiles at low 
prices will be very difficult to match, while domestic production of oilseeds 
can be carried out using technology that is already available. The present 
productivity of oilseed hemp&mdash;about 1 t/ha under good conditions, and 
occasional reports of 1.5 to 2 t/ha, is not yet sufficient for the crop to 
become competitive with North America&rsquo;s major oilseeds. We suggest that 
an average productivity of 2 t/ha will be necessary to transform hempseed into 
a major oilseed, and that this breeding goal is achievable. At present, losses 
of 30% of the seed yields are not uncommon, so that improvements in harvesting 
technology should also contribute to higher yields. Hemp food products cannot 
escape their niche market status until the price of hempseed rivals that of 
other oilseeds, particularly rapeseed, flax, and sunflower. Most hemp breeding 
that has been conducted to date has been for fiber characteristics, so that 
there should be considerable improvement possible. The second breeding goal is 
for larger seeds, as these are more easily shelled. Third is breeding for 
specific seed components. Notable are the health-promoting gamma-linolenic 
acid; improving the amino acid spectrum of the protein; and increasing the 
antioxidant level, which would not only have health benefits but could increase 
the shelf life of hemp oil and foods.</p> 
<h3>Germplasm Resources</h3> 
<p>Germplasm for the improvement of hemp is vital for the future of the 
industry in North America. However, there are no publicly available germplasm 
banks housing&nbsp;<em>C. sativa</em>&nbsp;in North America. The hundreds of 
seed collections acquired for Small&rsquo;s studies (reviewed in Small 1979) 
were destroyed in 1980 because Canadian government policy at that time 
envisioned no possibility that hemp would ever be developed as a legitimate 
crop. An inquiry regarding the 56 United States Department of Agriculture hemp 
germplasm collections supplied to and grown by Small and Beckstead (1973) 
resulted in the reply that there are no remaining hemp collections in USDA 
germplasm holdings, and indeed that were such to be found they would have to be 
destroyed. While hemp has been and still is cultivated in Asia and South 
America, it is basically in Europe that germplasm banks have made efforts to 
preserve hemp seeds. The Vavilov Institute of Plant Research in St. Petersburg, 
Russia has by far the largest germplasm collection of hemp of any public gene 
bank, with about 500 collections. Detailed information on the majority of hemp 
accessions of the Vavilov Institute can be found in Anon. (1975). Budgetary 
problems in Russia have endangered the survival of this invaluable collection, 
and every effort needs to be made to find new funding to preserve it. 
Maintenance and seed generation issues for the Vavilov hemp germplasm 
collection are discussed in a number of articles in the Journal of the 
International Hemp Association (Clarke 1998b; Lemeshev et al. 1993, 1994). The 
Gatersleben gene bank of Germany, the 2nd largest public gene bank in Europe, 
has a much smaller&nbsp;<em>Cannabis</em>&nbsp;collection, with less than 40 
accessions (detailed information on the hemp accessions of the Gatersleben gene 
bank are available at fox-serv.ipk-gatersleben.de/). Because hemp is regaining 
its ancient status as an important crop, a number of private germplasm 
collections have been assembled for the breeding of cultivars as commercial 
ventures (de Meijer and van Soest 1992; de Meijer 1998), and of course these 
are available only on a restricted basis, if at all.</p> 
<p>The most pressing need of the hemp industry in North America is for the 
breeding of more productive oilseed cultivars. At present, mainly European 
cultivars are available, of which very few are suitable for specialized oilseed 
production. More importantly, hempseed oil is not competitive, except in the 
novelty niche market, with the popular food oils. As argued above, to be 
competitive, hemp should produce approximately 2 t/ha; at present 1 t/ha is 
considered average to good production. Doubling the productive capacity of a 
conventional crop would normally be considered impossible, but it needs to be 
understood just how little hemp has been developed as an oilseed. There may not 
even be extant land races of the kind of hemp oilseed strains that were once 
grown in Russia, so that except for a very few very recent oilseed cultivars, 
there has been virtually no breeding of oilseed hemp. Contrarily, hemp has been 
selected for fiber to the point that some breeders consider its productivity in 
this respect has already been maximized. Fiber strains have been selected for 
low seed production, so that most hemp germplasm has certainly not been 
selected for oilseed characteristics. By contrast, drug varieties have been 
selected for very high yield of flowers, and accordingly produce very high 
yield of seeds. Drug varieties have been observed to produce more than a 
kilogram of seed per plant, so that a target yield of several tonnes per 
hectare is conceivable (Watson and Clarke 1997). Of course, the high THC in 
drug cultivars makes these a difficult source of germplasm. However, wild 
plants of&nbsp;<em>C. sativa</em>&nbsp;have naturally undergone selection for 
high seed productivity, and are a particularly important potential source of 
breeding germplasm.</p> 
<p>Wild North American hemp is derived mostly from escaped European cultivated 
hemp imported in past centuries, perhaps especially from a revival of 
cultivation during World War II. Wild Canadian hemp is concentrated along the 
St. Lawrence and lower Great Lakes, where considerable cultivation occurred in 
the 1800s. In the US, wild hemp is best established in the American Midwest and 
Northeast, where hemp was grown historically in large amounts. Decades of 
eradication have exterminated many of the naturalized populations in North 
America. In the US, wild plants are rather contemptuously called &ldquo;ditch 
weed&rdquo; by law enforcement personnel. However, the attempts to destroy the 
wild populations are short-sighted, because they are a natural genetic 
reservoir, mostly low in THC. Wild North American plants have undergone many 
generations of natural adaptation to local conditions of climate, soil and 
pests, and accordingly it is safe to conclude that they harbor genes that are 
invaluable for the improvement of hemp cultivars. We have encountered 
exceptionally vigorous wild Canadian plants (Fig. 52), and grown wild plants 
from Europe (Fig. 53) which could prove valuable. Indeed, studies are in 
progress in Ontario to evaluate the agronomic usefulness of wild North American 
hemp. Nevertheless, present policies in North America require the eradication 
of wild hemp wherever encountered. In Europe and Asia, there is little concern 
about wild hemp, which remains a valuable resource.</p> <br>

<h2>HARD LESSONS FOR FARMERS</h2> 
<p>It is clear that there is a culture of idealistic believers in hemp in 
North America, and that there is great determination to establish the industry. 
As history has demonstrated, unbridled enthusiasm for largely untested new 
crops touted as gold mines sometimes leads to disaster. The attempt to raise 
silk in the US is probably the most egregious example. In 1826 a Congressional 
report that recommended the preparation of a practical manual on the industry 
resulted in a contagious desire to plant mulberries for silk production, with 
the eventual collapse of the industry, the loss of fortunes, and a legacy of 
&ldquo;Mulberry Streets&rdquo; in the US (Chapter 2, Bailey 1898). In the early 
1980s in Minnesota, Jerusalem artichoke was touted as a fuel, a feed, a food, 
and a sugar crop. Unfortunately there was no market for the new &ldquo;wonder 
crop&rdquo; and hundreds of farmers lost about $20 million (Paarlberg 1990). 
The level of &ldquo;hype&rdquo; associated with industrial hemp is far more 
than has been observed before for other new crops (Pinfold Consulting 1998). 
Probably more so than any plant in living memory, hemp attracts people to 
attempt its cultivation without first acquiring a realistic appreciation of the 
possible pitfalls. American presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson 
encouraged the cultivation of hemp, but both lost money trying to grow it. 
Sadly in Canada in 1999 numerous farmers contracted to grow half of 
Canada&rsquo;s crop area for hemp for the American-based Consolidated Growers 
and Processors, and with the collapse of the firm were left holding very large 
amounts of unmarketable grain and baled hemp straw. This has represented a most 
untimely setback for a fledgling industry, but at least has had a sobering 
effect on investing in hemp. In this section we emphasize why producers should 
exercise caution before getting into hemp.</p> 
<p>In Europe and Asia, hemp farming has been conducted for millennia. Although 
most countries ceased growing hemp after the second word war, some 
didn&rsquo;t, including France, China, Russia, and Hungary, so that essential 
knowledge of how to grow and process hemp was maintained. When commercial hemp 
cultivation resumed in Canada in 1997, many farmers undertook to grow the crop 
without appreciating its suitability for their situation, or for the hazards of 
an undeveloped market. Hemp was often grown on farms with marginal incomes in 
the hopes that it was a savior from a downward financial spiral. The myth that 
hemp is a wonder crop that can be grown on any soil led some to cultivate on 
soils with a history of producing poor crops; of course, a poor crop was the 
result.</p> 
<p>Market considerations also heavily determine the wisdom of investing in 
hemp. Growing hemp unfortunately has a magnetic attraction to many, so there is 
danger of overproduction. A marketing board could be useful to prevent 
unrestrained competition and price fluctuations, but is difficult to establish 
when the industry is still very small. As noted above, unwise investment in 
Canada produced a glut of seeds that resulted in price dumping and unprofitable 
levels for the majority. Cultural and production costs of hemp have been said 
to be comparable to those for corn, and while the truth of this remains to be 
confirmed, the legislative burden that accompanies hemp puts the crop at a 
unique disadvantage. Among the problems that Canadian farmers have faced are 
the challenge of government licensing (some delays, and a large learning 
curve), very expensive and sometime poor seed (farmers are not allowed to 
generate their own seed), teenagers raiding fields in the mistaken belief that 
marijuana is being grown, and great difficulties in exportation because of the 
necessity of convincing authorities that hemp is not a narcotic. Unless the 
producer participates in sharing of value-added income, large profits are 
unlikely. The industry widely recognizes that value added to the crop is the 
chief potential source of profit, as indeed for most other crops.</p> 
<h2>THE POLITICS OF&nbsp;<em>CANNABIS</em>&nbsp;WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO 
THE US</h2> 
<p><em>Cannabis</em>&nbsp;has long had an image problem, because of the 
extremely widespread use of &ldquo;narcotic&rdquo; cultivars as illegal 
intoxicants. The US Drug Enforcement Administration has the mandate of 
eliminating illicit and wild marijuana, which it does very well (Fig. 
54&ndash;56). Those interested in establishing and developing legitimate 
industries based on fiber and oilseed applications have had to struggle against 
considerable opposition from many in the political and law enforcement arenas. 
The United States National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) information web site 
on marijuana, which reflects a negative view of cannabis, is at 
www.nida.nih.gov/DrugPages/Marijuana.html, and reflects several basic fears: 
(1) growing&nbsp;<em>Cannabis</em>&nbsp;plants makes law enforcement more 
difficult, because of the need to ensure that all plants cultivated are 
legitimate; (2) utilization of legitimate&nbsp;<em>Cannabis</em>&nbsp;products 
makes it much more difficult to maintain the image of the illegitimate products 
as dangerous; (3) many in the movements backing development of hemp are doing 
so as a subterfuge to promote legalization of recreational use of marijuana; 
and (4) THC (and perhaps other constituents) in&nbsp;<em>Cannabis</em>&nbsp;are 
so harmful that their presence in any amount in any material (food, medicine or 
even fiber product) represents a health hazard that is best dealt with by a 
total proscription.</p> <br>

<p>Ten years ago hemp cultivation was illegal in Germany, England, Canada, 
Australia, and other countries. Essential to overcoming governmental reluctance 
in each country was the presentation of an image that was business-oriented, 
and conservative. The merits of environmentalism have acquired some political 
support, but unless there is a reasonable possibility that hemp cultivation is 
perceived as potentially economically viable, there is limited prospect of 
having anti-hemp laws changed. Strong support from business and farm groups is 
indispensable; support from pro-marijuana interests and what are perceived of 
as fringe groups is generally counterproductive. It is a combination of 
prospective economic benefit coupled with assurance that hemp cultivation will 
not detrimentally affect the enforcement of marijuana legislation that has led 
most industrially advanced countries to reverse prohibitions against growing 
hemp. Should the US permit commercial hemp cultivation to resume, it will 
likely be for the same reasons.</p> 
<p>The US Office of National Drug control Policy issued a statement on 
industrial hemp in 1997 (www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/policy/hemp%5Fold.html) 
which included the following: &ldquo;<em>Our primary concern about the 
legalization of the cultivation of industrial hemp (</em>Cannabis sativa<em>) 
is the message it would send to the public at large, especially to our youth at 
a time when adolescent drug use is rising rapidly&hellip; The second major 
concern is that legalizing hemp production may mean the de facto legalization 
of marijuana cultivation. Industrial hemp and marijuana are the product of the 
same plant,&nbsp;</em>Cannabis sativa<em>&hellip; Supporters of the hemp 
legalization effort claim hemp cultivation could be profitable for US farmers. 
However, according to the USDA and the US Department of Commerce, the 
profitability of industrial hemp is highly uncertain and probably unlikely. 
Hemp is a novelty product with limited sustainable development value even in a 
novelty market&hellip; For every proposed use of industrial hemp, there already 
exists an available product, or raw material, which is cheaper to manufacture 
and provides better market results&hellip;. Countries with low labor costs such 
as the Philippines and China have a competitive advantage over any US hemp 
producer</em>.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Recent European Commission proposals to change its subsidy regime for hemp 
contained the following negative evaluation of hemp seed: &ldquo;<em>The use of 
hemp seed &hellip; would, however, even in the absence of THC, contribute 
towards making the narcotic use of cannabis acceptable&hellip; In this light, 
subsidy will be denied producers who are growing grain for use in human 
nutrition and cosmetics</em>.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>A USDA analysis of hemp, &ldquo;<em>Industrial hemp in the United States: 
Status and market potential</em>,&rdquo; was issued in 2000, and is available 
at www.ers.usda.gov/publications/ages001e/index.htm. This is 
anonymously-authored, therefore presumably represents a corporate or 
&ldquo;official&rdquo; evaluation. The conclusion was that &ldquo;<em>US 
markets for hemp fiber (specialty textiles, paper, and composites) and seed (in 
food or crushed for oil) are, and will likely remain, small, thin markets. 
Uncertainty about longrun demand for hemp products and the potential for 
oversupply discounts the prospects for hemp as an economically viable 
alternative crop for American farmers</em>.&rdquo; Noting the oversupply of 
hempseeds associated with Canada&rsquo;s 12,000 ha in 1999, the report 
concluded that the long term demand for hemp products is uncertain, and 
predicts that the hemp market in the US will likely remain small and limited. 
With respect to textiles, the report noted the lack of a thriving textile flax 
(linen) US industry (despite lack of legal barriers), so that it would seem 
unlikely that hemp could achieve a better market status. With respect to hemp 
oil, the report noted that hemp oil in food markets is limited by its short 
shelf life, the fact that it can not be used for frying, and the lack of US 
Food and Drug Administration approval as GRAS (&ldquo;generally recognized as 
safe&rdquo;). Moreover, summarizing four state analyses of hemp production 
(McNulty 1995, Ehrensing 1998, Kraenzel et al. 1998, Thompson et al. 1998), 
profitability seemed doubtful.</p> 
<p>Without arguing the merits of the above contentions, we point out that the 
legitimate use of hemp for non-intoxicant purposes has been inhibited by the 
continuing ferocious war against drug abuse. In this atmosphere, objective 
analysis has often been lacking. Unfortunately both proponents and opponents 
have tended to engage in exaggeration. Increasingly, however, the world is 
testing the potential of hemp in the field and marketplace, which surely must 
be the ultimate arbiters. De Guzman (2001), noting the pessimistic USDA report, 
observed that &ldquo;<em>Nevertheless, others point to the potential of [the] 
market. Hemp products have a growing niche market of their own, and the market 
will remain healthy and be well supported with many competing brands</em>
.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>A wide variety of hemp clothing, footwear, and food products are now 
available in North America. Some American manufacturers and distributors have 
chosen to exploit the association of hemp products with marijuana in their 
advertising. Such marketing is unfortunate, sending the message that some in 
the industry are indifferent to the negative image that this generates in the 
minds of much of the potential consuming public. Admittedly, such advertising 
works. But marketing based on the healthful and tasteful properties of hemp 
food products, the durable nature of hemp textiles, and the environmental 
advantages of the crop has proven to be widely acceptable, and is likely to 
promote the long term development of hemp industries.</p> 
<p>Will hemp commercial cultivation resume in the US in the foreseeable 
future? This is difficult to judge, but the following considerations suggest 
this might occur: (1) increasing awareness of the differences between 
industrial hemp and marijuana; (2) growing appreciation of the environmental 
benefits of hemp cultivation; (3) continuing demonstration of successful hemp 
cultivation and development in most of the remaining western world; all the G8 
countries, except the US, produce and export industrial hemp; and (4) 
increasing pressure on state and federal governments to permit hemp cultivation 
by farmers, particularly wheat, corn, and tobacco farmers in desperate need of 
substitute crops, but also for rotation crops to break pest and disease cycles.
</p> 
<p>More than a century ago, an expert on hemp concluded his manual on 
hemp-growing in the US by stating &ldquo;<em>There is no question that when the 
inventive genius, comprehension and energies of the American people become 
interested, another grand source of profitable employment and prosperity will 
be established</em>&rdquo; (Boyce 1900).</p> 
<h2>MARKET DEVELOPMENT</h2> 
<p>Individual entrepreneurs, and indeed whole industries, as a matter of 
economic survival need to adopt a clear investment policy with respect to 
whether their market is to be output-driven or demand-led. From the individual 
producer&rsquo;s perspective, the old adage &ldquo;<em>find your market before 
you plant your seed</em>&rdquo; remains sound advice.</p> 
<p>In the mid 1990s, the EU provided subsidization for hemp cultivation of ca. 
$1,050/ha. This support was instrumental in developing a hemp industry in 
western Europe. However, no comparable support is available in North America, 
and indeed those contemplating entering into hemp cultivation are faced with 
extraordinary costs and/or requirements in connection with licensing, security, 
THC analysis, and record keeping. Those involved in value-added processing and 
distribution are also faced with legal uncertainties and the regular threat of 
idiosyncratic, indeed irrational actions of various governments. Simply 
displaying a&nbsp;<em>C. sativa</em>&nbsp;leaf on advertising has led to the 
threat of criminal charges in the last decade in several G8 countries. 
Attempting to export or import hemp products among countries is presently a 
most uncertain activity.</p> 
<p>It often takes 10 to 15 years for the industry associated with a new 
agricultural crop to mature. While it is true that foreign imports have been 
the basis for hemp products in North America for at least a decade, North 
American production is only 4 years of age in Canada, and farming of hemp in 
the US has not even begun. Viewed from this perspective, the hemp industry in 
North America is still very much in its infancy. Varieties of hemp specifically 
suited to given products and regions have only started to be developed in North 
America. There is considerable uncertainty regarding yields, costs of 
production, harvesting and processing equipment, product characteristics, 
foreign competition, governmental support, and the vagaries of the regulatory 
environment. Hemp is not presently a standard crop, and is likely to continue 
experiencing the risks inherent in a small niche market for some time. Hemp is 
currently a most uncertain crop, but has such a diversity of possible uses, is 
being promoted by extremely enthusiastic market developers, and attracts so 
much attention that it is likely to carve out a much larger share of the North 
American marketplace than its detractors are willing to concede.</p> 
<p>Given the uncertainties and handicaps associated with hemp, it is fortunate 
that there are compensating factors. As noted, as a crop hemp offers some real 
environmental advantages, particularly with regard to the limited needs for 
herbicides and pesticides. Hemp is therefore pre-adapted to organic 
agriculture, and accordingly to the growing market for products associated with 
environmentally-friendly, sustainable production. Hemp products are an 
advertiser&rsquo;s dream, lending themselves to hyperbole (&ldquo;healthiest 
salad oil in the world,&rdquo; &ldquo;toughest jeans on the market&rdquo;). 
While the narcotics image of&nbsp;<em>C. sativa</em>&nbsp;is often 
disadvantageous, advertisers who choose to play up this association do so 
knowing that it will attract a segment of the consuming population. In general, 
the novelty of hemp means that many consumers are willing to pay a premium 
price. It might also be said that those who have entered the hemp industry have 
tended to be very highly motivated, resourceful, and industrious, qualities 
that have been needed in the face of rather formidable obstacles to progress.
