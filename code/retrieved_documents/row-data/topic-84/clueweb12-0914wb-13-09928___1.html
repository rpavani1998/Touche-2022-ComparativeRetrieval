<h2> Goat Milk vs. Cow Milk </h2> <br>

<h1>Goats' Milk Is More Beneficial To Health Than Cows' Milk, Study Suggests
</h1> 
<p>ScienceDaily (July 31, 2007) &mdash; Researchers have carried out a 
comparative study on the properties of goats' milk compared to those of cows' 
milk. They found reason to believe that goats' milk could help prevent diseases 
such as anemia and bone demineralization. Goats' milk was found to help with 
the digestive and metabolic utilization of minerals such as iron, calcium, 
phosphorus and magnesium.</p> <em>See also:</em>  &nbsp; <strong>Health &amp;

<p>Research carried out at the Department of Physiology of the University of 
Granada has revealed that goat milk has more beneficial properties to health 
than cow milk. Among these properties it helps to prevent ferropenic anaemia 
(iron deficiency) and bone demineralisation (softening of the bones).</p> 
<p>This project, conducted by Doctor Javier D&iacute;az Castro and directed by 
professors Margarita S&aacute;nchez Campos, M&ordf; Inmaculada L&oacute;pez 
Aliaga and M&ordf; Jos&eacute; Mu&ntilde;oz Alf&eacute;rez, focuses on the 
comparison between the nutritional properties of goat milk and cow milk, both 
with normal calcium content and calcium enriched, against the bioavailability 
of iron, calcium, phosphorus and magnesium. To carry out this study, the 
metabolic balance technique has been used both in rats with experimentally 
induced nutritional ferropenic anaemia and in a control group of rats.</p> 
<p>In order to know how the nutritive utilisation of these minerals may affect 
their metabolic distribution and destination, the UGR researcher has determined 
the concentration of these minerals in the different organs involved in their 
homeostatic regulation and different haematological parameters in relation to 
the metabolism of the minerals.</p> 
<p><strong>Better results with goat milk</strong></p> 
<p>Results obtained in the study reveal that ferropenic anaemia and bone 
demineralisation caused by this pathology have a better recovery with goat 
milk. Due to the higher bioavailability of iron, calcium, phosphorus and 
magnesium, the restoration of altered haematological parameters and the better 
levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), a hormone that regulates the calcium 
balance in the organism was found in the rats that consumed this food.</p> 
<p>Javier D&iacute;az Castro points out that the inclusion of goat milk with 
normal or double calcium content in the diet &ldquo;favours digestive and 
metabolic utilisation of iron, calcium and phosphorus and their deposit in 
target organs - parts of the organism to which these minerals are preferably 
sent - involved in their homeostatic regulation.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>According to this researcher, all these conclusions reveal that regular 
consumption of goat milk &ndash; a natural food with highly beneficial 
nutritional characteristics - &ldquo;has positive effects on mineral 
metabolism, recovery from ferropenic anaemia and bone mineralisation in rats. 
In addition, and unlike observations in cow milk, its calcium enrichment does 
not interfere in the bioavailability of the minerals studied.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Although there is no doubt that these findings may be a base for further in 
depth study of the multiple health benefits of goat milk, the UGR researcher 
warns that &ldquo;studies in humans are still required in order to confirm the 
findings obtained in rats and to promote goat milk consumption both in the 
general population and in the population affected by nutritional ferropenic 
anaemia and pathologies related to bone demineralisation.&rdquo; Part of the 
results of this research has been published in the International Dairy Journal 
and Journal Dairy Science.</p>
